333,"yes, very good, new york, just turn the volume a little up, < slaughter>, eh for a change, yeah, it's good., i wanted to <wa>, i wanted to see what los angeles was all about., uh, probably lasted a year or two., you know i'm away from my family., what i was used to in new york, the neighborhoods the people and only ever acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here, the weather, you can't beat the weather, it's usually always nice, it's not too hot, it's not too cold, it's creative, i like movies., like the beach, transport, there's a lot of traffic, uh , some of the sometimes i think the people here are a little colder than and more distant and unfriendly than other places, i was a history major, no, uh i do uh demonstrations in really <rea>, uh high end supermarkets, uh being a screenwriter, this is one of the reasons why i came to go angels, it's hard because i don't always uh focus and motivation, i'm getting distracted from other things, < slaughter>, i've always been interested in movies since i was a kid., and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination, i've been in the last, likely, almost ten years i have travelled more than i had in the past <pa> well, i have always traveled, even as a child my parents would travel around, so yes., seeing new places and uh seeing people who are different than i see how they live, and take to the sights, uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever had to go on the safari and, just going out in a jeep and seeing <laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible, oh yes, this is one of the great experiences of my life, and i also got to uh, a place in egypt uh at the end of this trip, um, uh, called uh, sharm el sheikh, which is right on the water and it has some of the best diving in the world that is hard to believe that, egypt would but it was just amazing i left <we> i didn't go diving i went uh snorkeling, what do i do to relax uh i do i like to listen to music, i like watching movies helps me relax, because it brings me out of you to know whatever could be in my head, i meditate every day, i like to take walks in nature, which is always reassuring, especially down at the uh of the ocean, uh, what it depends on <laughter> sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times, uh , i will do like a form of self hypnosis and calm myself down, which is something i have recently learned how to do, which is very helpful, and also since i'm not meditating it about things as easily annoyed as i have done in the past, some things that really makes me angry, i think uh think about injustice, done in the world or to people when, uh, it doesn't really have to be that we could all get along., um , and make the world better, last night, i was at a film screening., from an independent movie and i didn't think it was done very well, it's not so much that we had a funny argument, about uh about the movie, it was like you knew that happened yesterday, so it was in my head., < slaughter>, there is everything i regret yes there are possibilities in my life, that i wish i had, uh took her and persecuted her, uh certain jobs, you know, the first time i got out of angeles, i had an opportunity, uh, become a handle, and uh and i probably should've tracked that, how did i decide that i don't really understand the questions?, take advantage of every opportunity that came my way, always <alway> i think say yes, uh on every occasion is very important and doesn't matter, how you think you know you need to be confident that you will be able to achieve what you want to do, no, but i was depressed in my life., uh for the most part i have felt good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh, i think you sometimes know if i allow <allo>, regret to come into my mind that can bring me down, but i can usually tell you to come out when it's pretty fast, uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh, an opportunity around how to explain it anyway there, sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is a way i that if i had made another decision, i could have more money or my life would be different, um , not really i mean i feel, pretty much the same, what made me look for help for <laughter>?, i've been good okay, it generally helped talk to someone when i did that., i have no problem sleeping., uh , usually i'm grumpy <laughter> so if i don't sleep well uh you know i feel tired and irritable, uh , how would my best friend describe me, that's a good question about friendly <f> well, i'm friendly <f> i'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little mysterious, to i would probably that i should, they would like to see me achieve more and uh and uh reach my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier, i think.., it's hard, it depends, sometimes i'm very introverted because i like to write so it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i'm out of this uh i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself with, as one hard way or the other everything depends on my situation and my mood, my best qualities around, i think i'll take care of it, i think i'm smart, i think i'm funny, i'm going out., um, i have a sympathetic personality, you know that people said that, i'm captivating, but not oppressive or overly captivating, there's some kind of cool detachment., um, and creatively intuitive, <laughter> yes <laughter>, the last time i felt really happy, i don't know that i woke up this morning, i was pretty happy, i had breakfast i was happy, the sun was shining, < slaughter>, um , i think like i said to go to kenya, was an unforgettable experience i remember scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience that i remembered you saw all the colors in the ocean, you know, and feel the sun powerful sun on my back, um, almost about what you know because <beca> almost over, people in a way just in contact with everything that the universe, yes, it would be nice to feel that way, any moment of the day, but, what i am most proud of in my life, i think i've.., help, <ft> persons, uh and, sometimes when they were in crisis, you know i wrote some scripts., um , i had good relationships., to be good relationships only you know to be connected to someone else you know, spending time with them, and connection, on emotional and, <laughter> physical and, psychic levels, what could be a song i hear on the radio?, uh, it could be uh., many times you look forward to something you know when i go into a movie bowling, hanging with people, um, they know how to look at the work, and to work and feel productive can put me in it brings me into a good mood, you're welcome., see you.",5
304,"i'm doing good., from los engeles california, around the cool weather the beaches the people the schools, development of children, yes, to be a teacher of special education, it's not hard because i love working with children., yes, dishonesty, perhaps, um, like when a guy like especially when it comes to relationships, when they lie to you about something that's very minimal, my mom i want to say my mom, to very close we talk every day, very close, although i don't live with them, i try to see them as much as i can, it's okay <laughter>, it's good., it's, yes, i do., they're friendly, it's just that they're very quiet., because i didn't get used to this environment., it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap, so that's good and they're friendly, so it's okay, i wish it would have been a little better, so yeah, yes <laughter>, i had another way to live with someone else., and i'm still friends with the woman and i come to find out that we're connecting more than the roommates i live with, so i'm sorry to move in with the roommates i have now, against whom i should have moved in the beginning, so, but i'm stuck for a year, so it's whatever it is, that's all right., how do i know who, i, yes <laughter>, there's nothing that really makes me angry that i can think of at the top of my head, um, um, maybe when it comes to schools, how they might treat the children especially colored, that makes me really angry, mm yes, because i do things from within i think so to do things internally motivated i guess yes, yeah, that's good., wow, i hardly argue with anyone <laughter>, yeah, that's good., oh my sister, i guess my sister who was about a month ago, uh i felt very cheated and insulted because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespectful to me in any way because i'm an adult, so yeah i didn't feel the situation at all, um, only that she interferes in the business of adult people and, it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she heard what was being said, and she felt like through my actions that i chose someone else about my family if that wasn't even the case, but because she didn't know the whole situation that she just automatically accepted and put stuff on facebook about me disrespectfully calling me by name and it was just so <laughter>, and she then comes to me about it as she did all these other things on facebook i don't, that's one thing i don't like is if you hate i have indirect comments like if you have to talk to me directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people, this is a pet peeve of mine, so i really don't like it., yeah, well, i mean, we're fine now., so that's good., yeah, that's good., not, people so easy to believe, so gullible, not so gullible, i guess i've heard that lately, as i think, someone is saying something that someone is saying without really thinking about it or without them proving it, so i think you could say i had a lot of mistakes i don't want to say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than i was getting older and going through the same situations so around, yes, i think people are too easy and i give people too many chances, so, yeah, that's good., when i went on a cruise that was a happy experience when i went on a cruise with my family to mexico when i was sixteen, about six years ago, yes <laughter>, yes, i mean yes, i guess it was <laughter>, no, i really want it., um, try to see new things new views of the world around trying to see the different types of food around how the government is and how they run things out there i think, um, yeah, i'm planning to go to the bahamas next year., i plan to actually do a lot of travel next year, so, yeah, that's good., it's pretty good., oh, kind of., i'm tired <laughter> and i fall asleep in class and what's not, yeah, that's good., it's my fault., ahem probably today, yeah, that's good., well, i fell asleep late, so it's my fault., no, i feel pretty happy now., mhm, no, very friendly and funny, talkative, to get through high school, we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week i'll try to see them at least every few months, they are everywhere <laughter> around yeah, no comment on this, they're smarter, they learn more than we learned in the day they learn, they're very advanced, but when it comes to technology, they're not out, they're always on the computer on their phones, they don't play outside anymore, they don't care about nature or the little things in life, they just do, but when it comes to their mentality, they argue smarter, because the schools get better, i won't lie that way., when what happened, i was just.., all right., last weekend i guess, right now., um , what did i do?, being with my boyfriend makes me really happy, so i just hung out with him last weekend and i can never see him that much, yeah, because he works i have school different schedules, it's not that bad <laughter>, he's my friend i've known for six months., we met by a friend together, in l a i guess, all right., you're welcome., see you.",6
437,"<synch>, mm yes, mm i'm doing pretty good, uh i was born in los angeles, mhm, um i like the diversity of the city all the attractions and things that you can see um the food restaurants, things like that, traffic, freeways, crime, mm, uh yes i do, mhm, um seeing new places or going back and seeing same places and just enjoying relaxing getting away from l_a, uh well let's see last trip, i made was up to the central coast up in uh cambria and pismo beach area and um solvang santa ynez, uh huh, yeah, probably uh when i got to study abroad in madrid spain when i was a student at u_c_l_a, uh huh in terms of travel, uh yeah i was um i participated in the uh education abroad program at u_c_l_a where you go live in another country to learn the language and you live there for a year, at the university <univers> and you study at the university, and uh it it was just a memorable year something <someth> an experience that i would never <laughter> forget, thanks, probably more shy but uh sometimes i could be outgoing, um i'm more shy in terms of you know i it takes me it takes time <t> time for me to get to know people i mean i'm not a real party person i don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that, but if i if i'm among friends and things like that then i can be pretty outgoing, with people i know, <laughter>, <laughter>, <laughter>, um drink wine, um, yeah drink wine maybe listen to some uh, nice music, pretty good i can i'm pretty good at controlling my emotions, oh gosh um, i wouldn't say it was a real argument it was more like a what just a, discussion maybe, about, finances maybe, money, um just, oh just a little irritated <laughter>, but um not really, not really strong emotional, uh, wow gosh i <laughter>, i can't think of anything at the moment so uh let's uh skip that one, um, mm maybe uh, eating eating more junk food than i admit to, or, the hardest decision i ever had to make, uh, maybe uh, buying a home <h> buying a home, or remodeling the home, spending money for, uh, i it was um, i felt it was time to move on with my life and uh to uh buy a place for myself so i could be self-sufficient and independent, , yes very happy, thank you, uh an event i could erase from my uh, when i um yeah when i was a student <stud> when i was a student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential and discovered i never enjoyed it, i wanna erase that whole year nineteen eighty three, uh it just brought back horrible <laughter> it just brings back <laughter> horrible memories of uh what i went through when i was student teaching and uh discovered that that, teaching k twelve was not was <w> not for me, i studied <stud> my major was spanish and linguistics, i was very good at foreign languages and i thought um i enjoyed taking them and i was just having a good time taking foreign language and uh, i was getting good grades so i thought maybe this is what i should go into, foreign languages, uh i was teaching <teachi> i was an adult ed teacher teaching english as a second language for thirty years and i just recently uh decided to uh retire myself, um, i have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters my father passed away in two thousand eight and um, uh my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members, yeah, but uh on the on the whole um we have pretty good relation with the rest of my family now, um pretty easy i don't have any problems, um if i don't sleep well i'm i may be moving around in the bed and you know um, messing up the sheets but that doesn't happen too often, oh pretty good i think i've been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anything, no, no, no, uh last time i was really happy, uh probably uh when spring break came around it was uh vacation time and it was time to uh <laughter> go on our trip, uh yeah it was um it was a week trip up to central coast to uh cambria and pismo beach and santa ynez, it was just a nice getaway relaxing on the uh <laughter> hotel lawn and garden drinking wine, and uh enjoying different sights and eating good food and <laughter>, and buying wine to replenish our dwindling supply at home, <laughter> thanks, uh i think she would describe me as um, eh, kind and sweet and um, motivated and uh just a nice person, oh i'd say sometimes i wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing i guess, i tend to be more reserved, so i wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things but, mm, uh really badly about myself, uh let's see probably when i betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when i uh taped them when i taped them singing christmas carols and i, i played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that, yeah but uh it all it all got resolved at the end we all <laughter> we became <beca> we were all <laughter> it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part, but it worked out okay, yeah, um probably having, done what i did by <laughter> playing it to other people, uh, what advice would i give myself, ten or twenty years ago um, uh don't give up just uh keep uh <laughter> keep pursuing what you want and uh never never give up , see it as a, and as a disappointment if nothing <noth> if it doesn't work out, um, i'm a i'm a good listener, um i'm a, i'm a motivated person i'm hardworking i'm conscientious i'm caring, um, i'm generally a pretty happy type person, something recently, what i really enjoyed, uh, going to the uh going to the festival of books at u_s_c, this weekend, uh yeah uh the festival of books is a it's a festival where they have all these uh book mm book authors <auth> authors and, they have demonstrations <dem> food demostrations and seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and uh, there's uh lots of food and um, and a lot of uh authors signing books and things, uh it's a great event for <laughter> just to <laughter> get out and and it was nice weather too so it was nice to be out there, mhm, yeah i really enjoyed that especially the food, thanks, most proud of um, most proud of uh probably uh, being successful in my work uh in my life in my marriage and, just um yeah just basically being happy with myself, oh you're welcome, bye",0
417,"yes, i'm fine., uh los narrower <laughter>, i don't know <laughter>, um, it's kind of dirty, but that's to be expected from a big city, to my last class i took was a sociology class, i'm not sure where i'm going with school, but i'm thinking about sex education, i think it's a really important job., i feel like, uh, because there's some kind of uh, stigma i think about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies, so i feel like it's a very important job for, the world <laughter>, i don't know <laughter>, no, lack of resources, it depends on the people, but i would say that i'm generally more shy., of course with people i know well, as if they were closer to me i am more going away, to play with my dogs, uh, i don't know if it's a nice day, i'm going for a walk., um, if it's not a nice day, or if it's cold or something, uh maybe you see a show on t v i like or read a book or something, i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper., i can't remember thinking the last person i argued with, was my friend, probably last week, but i don't even remember what it was about <laughter>, um, i don't think i feel really guilty about everything i would say i regret things, but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret., as i think guilt is more like a bad feeling, but regret is like, you should have made another decision., i think this can help you in, better decisions to make in the future while guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <laughter>, um, i don't regret doing better when i was in high school, um, uh, i don't mean getting better grades, um, i regret uh, how to engage with certain people in the past, but i mean, i'm not sure <laughter>, that's what i'm thinking about right now <laughter>, hm, um, yeah, i mean, in the past., yeah, i could have done it., different decisions, i mean obviously some things that you know you're not quite in your control, but i won't feel like i'm not gonna regret things that i had no power over so, um, i don't know if i want to erase it from my memory., but, i wish it hadn't happened to me when i was raped., <laughter> i can't imagine tough decisions., hm, i can't think of a laughter. , hm, i'm not sure <laughter> i can't imagine any, i have a pretty good relationship with my family., uh not, i wouldn't say i'm really close to my mother, but i mean, we get along well., and i'm very close to my sister, we're basically best friends, um, hm, i think my mother was a positive influence in my life, uh, because she was always able to take care of me and she always, i didn't mean she did it., like mistakes sometimes, but i think she was always there for me when i needed it, and she did her best to educate me., i think she was a great positive influence, it's been easy lately., sometimes i have trouble sleeping, but uh, lately i have had no problems, um, it depends on how long i have gone without sleep, i can only, be somewhere from like, to like groggy around, really at the edge, and how to, extremely tired <laughter> i don't know, i felt, pretty good i uh, i'm kind of like general fear all the time, but it's not as bad as it's been, in the past, so, mostly felt pretty good, i think i really felt, more happy in recent times, i wouldn't say that all the time i'm really happy i'm usually just kind of, for example , um, neutral, but i have the feeling, more recent positive, i'm not sure i was diagnosed with p t s d., um, uh, i know that i uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like, since i was sixteen, ahem for depression, and i think my first psychologist i saw for a few years, thought i had p t s d, but i'm not sure if she, ever made a diagnosis, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, uh, i am <laughter> i don't know, yes, um, it's helpful, uh, talk to someone and have them somehow, um, you can take part in, talk about something so you can figure out the thing that your, feelings about things i think for yourself or how it helps to talk to someone because you can figure out why you feel a certain way about something, i mean,, i think you can do this on your own sometimes, but.., uh, talking to someone helps me think, um, hm, i'm not sure <laughter>, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, uh, i think i'd spend it most of the time., at home, but it would be sunny outside and i would go outside a little, and i would play with my dogs and, uh, i'd probably have my friend over., um, i'd eat food i like, like just food i like my favorite food around, clock, movie or t v show that i like, um, only, kind of have like a relaxing time, but, that's nice., mm, i'd say to myself, uh, to make it better at school because i was kind of an underachiever during high school, and i ended up at community college going like this because i want to, lose type of interest and then, uh not doing well, or as good as i could have, so i'd say to myself,, do as well as i could at school because i feel i'm able to do too much more, when i do it, and i think i would have easily received a scholarship if i had done well in high school, so i'd say good at school, probably warn me of one or two people who, turned out not worth my time <laughter>, um, hm, um, i think i'm, proud of me, for not, be, bitter and for willful, to, uh, well, i'm kind of bitter i guess but i guess i'm proud of myself, for not being selfish and wanting, to make the world a better place, because a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to stay instead., i'm trying to, um, or i want to, to make things better for other people, and as much as i want to help i think to empower people to make their lives better, see you.",7
375,"yes, good, it's been a nice day, the south bay, can i ask you that question too, oh okay, that's where i'm from basically but like the south bay of it, not much i've been wanting to move anyways, just to get a change-up everybody thinks l_a is like, everything it's the best but, it's too many people and too much traffic, i can't see your shoes, driving and seeing new stuff, last year i went to sacramento, from here and, stayed out for like a month living in my v_w bus with my wife it was kinda cool camping, just wanted to have fun something different, art, no a little bit, probably doing what you're doing, i'm really interested in coming up with new ideas and stuff too, outgoing, i haven't been doing much to do relax relaxing lately but i like the beach, good, i argued with my brother last night actually about him, talking to me with with more respect, as a person, i was mad and i wanted to fight, it's good but sometimes they're just, they're too caught up in what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings, like with my brother he's just, he's just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush <br> brush it off on me, wasting money 'cause i'm married now, yeah not doing it, something like probably taking some candy from the store no no, taking money from my mom when i was like real young, 'cause she, well i was like i was in junior high school and, i think i took like twenty from her purse and bought candy for my friends and, i felt guilty though like the same day, probably yeah that was probably the beginning of my stupid activities, all my life or in the past couple years, my wife, i'm married to her, we've known each other for about two years, i met her at an art walk, she actually went to u_s_c too, the past couple days has been, kinda hard but i usually go to sleep good, i think i'm kinda snappy <sn> i think i'm snappy, positive optimistic, yeah, i've been thinking more positive positively lately, and i wanna put a lot of stuff into action so i've been trying to train my mind into, knowing that stuff is gonna come to me, speaking to the universe, easy if you just try it and do it, everybody's got a spirit, no, no, no i just told you i feel positive, i was happy yesterday <yester> i happy yesterday 'cause i you know i made a couple good decisions, wanting to be positive and stay away from negative people, being alive, knowing god, i don't know, i don't know i can't think of something now, mm i don't think i can have one, sex, exercising, waking up positive and having a good meal in the morning, i think driving to sacramento that time, no, don't smoke cigarettes and watch how you spend your money, are you gonna sell my ideas and my my uh <laughter>, thoughts, i can't think of it right now",5
312,"yes, fine how about you, here, yes, the weather, weather mainly, yeah the main <ma> the weather, sorry, not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people, okay i'm cutting you off, not as much as i used to, um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt, i don't, i don't enjoy traveling, uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly, yes i am actually, right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire, impressive, professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that, where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest, you're actually pretty good at this, <sigh> i there's a lot of people, the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know, he's the first one who taught me that, school was not about a grade but about learning, okay, i'm pretty good i think, i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about, he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good, um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all, fairly close um, i see them pretty , pretty often parents i see a couple times a week, they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that, and my brother i see , same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also, interesting, yes, because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading, and not talking to anybody that's introverted, i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot, i try to at least, i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing, um, and that's about it i think, <deep breath>, bad parenting, basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just , do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion, <sigh>, um, i guess, , um, , , thank you, i don't really have a best friend, introverted remember, i'm biased obviously, but they are, i'm really good in math, i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is, it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think, and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway, that type of thing, when i a good workout , doing well in video games small little things like that, um, what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood, thank you, right now, it's the fact that, research that i did i did make it this far, research wise that's all, that's all, interesting um, when you start off in school, you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics, and, you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it, and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you, as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid, okay, um, a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class, thank you, yes briefly , many years ago <ag> yes, i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that , um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen, i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two, yes, not really, i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much, graduate school, in physics, no, nope, it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before, if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard, i guess moderately , thank you, yes, it's okay, i'm probably like i am now, normal i think not as not as happy about everything but still pretty okay i can still function, no, maybe slightly, sorry, no, yes, yes i have changes in my thoughts, um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that, what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school, i understand, okay, i agree, no not really, probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um, twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen, um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well, even though it's not perfect now i think i'm doing really well personally, thank you, same here, goodbye",2
447,"<sync>, yeah that's perfectly fine, i'm feeling great uh it's an early morning i don't have school, i'm excited <laughter>, uh born and raised in los angeles california, mhm, uh the fact that you can surf snowboard and like, do two drastically different things in one day, uh coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in uh <tisk> i'd say the population of uh, lower socio economic backgrounds it it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks, uh not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but, pretty young, hmm <laughter>, uh mostly if i'm traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing it's remarkable, uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old, and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh, we left, um <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change, the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza, it was it was delicious <laughter>, yep <laughter>, , graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications, so i can go into the military as an officer, actually it's like what, i don't know it's like, you gotta have a plan, and that's the only thing that's just fallen into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me, hmm to be honest a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it's, however you can get paid to do nothing <laughter>, yeah, but uh, probably, i was just definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken, uh i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights, i'm pretty good um, i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year, and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do, decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets, uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's, i don't i don't know, probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature, um <sigh>, hm <sigh>, so many um, i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in the applications and i'm pretty sure i would've been admitted, so it sucks but, hey, that is an intriguing question <sigh> um, i've actually no clue, the death of my grandmother, sure, um, my grandmother died when i was eleven years old, she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me, she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well, and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family, and <sigh> the closest thing i've had to a mother, and it was it was tough but, um it's gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth, and uh i've grown quite a bit no more tears, uh i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now, but um my immediate family i'm pretty close with them, and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was five so it's been pretty cool, fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting you know then it's a problem, mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively <laughter>, uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work, uh sure um hm hm uh, i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets, and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail, that you couldn't be excused from not making <ma> making your court date so i had, three failure to appears in court which sucked, tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so, i don't know, it's it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but, there're so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didn't forsee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and, yeah, thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate, to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really, so i i just bottle it up like i do, everything, not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe, no, no, hm really happy oh, why is that such a difficult question uh, mm i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day, seems like, uh dunking, across the street at the clippers center there's a basketball court there, and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah, mm i have, four close friends that i've known for over uh eight years uh each, and i don't know studious hardworking, determined, mm i don't know, <laughter> yeah <laughter>, mm probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over is uh i don't know i'm pretty content with myself, hmm <sigh>, i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh, uh grade school, i was uh i wasn't the best of students but, i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad, and down, uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sterness i don't think i would've, getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so he's been pretty influential, uh, i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad, and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully, and then his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty, yeah it was it was um <tisk> it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock, that was thousands of pounds didn't work, but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license so it was fun yeah, about that day or in general, mm, other than like the u_c thing like where i didn't apply to the schools in time, i regret that, yeah, hm, i don't know i was i was ten years old ten years ago <laughter> uh i'd probably say to myself, uh <sigh>, i i have no clue, that's that's an interesting question, uh being the first from my immediate college <coll> uh immediate family as in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college, so yes it's it's pretty in, yeah, no problem",1
307,"< slaughter>, um, musk, my family moved to the u s and then i moved down here for college, uh it took me a long time to live here for about a year since i graduated, so there was a lot of ups and downs, but finally it was adapted so it took a while, though, it starts and i have two roommates and there's always a bit of drama here and there between, the girls but for the most part after a year and a few months i think we finally learned how to live together, but it was pretty like a reality t v show for a while, one from college and the other from craigslist., it varies depending on whether we're mad at each other so much, i guess pretty close, right now, we're a little distant., oh over the distance, okay, we haven't seen each other yet, we haven't met in two weeks., because one of them got into this car accident and so she's been distant since then and somehow locked up in her room, and the other one always works late, so we just got our schedule out and no one really tried to hang out with someone, so it's kind of, we're just waiting for someone to take the first step., it's okay, it's getting better., it depends on with whom, i'm, dealing with i think i'd say with some people i don't think with my family very good my friend it's not very good, but with other people i may not know so well, then i am able to control it a little more, but it becomes more passively aggressive than as full of anger, oh, 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch., yeah, that's good., uh probably my best friend nicole, she's probably been best friends for like, god since high school newcomer year is the high school when we first got to know so yeah, um, of, of what, my friend nicole, around we met in french grade beginner year of high school, we were in the same class and then we kind of started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we kind of started hanging out and then we just got closer and since then we've been really close, mhm, um, uh go out with friends go out in bars go dancing cycling hiking, stay active to go to the movies go to eat in restaurants uh photography, um, just hanging out with friends, i guess, whatever, uh, it varies as if i'm really close to them when it comes to things like school work., such types of, things, but when it comes to relationships and friendships and personal things, i'm not really talking to them., so i guess superficially close, but i rely very much on her, so we're close., mhm, that's a good question, i guess it depends on who it is again., i guess people who're ruthless are careless flakey ignorant, and, uh, imagined, yeah, i guess that kind of people, and when people just.., what makes me angry, that's a good question, i guess a lot of things drive me crazy laughter , but it's mostly how people react to different situations can make me angry, i think, yesterday, and it was my friend and we argued because he tried to be healthy and save training and money, and so and so, so by doing what he does, he's ordered pizza in so he doesn't save money and he's not healthy, and so i was frustrated with him because i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and every time he's like i'm going to do it, i'm going to do it so he constantly breaks promises that another thing makes me angry are people who don't follow through, about other people or about me or angry, xx laughter , um, angry i think i'm going with the no i don't feel angry often, get the fuck out of here., that's a tough way to just be paid to be me, i don't know what i'm trying to find out because i quit my full time job because i hated it, that it was usually sitting in an office all day, which i thought was extremely boring., so now i'm working in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself., my dream job, i don't know what it would be, but i know it would involve people and i would like to have a kind of finished product or some kind of performance towards the end, i guess it's something i've realized, i like to see it, the result from all my hard work because i loved in sociology and as much as i did that major is clear to you, it's a whole lot of theorization and argument, but without any real solution, so it's just like in the end all you have is these theoretical elements that you can't really do with and show nothing for your work, except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so, something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography, i love cooking baking in particular so i don't know anything, in this, rich i think, i've been traveling a lot my family is known for trips we've gone to, gosh seven eight different countries i have lived in three or four different countries, i haven't traveled much lately just because i don't tie any money and jobs somehow, but i'd like that, i guess my dream job would be a photographer who would be fantastic for national geographic,, to or a huge photographer who travels, that would be great, but anyway, yes, i travel a lot, in the new places new faces new experiences i become restless very easy, so it is nice to be constantly in motion and, see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just don't get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and worldliness of everyday life so it's beautiful,, stir up things, oh, god, it's all right., i'm trying to think, one of my travels, i think we can talk about it, i don't know it's funny, although i've been one of my most memorable trips in many different countries, one of the trips i made with my family, i was a three week road trip with my family, there are five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon., i know unnecessary to say it's as if you were so close for three weeks camping you always start on the nerves of others, but it was really fun and like when i traveled so many places, i realized that it was like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were around the southwest and the big canyon to zion to the great tetons to yellow stone and it was absolutely amazing to see that all the natural beauty so, um, and we saw a grizzly bear black bear many bison a wolf and it was really cool these kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really surprise me because these things are not man made, and as pretentious as it sounds after a while, europe is somehow not getting old, but it's as if you know that you have the same idea as, white old white men build large buildings and artwork and it's beautiful and everything, but as you just kind of like okay i want to see something that is natural and beautiful, or something that's different, cool, um, quite simple, as long as i, getting healthy no i always sleep so easy, oh grumpy and only very lethargic and little energy say not much and just somehow away in my own world, i don't usually get enough sleep anymore and i've trained more, so it's kind of, excite me, so it's not that bad., that's good., i guess i was more negative right now, but it has to do with such circumstances as uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job, nothing else has found that really found nothing else i'm interested in, so, it's more like ugh, what i'm doing there., yes, it's hard on the market and just like i'm very picky because i don't want to just sit in a little bit of my own cabin because i quit my job just for that reason, so why go back to another job just do the same thing i quit my other job for, so it's exactly how i have to pay for it that i quit my last job to get a better job, so it's kind of like i'm stuck in this section, just like living paycheck to pay, hardly does it and just wait for the right opportunity to come, but it's like, when i give up and sell my soul and go back to the company world of sitting in small cabins, i don't know, yeah, it's hard, but i mean, i think everyone goes through the same situation after college so, but i guess it's hard because many of my friends because i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a girlfriend who teaches english in afghanistan and i have another who has met the president you and one who teaches for america another girlfriend who is in the harvard uh school for how harvard master mass you know to get their masters, so it's kind of like ahh, all this comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so, i do it sometimes, but i'm gonna be hawaii next week, so right now i'm fine laughter , yes, but yeah normally it was kind of like down because, i'm just trying to find what, i should like you to know what i want to do next and how money situations that are very stressful especially if you have school loans to pay the insurance rent car loans as it is just food, as i can not even afford food, so it's just hard to live like this, especially after you've paid as much money as an amazing college education, so it's a little frustrating, but there are a lot of people in the same situation, it's all right., no, i don't think so, but i mean, i think everyone's going through depression here and there, so i don't know if you can, but don't diagnose how medically i'm not on medication, yes, yes, oh, let's see., uh try many different things and don't be afraid to fail, because i'm one of those people, if i'm not going to be the best in something, then i'm just not going to try to accept the best or do anything or go home., so, i think i would have told my high school self that go and try a lot of things, even if it means i'm not the best in it, so, ten years ago, well, that would have made me like twelve, i've done a lot of things i've always done., i think i would have continued to write as much as i was younger. i used to write miniatures like little stories. short stories for my parents., and i kind of stopped doing these things because it's like i'm not good at it, so i'm not gonna do it., and i think if i just keep doing these things and trying to get you to know different classes, i don't know, different sports i kind of grow up with football i don't just know, expand me rather than find something i'm good at and just stick with it, but never really try harder, kind of just like stay i always stayed on a level somehow, but as soon as i'm good, i just stay for good, i'm not trying to go beyond that., if that makes sense, now it's super lame, but i'm looking at t v., laughter , but i have always read one on my time off or just listen to music or just take a nap, or baking, but now it's like i'm standing on my feet all day interacting with people i just want to relax by sitting on the couch and lying and being like i'm done, so, laughter , that's a difficult question., probably the day i was admitted to pomona college., um, i was a newcomer to wellesley college, that's the women's college in the east, and i hated it of how the second of how the first week i knew only that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the whole year, and i just applied to a school to transfer pomona college like that to claremont, and, i didn't think i'd come in and i was because it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like the odds that this is ridiculous, i don't think i'm coming in, and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing, um, but then i got an email from one of the admission consultants i had met when i visited pomona and he was like hi tatiana like, um, i just wanted to see if you had any questions about pomona at the last minute., and i was like why would he email me the day we find out if we know you, accept you or not, except i have the assumption and so sure enough a few hours later i got the email that i was accepted in pomona and i was ecstatic that was like the best day of my life i was so happy, that's probably one., yeah, that's good., it was fantastic, then i took my mother and my little brother for dinner and i went and bought me a few new clothes went and exactly how went crazy colored my hair pierced my nose i was as if we started this whole thing around laughter , yeah, that's good., vulnerable, fun, maybe moody that you never know what you get sometimes.., likely, uh definitely friendly, and quite like a positive person, um, but sometimes maybe a little, aggressive, but, for the most part i think positive things i mean, she's my best friend so laughter , what are you doing?, really happy, oh, when i was in mexico, good over winter, no, i don't know., my friend took me down on a sailing trip, san clemente and that was really funny and we just went like sailing and went around the missions hung on the beach that really fun, this was a good time, yeah, it was cool., laughter see you.",4

similar people i just, i um handle those things better, i do, um i like to believe that it does, i, don't worry as much, um it's just allowed me to, know that actually speaking about the issues, um, relieves me of the tension of um, holding them inside so, that's how it's helped me, at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um, it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring , um if i'm able to um communicate about them with a certain individual, it um relieves me of the stress of, of uh trying to figure out everything alone and often times um by speaking about the issues it um, allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be be better just because i'm hearing myself speak of the issue , um i was diagnosed with depression and um my doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist, um i am, it depends um if i'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do, i often try to plan things and if i'm planning

307,"<laughter>, um moscow, um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college, uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though, it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between, the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while, one's from college

we haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks, 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room, and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of, we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move , it's okay it'll get better, it depends with whom , i'm, dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good, but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger, oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter], yeah, uh probably my best friend nicole, she's probably been we've been best friends for like, god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah, um, of, of what , uh my friend nicole, um we met in french class freshman year of high school, we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then, mhm, um, uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking, staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography, um, just hanging out with friends i guess, whatever, uh, it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um, those kinds of, things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things, i don't really discuss that with them, so i guess superficially close, but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess, mhm, uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again, i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant, and, uh, conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um, what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter], but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess, uh yesterday, and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money , and so and, so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy, and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through, about other people or about myself or angry, xxxx [laughter], um, angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often, dang it, that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me, um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring, so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um, my dream job, i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end, i guess it's something that i realized, i like to see, the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so, something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography, i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something, in that, realm i guess, i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to, gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries, i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that, i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome, um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot, in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and, see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to, stir things up, oh gosh okay um, i'm trying to think, one of my trips, i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is, one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon, i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places, i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so, um, and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made, and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like, white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful, or something that's different too, cool, um, pretty easy as long as i, get well no i always sleep so easy, oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world, i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of , energizing me so no it's not too bad, that's good, uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in, so, it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing, yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for, so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck, barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like, when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know, yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so, but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh, all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so, uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter], yes, but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because, i'm just trying to find like what, i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries, so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation, it's all good, uh no i don't think so but i mean, i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can, but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds, nope, nope, oh let's see, uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail, 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home, so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it, so, ten years ago, well that would've made me like twelve so, [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act, i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories short stories for my parents all the time, and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it, and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes , um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just, expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder, kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good, i don't try to go above that, if that makes any sense, uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v, [laughter], but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap, or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done, so, [laughter], that's a tough question, um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college, um, i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east, and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year, and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont, and um, i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in, and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing , um, but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like, um, just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well, and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not, um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy, that's probably one, yeah, it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter], yeah, bubbly , fun , maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um, probably , uh definitely friendly, um and pretty like a positive person, um, but sometimes maybe a little bit, aggressive but, for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter], huh , really happy, oh when i was in mexico, over winter well, no i don't know, my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in , san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun, that was a good time, yeah it was cool, [laughter] bye",4
427,"yeah sure, i'm good how are you, i'm from florida originally, mhm, where are you from, oh um, for work <laughter>, uh i haven't been back in like a few months, um, i don't know i guess it's like a smaller town than here, it was pretty easy, it's um, it's not that much of a difference except i guess the buildings are bigger <laughter>, um <tisk> i like the weather, and, uh i like the environment of like, hollywood i guess <laughter>, i hate the transportation <transporta> the transportation system, and the traffic it's really bad <laughter>, mhm, yeah i've traveled a lot around america, um i like like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff, and, uh i guess it's just relaxing and it's fun <laughter>, uh well i went to canada once my, mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there, it's pretty cold <laughter>, i didn't like that, about that particular trip, or, um, i don't know she, made us this uh like canadian food, called i think it's poutine or something and, so i guess that <laughter> that was a new experience, um, i try to get out in the sun like go to the beach or something, or read a book, um pretty, okay <laughter>, depends on how bad the situation is, um, i don't know like two days ago, i was arguing with my sister about something, oh yeah <laughter> i really don't remember it something, stupid i think she, i don't know she borrowed something from me and she didn't give it back on time <laughter>, um, i don't know i guess, i mean yeah i wish i just wouldn't lose my temper so quickly, sometimes, but that doesn't happen really often, um, i don't know i guess think more before i talk, then maybe i won't lose my temper <laughter>, um, something i wish i could erase from my memory um, i don't know i guess just, like uh negative people, or something negative people that i've met before, i guess i just wanna erase, the thought of meeting them, um well i, had like friends that were just like, not very good company and, they're just very, not very good influences so, yeah i would just wanna erase meeting them but i'm not friends with them anymore so, um, my, who's a positive influence, my family is a positive influence <laughter>, and my friends now, oh it's pretty good, i, talk to them a lot i see them a lot, so, yeah, mm, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, i don't know <laughter>, i guess um, what i wanted to study in college maybe, it's not that hard but <laughter> it's a little, it's a, big decision, computer science, thanks, yeah a little bit <laughter> not, not as much but a little bit, well i got into it it when <wh> i got into it when i was a teenager so, i guess i just, and i was good at it so i just figured, i'd go on studying it, for higher at a higher level, yeah somewhat but i, uh kinda wanted to, i was kinda trying to make a decision between that and like the arts, so, yeah i'm just happy i did it though, my dream job <laughter>, uh fashion designer <laughter>, yeah, how hard is the job, um, i don't think it's a hard job <laughter> i like clothes and, fabric and, making clothes like that so i don't think it's a hard job actually, i fall asleep like within five minutes, depending on how tired i am, i'm very irritable <laughter> and, uh, yeah i'm very irritable and, not good to be around <laughter> when i'm tired, and i can't focus, i've been feeling good fine, thanks, no, no, no, um, the last time i felt really happy, mm, i guess like, a week or so ago i went to um, i went to, where did i go, i went to this event, downtown, it was like a, art walk thing so it was exciting, thanks, oh it was just like different, art um galleries and stuff downtown, they're just exhibiting their work and, i don't know it was just interesting to walk around and see all that, um, i think i'm, generous, um, patient, i think, i'm a good friend <laughter>, um, i think i'm hard working, and, what else, yeah i, that's that's it i think, um, i wish i was more outgoing, like more sociable person, and, um, what else, i don't know and i wish i was like i guess not um, not easy to um, anger like, get a temper or something, oh no not in trouble it's just, sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people, um getting <get> getting a having a temper, but i've never gotten in trouble or, mm, really badly no, um, i can't <laughter> think of um i guess, i was in, i was in a um <tisk> elevator one time and this person, like was running towards it, and, like like i was trying to hold it for them, but i couldn't reach it in time and they like started cursing me out <laughter> so like i felt really bad 'cause they probably thought i didn't try to open it for them, but, yeah, it was that <laughter>, um, anything i regret <clears throat> not really i well yeah i regret um, not, contacting like old friends that i knew, so i guess yeah maybe i'll do that in the future, i know them from like elementary school, yeah but we lost contact through the years, 'cause i switched schools, for now i mean, oh okay um, i don't know i guess i would just say, um, learn as much as i can and, i don't know just, don't hold back so much, with like um, like not being, outgoing and stuff i guess i'd just tell myself to be, more outgoing <laughter>, um, i think they'd say the same thing i said earlier that i'm generous, patient, hard working, and, what else did i say, um, kind <laughter> i hope they'd say that, mm, i am proud of my intelligence, okay, okay bye, take care",5

329,"yes, pretty good, from new york, uh to go to college well to san diego to go to college and then later to l a, aeronautics and space, to it was i was really good in mathematics and science and i had an interest in airplanes, no, i'm a life coach, uh being a life coach and helping people, i really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that i have made a contribution to their lives., i like the weather, it's great because i like outdoor things and i like doing things by the sea., traffic <laughter> and how crowded it is, yeah, that's good., i like it when i live with my girlfriend and i like it., uh we met on e harmony, very close, around my meditation teacher, around yeah i was very shy and confident and had a lot of fear and i would worry a lot about the future and uh i took courses in meditation and yoga classes and uh it really helped me to be more confident and relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more, uh meditating and doing yoga, let's see what's really crazy., i guess i don't know about crazy i don't get angry that often but frustrated uh i would say how stuck in traffic or around people that mean things to other people for no real reason, um, i usually talk to someone about it when i can, or if i can't, then i usually do meditation or yoga and just try to let it go., i can control my temper well., um with my girlfriend and it was about um she was driving on the highway and uh i suggested that they come by because there were some road workers on the side and she refused to do that and stayed on the right track, so we argued a little bit about it., it felt as if she wasn't listening to me and almost as if she was deliberately not doing what i suggested to be defiant., yes, to rollerblade kayak uh sing i sing in a choir, to travel to india and nepal for six weeks, yes, as much as i can <laughter>, i love to explore i have loved to explore since i was a little child and so i love to see new things and discover things about new cultures and i love backpacking in the wilderness and you know to explore nature, cool around well i went on a trip to india and nepal it's my first time ever there at first week and a half i was with a large group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat and went white water rafting on the ganga river and then i went on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking in nepal uh with a guide there and uh it was just really nice around in the anapurna area and then i went to uh back in india and researched the area near tibet and then uh went to uh rajasthan and uh tiger park in madhya pradesh and was like really, i was contacted by a friend of mine and said they were on this trip and i always wanted to go to india, so i decided to do it., yeah, it was really funny, around caring and uh enthusiastic for life, no, i don't sleep as well as i did when i was younger, but for the most part i sleep well from time to time i will wake up, you know, like four in the morning or five in the morning when i want to sleep up to seven and not be able to sleep again, but in general it's pretty good, uh i feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes want a nap you know in the afternoon, yes, 10 or 20 years ago, i guess i wish i had invested money or bought something like a house or something when i was younger, which would probably be the advice i'd give myself., i'm sensitive to other people to be positive and some kind of have a positive perspective on life to be very determined when i'm doing something, uh i'll figure out how to do it, even if it's difficult to i'm very creative in looking for creative ways to do things i guess the strongest thing is probably that i'm pretty well balanced i'm very organized, but i'm also pretty creative around pretty balanced that, around pretty close uh much closer than i was when i was younger uh and although i would say i'm probably closer to friends and people who are in a spiritual community with me than i am able to get to my family, uh outdoors in nature and training, and also sing, around the fact that i went with followed my heart and did what i wanted to do against gong with what i think i should do, i guess yesterday i was spent the day on the beach and just uh bike and went skating and visited some old friends there, i felt very relaxed and uh animated and uh uh i also felt like i missed living on the beach because i really lived near the beach, so i guess i was a little sad that i didn't live there anymore, but i was really happy to be there., goodbye.",1
446,"<synch>, yes, i'm wonderful how are you, california, mhm yes, the weather is one of 'em, uh the food, um, and the way uh everything is centrally located, mhm, the traffic, the smog, and um, it's just gotten really really overcrowded, um i wouldn't say a lot but i do try to um, travel um, at least, once once or twice every two years, um, just exploring different things and being able to um, have different experiences um, things of that nature and you know, learning new things and um, just different cultures uh i like to um learn about different cultures and when you travel, um you get a sense of, um, you know feedback from different cultures and different areas so i like that, um well i just came from miami uh last year i went to miami for a week and a half, and it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going, um and um the weather was wonderful the people are really nice, and um it was really a great experience i went out there for um, a particular event um they have um something every year um where everyone comes out from all over, and uh you just kinda party and hang out and meet new people it was really fun, um, well from that trip i would say um, swimming in the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, um miami beach waters was wonderful, yeah it was, um child development, mhm, well um, i've always been interested in children um since i was younger, um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age, and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do, um so, uh that's when i um looked into child development courses, and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy <en> enjoy doing so, um i started taking classes and um the rest is history, i am yes it's been um, fifteen years in august, yeah, my dream job, i would say um, to become a principal, well it's something that um i've thought about doing for a while now and um, i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going, so um i'm gonna be back in school and i'm gonna be taking courses, um so that i can make that happen, because it is a dream of mine yeah thank you, um it's gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me, and um you know it's definitely gonna be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine, so it's something that i'm willing to, i'm willing to do, um, a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um, and and outgoing as well um, but i think a little bit of both i would say, <laughter>, uh i meditate, i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating, i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time, oh wow i'm very very good at that, very good at controlling my temper i um, again um, a series of, meditation that i do um, it involves deep breathing and um, just really centering yourself, to where you can feel your heart beat and you can, um really feel everything in your body, and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger, and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot, oh wow, it was just recently um actually unfortunately, it was last week and it was with my husband, and um, it was about um, just the way he responds sometimes to me, uh it can be a little aggressive, um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression, i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so, yeah that was it, i felt, very frustrated, um and i actually felt angered too um, but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so, it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time, uh <sigh>, a situation which i wish i would've handled differently, honestly i haven't had a situation like that in, in years i've pretty much kind of, um, you know kind of mastered, my responses um, to certain um, stimuli, i've kinda got that down, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage, um mother, i was pregnant at sixteen and, um i had um, a lot of pressure from family to um, give my child up for adoption or to, um abort, and i chose life so that was, that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old, teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager, or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so, that i think was the hardest decision, i had to make, um, well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later, and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by, not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life, pro-choice pro-life and um, eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and, i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom, i do yeah, um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties, um just as anything, um, but at the end of the day it is really rewarding, um, and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised, become a productive citizen and go out into society and, just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is, oh wow, so many ways um, the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um, accept his feedback even if i don't like it, and i um allow him to express his self, fortunately unfortunately when i was little um, there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child, um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it, um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self, i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age, and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um, make sure that you nurture that um because that's, kind of um, the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so, i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite, thank you, um <sigh>, well, it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up, so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that, it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away, and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so, it varies, i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um, i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but, other than that i i've been feeling really good, no i haven't, no i have not, you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up, i'm happy because, that is a chance for me to, take advantage carpe diem seize the day, so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because, i realize that some people did not wake up, some people are homeless some people, are going through so many situations that are really disheartening, and that's not me so, i feel really really blessed, every day, thank you, um as um, nurturing patient loving, friendly, um, kind of reserved, um, well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree, and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable, in certain subjects, and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things, and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert, you know what no regrets no regrets um, you live and learn um nothing is perfect, um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today, so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today, oh <sigh> man to stay

356,"yes , okay , from here from eh from alhambra , uh the weather's really nice and everything's very familiar , uh sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads too too much traffic , i i studied art and photography, uh it it wasn't so much a decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it , yes , i'm a photographer , mhm, oh, i suppose uh , um, running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business , uh no not no i'm an also an apartment manager it keeps me tied down , um it's uh fair it's not the greatest because of being an apartment manager, i've i do have free rent but i have to stay, there a lot, so , that part does the free rent part is very good , oh gosh, my most memorable experience, that's hard to say , um , well, i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences , oh, well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school, there was a few of the things that i was happy about, and, some art pieces i've made were memorable, and , some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though , uh , well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family, uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a, uh there's a few that are from far <f>, distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and , my other brother lives in maui <clears throat> , mhm, oh mostly very talented, <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was, or am and they're um, i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up, just seems like they were all hooked into social media , uh go on a walk or, watch television , or play with my computer , and uh, um well , there's some <so> some, uh , there's some kind of uh , injustices that happen in not, not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking, eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna , uh make any exceptions or change some rules , and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups>, uh that are upsetting, uh yeah, i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site , the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside , and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside, um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained, that we were late setting up when it when they told us, to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and , and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so, uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job , that's yeah that's how they do things, so that that is upsetting , uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are, that might be better, um , yeah , uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually , might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but later i might um vent or something like that, but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that , um, well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we, we were arguing where to go first , and um so we compromised and, did most of her things and one of my things then after , this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so, but it, yeah , no, post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is , uh, no i have not, yes , oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty, yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty, yeah , um, well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist , um, well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house , um i was waking up at, noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um, focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough, uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression , yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was , no, uh well, eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that , he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh, and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on, with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days , um, i think therapy makes you see what the um , like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really, you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of, try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately , or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint, and i try to look for clues about that , i think i'm um, slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods, i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for, for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important, it um, it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and, deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed , uh , well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are, probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i, have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um, um, soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with , mm, you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and , the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and, eh things like that or um, some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that , where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that , oh you mean in life in general yeah well, i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa>, uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well, and um didn't really, i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have, um , i think it would've been to um , at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some, uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics, i had i was an art major and i had no car so , a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and, and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to , do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time, so , um , well i'm i've been told i'm very patient , and also i have um some original original artistic ideas , so , um those are, those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um , you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them , so, yeah , um let's see , really enjoyed was i had a , i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing um a soccer game recently , i really enjoyed that so , mhm, okay , it was my pleasure , thank you goodbye",10
457,"<synch>, yes, spectacular, this is an interesting experiment, <laughter>, uh i'm from middle of nowhere iowa, <sigh> uh, may second of two thousand seven, so exactly five years six years ago, um, infrequently like once every couple years, uh the weather exists so it's more extreme, and then it's, rather less, exciting, a lot less colorful, uh winter in minnesota <laughter>, uh it took approximately, the drive in that's that's about all it took the lights uh, the lights took care of the rest, uh, i really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime so that bycicles uh, have free rein of the streets i like all the art i love, the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here, oh you know, the traffic <sigh>, the exceedingly high cost of living, uh, yeah those are those are my big beefs, uh not nearly as much as i would like to, i've done a little bit, uh i like not, knowing exactly how things are gonna go i like the fact that it forces me to, uh deal with people to, deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to, uh, last year i got to, hang out in san marcos for a little bit, after i split up with my ex, and then, after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles, <laughter>, uh, last week, managed to go on a bike ride for cyclavia, , as a <laughter> he was basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made he made a bunch of like, national news and, he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group, riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didn't, bat an eye we didn't blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday, but, our group of friends, is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else, <laughter>, i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles, um, <clears throat>, once i found the right group of friends, it was easy to be social it it, drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing, bombastic for the first time and it stuck, um, if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out, i i do all sorts of stuff, it um, usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project, uh what temper <laughter>, uh, , um, <laughter> panicked 'cause i really wanted to make him not hate me, and i mostly failed, uh, hard on him, i mostly uh mostly got by with, a couple of scrapes on my ego, uh, when , when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of, having my <sigh>, verbal gloves up i managed to, take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was, not my most graceful moment, uh, i feel guilty about lots of stuff um, i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else, 'cause i really love junk food it's really good i have very little food willpower 'cause i used to be a fat guy, i'm not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was, uh made a lot of hard decisions, i guess <sigh>, it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff, but, it wasn't even that hard 'cause it pushed me to do it so, it's a tricky question madam, uh oh you know broken collarbone, severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time, <laughter>, mm, no, my memories are important, i have lived a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe i like this universe, <laughter>, uh, my little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me, uh, my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy, uh, but, since most of the rest of them live so far away don't really have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparce, uh, jackrabbit's been a pretty positive influence on me lately, she is a magical creature, uh, well there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful, there's the part where she, manages to, hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she, actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part, where, she is a hundred percent kind and caring, all the time, all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that, she does this all, without wanting anything in return, i don't know that's, <sigh> smitten <laughter>, uh, <laughter> what a funny question how do i know them as though she's multiple people how did you know, uh, i know her through my, bicycle friends <sigh>, uh, the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland i'm pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits, so, i i get to sleep, poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter, <deep breath> less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life, uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire, um mm, because, the universe, in its, infinite, uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor, uh has managed to convince me of the, reality, of magic, in the arthur c clark sense, uh so, as a fortunate and <cough>, vaguely aware being, eh it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this, uh, yeah, uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate, and i'm feeling more and more inspired all the time, if i could just work on the motivation i'd be set, mm not since you asked me on the form a little while ago no, uh no i used to think i had it but who knows at this point that was awhile ago, uh, i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and, started having fun mm and then that's uh yeah the rest is ancient history, um, twenty thirteen <laughter>, uh, <sigh> working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling uh, an art project that all my friends, helped and put on that's that was really nice it's a nice feeling, <laughter>, <sigh>, that's a very good question i'm not actually sure i'll ask him later today though, um, i guess i'm, enthusiastic, i am, thesauric, and i am, <sigh>, i'm gonna have to say, highly analytical <laughter>, uh, it'd be nice if i could get my super powers back that'd be pretty cool, uh, like turning on some of the fancier, finely tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself, <laughter>, uh, that's a really tough one, i think the thing that i'm most proud of, would probably be, <sigh>, you know i'm not actually sure, <laughter>, oh all sorts of stuff but i'm working on that, <clears throat>, <deep breath>, don't masturbate so much <laughter>, uh jackrabbit, really bad puns uh and dessert, <laughter>, no problem, bye ellie",3

the journeys i was on, to me, i used to, i've always done yoga., i've always meditated., i used to train, and i've always done it., i've done a lot of things lately, but i find it hard to relax, i don't have the same., the same outlets i made before, the same uh, i don't follow her so much anymore, i guess i'm, i've lost my motivation or something i'm depressed about, you know, i guess that's where it's right there., um, pretty good, i'm so spirited, to the point of uh, uh physicality, i never know that around, but i'm standing on my floor and.., but i can control my temperament i never lose control really, around <sigh> last time, probably., um, as late as you know, last month or so i may have argued with around, uh an acquaintance about uh, uh, i don't know that i have to come back to this question., no, no, yes, um , well officially october of last year, but i think i'm longer depressed than that, but officially october of last year, um , actually i was treated uh for other medical problems and, um, my depression was so remarkable for the doctors, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., um , well, i've never been suicidal, but just to just in i i've just often thought about, eh, that i don't have much reason to live i thought i had a purpose and stuff, but, i don't have anyone in my life., who i think takes care of me enough uh, that i was really <rea> when i was even dead, uh so, i kind of lost myself., and around that was once enough, that i was around enough to uh, you know you have purpuse in my life, but.., i've lost some of it., motivation <motiv> yeah, well, i'm trying to pull it together, i'm trying to, <sigh> get a feeling back from me, i get inspired again and again, but overall i don't seem to make much progress., yeah, that's good., i wouldn't really call it therapy, i don't have a therapist per se, i have a therapist., a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me, and no one really talk about psychosocial questions, for the, uh huh , did you say it was annoying?, eh , all right., and yes., to overwhelmed busy around, i'm just trying to stay alive and watch over everything., no, uh , it's easy if i can't., yeah, if i have a chance to fall asleep, i don't have a problem with that., more, distracted and.., more, uh lousy i guess the word is, whatever, uh if i had a best friend around <sigh>, i don't know about <sigh>, he may have many positive adjectives before, but now only you know, just uh, some people say i should be proud because i survive a hard time or some people think that uh, i'm a loser., <laughter> like this, um, i don't know, maybe around, a survivor, uh persistently, well, i've always been proud of my career and, i give back people who give back to society because i was given., it felt like around <sigh>, so i'm just proud of uh, i don't have much pride anymore, to be honest., i don't know., <laughter> psychology, and, good at first, um not really in itself, although my current career includes a lot of uh, psychology a lot of, i don't know what i'm saying., it's a part of it, but it's not the center of it., well, i guess if my career still goes, i'm in care, but.., i've been sick lately and with depression and other health problems i, uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income, and i start the process because i don't work, very, i mean, i had my dream jobs., i had my dream jobs that i didn't have., i don't know what the future will be like, uh, work, but, um.., something i suppose to work with people again, health uh help in any way, um, no, but lately with the depression more often, i've always said that i've never regretted anything because i'd make the best decision for all things ahead of me, but.., i just wish there were times when.., the decisions i would have been, < slaughter>, were better because some decisions i apparently made or were made for me made my world somehow fucked up, for lack of a better word shit, what i don't understand, <sigh>, to be strong to believe in myself, to remember that i've survived a lot of things, and i'm going to survive that too, to get up and move me, to < sigh>, to have confidence, faith, to <sigh>, i just kicked my ass with murphy's law, as much as you know, i just uh, it seems like i've been trying to make my world better, i'm getting depressed again and again., so, it's almost like i'm, i don't want to give up, but every time i try to move forward, i get knocked back and it gets exhausting, and i have no support system really no one, not really, <sigh>, um , loyal, um, working hard, um , reliable, um , be able to , well, at least i used to be, uh , intelligent, contemplative around eh uh, deep, not a superficial person around, yeah, i guess that's some of them., many years ago, i used to have a lot of trust., pretty dynamic person i used to be people, said <wou> <s> used to say that i was the centered person they knew, and i used to, people help and i'm in their shoes

and entertainment venues and travel, go to dinner with friends doing things around, but lately i don't really have any persecutions, a good day a happy day a funny day for me is a day without anything

409,"all right., mm, all right., safe, mm, i'm fine., i'm from uh l a, yeah, that's good., i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment, yeah, that's good., uh, it's pretty much the same year around as well as actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get all four seasons, so it's kind of like a mixed bag, and, i guess i'm kind of used to it by now, so it would be kind of nice to explore other areas., i've lived here all my life because i've made too much travel, so uh, it's a bit of a ruttiness., but overall, it's okay., well, i've taken computer programming into operations, but that goes back to the seventies, so the technology has changed a lot, as one can say <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>, that's why it was my major, yeah., um, i don't know that it's kind of curious that you have to use your mind., it was as if you knew brand new something that you know very new, back in the, in the old times that one knows in the seventies, now it's all for computers, but then it was kind of like < sniff> something very unique around, you didn't see you know too many computers back then., and around i worked in programming so that i somehow put into the logic of it you know compilation together, you know to solve a, a special to know problem you come up with step by step solutions on i think all kind of back then i was somehow more into the, the analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> i can't say this word now <laughter> the analytical properties of the, the problem, mhm, uh, no, i kind of turned off, i'm still using computers, but i haven't got yet, i wasn't in programming for a long time, well, i kind of got into another area, kind of a distraction., uh turnoff <divorcion> to turn off to another area in my life, uh that goes back to the.., the late seventies i somehow took a different turn and then, when i somehow came back into it, it was, i kind of got into another field, so i never really followed it., up to the degree i wanted, wow that's a good question <laughter> i've never thought about it uh, well actually kind of ironic <i> ironic actually something was pretty simple at this time, so maybe that's why i'm a little depressed and then.., at this point i wanted to somehow just do some kind of a beautiful relaxing, job but i want something of a challenge, but i don't want to do too much, too much thinking, that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the old days you know, i just want a nice comfortable relaxing work that i can feel, fulfillment, but i don't want to, too tense of a situation that i am somehow in the place in my life where i just want a nice, relaxing work, yes <laughter>, yeah, that's good., oh, i'd say, good for most shy, but sometimes when i go i could be going out, um, but.., i speak in general, i'm shy to start with and then sometimes i can loosen somehow and be more, singing and sometimes i can take it to the extreme where i talk too much, as once the funny gates open them kind, open up too much, so i have to turn my back on you., but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as a general behavior, oh, really., yes <laughter>, oh, uh,, well, i listen to music around, i'll take a good look around., i'm gonna.., what do i do to relax?, well i just try to avoid stressful situations like somehow i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends, i'll be in an area, all around, type of comfort area where i, i feel safe i can only, dialogue with people so somehow brings me out of my, think of my own, problems i have somehow i just know you focus, about being at the moment with my, well known <acqu> friends and acquaintances, i'm pretty good, i don't really have a temperament problem., it takes a lot to get me to explode uh, i think when i was younger, i was a little bit more, had a little light temperament i never had a really bad temperament but uh, uh temper isn't really a problem i have, i tend to be quite gentle easy to walk, yeah, that's good., wow, that's a good question., um, i'm not sure to be honest., i would have to think about it, to be honest for a long time <laughter>, i can't come up with an answer to that., it's not really part of my repertoire, nothing comes to my mind from above on my head, all right., um, well, the only thing i can imagine and somehow go back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments, back about ten years ago, i was more around, i'm trying to think about what word i'm looking for for more people's trust, how uh people and how uh <tisk> i thought were experts in their field, and, i inherited some money, i was a little careless about it., and i just had a mood that you know.. nothing would go wrong, kind of a little bit of naivety <nait> nativity, and unfortunately i've done something bad, financial decisions that somehow make me into a bad, position for the rest of my life, unfortunately, because of a medical condition i have, it's hard for me to recover and you know, make it all out, so i'd say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions, that i really regret, wow, hmm, that's a tough one., i can't think of anything from my head <laughter>, all right., oh, well, uh, i don't really have too much family left, the only one i have is my.., it's just me and my uncle., and we communicate <c> we communicate regularly around, he lives <li> but he lives in clear water florida, so we're all right., but.., he's like eight, he's in the eighties, and obviously i'm in the fifties, so.., we're doing we kind of have a little conversation he's kind of worried about my well being, but it's kind of flat on a flat level it's not us getting really deep, and he has his own problems., so that we don't really get into too deep a conversation, and different from him it's really there's not really someone else i have, so it probably depressed me a little because i don't really feel, i have someone i can really count on or trust., i don't know why, but i have a medical condition, so i think that might be part of the problem., and, i've been, a little b p a, so i have to get up to go to the toilet., and, to answer your question <laughter> to a, long story short <laughter>, um, it's difficult to sleep a good night i usually wake up uh feeling a little tired, or pain, so it's difficult, uh.., well, i feel okay, i mean.., i felt kind of tempered.., i'm trying to solve problems i don't have., responsibilities assumed for, but.., i feel a little calm as of late, no, well, i said yes when i filled out the questionnaire and, i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with taking a uh, i think it's m m p h, the multifaceted minnesota, personality something of whether or not, that goes back about six months ago, they asked me questions about my memory, but then they also got questions about my, my well being also psychologically and i think some of the, the answers said that they, guess that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, i didn't follow that., and that's because.., of philosophical differences, but i think i have one you know., a mild case of depression, well, you know.., as i said, i'm just kind of like a way to go in life i'm uh, i'm fine, but i know that i, life is passing, so i haven't really fulfilled my life., my goals, you know, i'm kind of alone, i'd like to have a girlfriend, i don't have a girlfriend, so that's someone i feel like i can get closer., and i'm not really i'm kind of in a transition time in my life now so uh, there's a little uncertainty, i've got some you know, some kind of financial uncertainty, so, um.., you know i'm not as good as i'd like to., wow, that's a good <laughter>, really happy to, let me think about it a minute, well, it wasn't so long ago that i was actually dealing with <makes sound with mouth>, okay, i know you can really come up with an answer, i helped a lady she was at a fair., it was home it was a natural product expo so it was pretty nice we uh, we had some nice meals afterwards there were a lot of exhibitors, give away really nice samples, it was in anaheim, so somehow i got a chance to get away from l a, and, you know some interesting people met who were very extraordinary, they were willing to like, let me experience your products or services, and, i was near people who, i work with whom i have to socialize with so much, i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh, about a month ago, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's it., best friend, i don't know if i really have a best friend, but uh, i'd say.., hmm, i don't technically know that i really don't have a best friend, so it's really hard for me to answer that, so uh, i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>, um, i like to be conscientious, you know, i have mistakes and everyone, but i think, overall,, i'm conscientious i'm trying to be honest for the most part on the most important questions i may know, say little white lies or you know,, i'm not perfect on it, but when it comes to the serious stuff, i tend to be pretty honest and i'm a tough worker i got <g> good work ethics, um, i tend to, pretty quiet for the most part, um, what do i regret?, well you may have that <laughter>, um, um.., i'm just good, just total, i regret uh, a little more persuasive in in my previous, uh previous life uh, and somehow put me in this position, it's kind of due to my financial decisions that were kind of like my albatross in my life., i made some bad decisions and unfortunately, i have to pay the price for now somehow, so i like, something like, living a kind of pauper existence at the moment that is somehow a kind of depressing, so i'd say that's probably what i regret the most, well, i'd say to really know you're somehow going to analyze with what you really feel around, i think, i gave advice to other people with the opinion of other people, i was kind of gone from, my basic, being that you know how i really felt, like for example i would do aggressive, uh invest that, if it turned out it would have been like a way of winning the lottery i would have been, good for the rest of my life <laughter>, but unfortunately it went in the opposite way, too many eggs in this basket, so i kind of regretted going with you, my gut feeling and let other people influence me, and uh, because by nature i'm a conservative person, so i really should make more concervative investments, in other areas of my life i tend to be more conservative, but somehow i did some, aggressive financial decisions, so that's pretty much, somehow it always goes back to this area as far as i regret, yeah, that's good., wow, that's interesting, i did a lot on the weekend, so <laughter>, <laughter> good, i like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i really can, you know, making money, it's kind of like my bread and butter time, 'cause i do fairs., but if i don't, i might like to look at a few., you know i'd like to, go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game, go to the movies., going out with a few friends, so i would just, or you know, just step back a little bit, but my primary primary focus would be on, you know, earn money on the weekends, uh, that's interesting., proud of, um, i would say that i was living a healthy life by and large i would say i have never been in any kind of really, bad, bad uh, motor vehicles, um, you know, i, i lived a pretty healthy, healthy life, i'd say that would probably, i don't know if it's really proud., but as far as i was concerned, the course remained as far as, no really deep <laughter> alley to go down, so to speak, all right., it's my pleasure., goodbye., nan",10

you are and experiece <ex> have new experiences, and the great thing about it too is when you return home, it kinda helps you reset your, it kinda makes <ma> appreciate <appreci> makes you appreciate, coming home as well, well <laughter>, you know i've been to spain and, um, england and italy different uh, different places, <laughter>, probably, barcelona loved barcelona, the architecture and the, the food <f> well food was uh, was a part of it but just the the, my experiences there were, fantastic, art history, <sigh> i was always good artistically so, it seemed a natural probably should've studied graphic design which i later got into, to be, um, the star of my own t_v show, <laughter>, <laughter> i would be the most hilarious comedian, making the entire country laugh at my brilliant

<laughter>, <sigh>, try to take a peaceful walk, do yoga, much better i used to be i think when i was younger not so good, lately i'm actually very proud of it, i think the only time i really argue is on the phone with time warner cable <laughter>, i don't know it's been awhile, mm, maybe not working hard enough some days um, when you're a freelancer it's hard to keep at yourself to, consistently be productive, <laughter>, um, <whispering to himself> handled differently, well, <sigh>, i don't know um, can we come back to that one i can't think right now, uh, <whispering to himself> hardest i've ever had to make, uh probably, once when i moved back to los angeles from boston, and, i had a girlfriend at the time and, it was hard to leave i knew i had to had to come back but it, i think it, mm that particular move west, was, um, felt it was calling me, and that's where my connections were and i had to come home <sniffle>, i think so yes <laughter>, um, erase from my memory, <sigh> i don't know <kn> gosh i mean, i don't know, <ss> something you feel guilty about <ab> um, maybe you know <laughter>, uh, maybe doing something when you're a little, you've had a couple of extra drinks and, you made out with a girl <laughter> that you shouldn't have, eh, uh, it's pretty good, i think um they're a challenge, they're my folks are together got a sister my sister's in new york not the tightest family but, you know, eh, i'm i'm proud <prou> i'm uh, grateful for everything that, i've derived from it, i have a best friend that i went to college with, and he's very smart i consistently, call him uh when i'm having uh challenges life challenges, um i will consistently call this specific <sp> well a few specific friends, to get advice and i like <li> i like that i have a couple of friends who have been tremendously influential and, supportive friends are, good friends are very important, sometimes, uh most of the time, not horrible but not amazing <ama> i mean, it's okay, <laughter>, uh, dragging tired <ti> uh, not motivated or um yeah, pretty good, pretty good, i'd say <s>, um, no i mean they're i think they're consistent with the way i've been for a while, <sniffle>, no, no, <deep breath> <sigh> i think when i get consistent work when i get a lot of do a lot of creative stuff get a lot done creatively, uh i guess, <laughter> i would hope something like, um, you know, a charismatic, fun loyal guy <laughter>, um, <ss> i wish, i were more, um more <m> more aggressive more consistent with, um, pursuing dreams i do a lot i do enough sometimes i get down on myself for not trying harder, to do all the artistic things i love to do, um, well recently <laughter>, recently i signaled, into a lane, <laughter> this woman, was shouting at me i could hear it 'cause our windows were open it was a hot summer day, and then, later, i drove up beside her and i said in a pleasant way i said i was just trying to signal, to get into your lane, 'cause she was, cursing at me through the window prior to that, and she lifted up her finger <f> just lifted up her finger <laughter> and gave me the finger and it was just, it's funny sometimes you try to approach someone, in just a normal, loving way and all they have for you is hate and that did make me feel bad <laughter>, <laughter>, a little angry, no, 'cause i took the high road <laughter> but she <laughter> regrets i'm sure, um, just go out with friends make dinner, recently a bunch of i had a you know small party at my house and, one guy cooked food and we had a bunch of friends over and, that's always fun, um, let's see, never get too, up or too down too high don't, um accentuate the highs and lows, because there's always a different it's a roller <roller> endless rollercoaster so you need to be prepared for the for that long ride, creative things, the creative the performances the comedic performances the, commercials i've done the acting the stand-up comedy the, graphic design all my creative filmmaking all my creative outlets that, that are an expression of me, buh bye, <laughter>",1
395,"yes, i'm fine., california here in los engles, mhm, to i love to be near the beach to i love the beach, i love living in a big city., um, and i love the fact that i have many friends and family here, mm transport, um, only so many sometimes too many people, but apart from that, i'm generally happy here, photography and linguistics, mhm, i love photography, i was always interested in it and i also studied it in high school, so i wanted to learn more about it, and with languages i come from a mixed background, so i wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic origin, it wasn't hard, it was a passion, so i enjoyed it., i'm not no., to make photography full time and also do some of the things i'm passionate about creative creative things, i have an idea i would like to make a few < s> some robe < r> ah like a robe line around women robes and things like this, mhm, i have already traveled a bit and i enjoy <en> i love traveling, to see different cultures different countries around, meeting new people, all this, and the language, i lived in greece for around <tisk>, over a year i taught english there and around <sniffle> i moved around to different parts of greece and uh really had a great time, i think.., only with my group of friends i met there and go through with the experience with them, i think one of my most memorable experiences was making elafonisos with everyone in a car and spending a fantastic time., yeah, that's it., i think i'm shy to start with and to start and when i meet people, then i'm much more outgoing, photography and linguistics, , rest in the bed, watching a movie in bed, this is probably one of the things i like to do to relax, i think very good <laughter>, it was probably with my friend.., uh with regard to money questions, i must feel guilty because i don't generate as much income as i need now., i just have a few fights in my career., and financially it will be very difficult, yes, it was difficult, but i have worked very hard to fix that <sigh>, all right, i'm here and i'm doing this focus study that i'm doing to generate a lot of things to make more money that works harder but looks for other ways to generate money outside my career., um, probably raped, no, no, sometimes, not that i know of., , i felt like i was., <deep breath> felt stressed and worried, i don't seem to have a problem with that <laughter> i seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night, mhm, around grumpy and and lethargic and around in the morning, i wish i were going around differently., um, i really can't imagine anyone right now., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, it was probably to decide not to have a child, well, i was pregnant and.., was not sure if i should continue the pregancy around, and that was also due to financial burden and, the father with whom i was involved did not want the child, so i made this very difficult decision, hmm, i know when i went around cancun to go on a holiday around the new year around new year period new year holiday, i felt absolutely fantastic i felt happy i felt relaxed around, i felt as if i had no worry in the world temporarily, um, eh free, i wish i could.., be a little stronger and more confident, definitely more confident, i'd say i'm a wonderful friend., um, if i love someone you know, i love her very much family of friends., friend, so i think it's good that i'm very loyal as a friend., i'm honest, i'm taking care of people., um, i'm fun to be with, so i think these are some of my best qualities, <deep breath> about my relationship with my family around my father is not so great, my parents were divorced when i was young, and he was somehow in and out of my life you know forever., mostly from, so that's not fantastic, but it's something i'm used to, so it's not, as painful as it would have been if he had been there and then i lost him, but it's still.., it's still not the best situation, i mean, i still wish this could be fixed somehow, , so there are good and bad relationships in my family, , someone who's been there for me since i was very young, and was always incredible and i love her so much, <deep breath> ten or twenty years ago, i would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun, so i don't have to work so hard now, i am very sorry that i regret not taking my career seriously earlier, because now it's.., it was much harder., um, i think it took the kids to the pier and spent a wonderful time with them, and make her happy, this was probably a great time at one of the best times in the last weeks, , and uh, and they're great kids., no, i think they're a challenge., it's harder because they're stepchildren, so there's some.., times when i don't know exactly how much to be involved and how much to not be involved, but i'm very happy because they're really good kids, they tend to fight a lot, but.., but i, but it's not as difficult as i think some other parents have it, mhm, to make it a conscious effort, not to, <laughter> not to punish her or to overstretch her, i make a conscious decision not to yell at her as i was screamed, i was often screamed as a child., and it was really it was really difficult, so make sure i don't do that, i think i'm very proud of the fact that i was able to, traveling to the world around, and live in other places many other places around the country and around the world, and, the fact that i have learned several languages, um, and the fact that i am able to keep, really long long relationships with my friends, thank you., goodbye.",7
459,", hello., yeah, that's good., i'm fine, a little tired., uh i live in culver city around but originally i was raised in venice, around the beach, quick drivers, i don't really like the city i lived in utah, anything but the city, um, i don't know many people who live here anymore., uh transport, it's too big., but it's at home., < slaughter>, i've been out of the country a few times., i see new <n> <free throat>, see new places, when i was 14, i went to costarica to visit my father., and i was there for two weeks and that was the last time i've been there, in costa rica, um, seeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker, for joy i was happy excited somehow scared, it wasn't my decision, it was my mother's., she had planned the trip., yeah, that's good., uh, i wanted to be an art major, but, i didn't understand why i was in math classes among other classes and i thought i was wasting my time, so i decided i really didn't want to do that., so i moved back to l a., i don't really have a dream job uh i, but wants to be self employed, right now i'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer, but i'm not really sure, i'm very reserved, but the people i know i'm much more open and talkative, < slaughter>, um, to relax, i, walk on walks i walk my dog a lot, i'll call my girlfriend if i want to calm down., i also do uh, meditation, and self hypnosis, i'm trying., it, depends on, what <wha> how i feel, or how excited i am or how calm i try to be, if i'm really upset, it's much harder for me to calm down and, bring me down through meditation or self hypnosis, but, yeah, that's good., um, sometimes i lose it., i scream when i lose my temper and, i've put holes in the walls, not, not yet <sigh>, last night, my mother and i had a fight., it was, about me buying a, ticket last night for a greyhound, to go to utah, i go up there to work a few weeks and make some money and i had to buy my ticket a week in advance and i didn't want to do it last night., this situation last night, i wish i hadn't blown up, or, got as angry as i can about the situation because it escalated, my little sister, with whom i am very close, she is 15 years old and will be sixteen in a few days., i would do anything for her, she's the world for me, my mother, we fight, we push each other's buttons, i think she sees me as my father, she thinks that i, will succeed with nothing, sad, it's okay., um, i wish,, i could forget most of my high school years or my sophomore year, i didn't like high school or my second year., i, uh, become sober and, i'm leaving., i don't know what to say., drug withdrawal therapy, um, when i was sixteen, i got, i just started taking some other drugs and, it came out of hand, i guess, and, my mom wanted to help me and i didn't want the help, so i kept going to different places and run away and not, i wanted to be in those places, so i finally agreed to go to utah and try to get sober, , um, he's my best friend, my whole life since i can remember and we grew up together., he took drugs with me and has been sober for more than a year., almost impossible, i don't have to sleep the night before to get a few hours., or i don't sleep well, i'm against pills., and i stopped smoking marijuana and now i just don't sleep, or were not , last weeks, yeah, it's not fun., i lay in bed until i finally fell asleep in the early morning., or i see t v until late at night or netflix, i'm tired, i'm groggy., i'm much more likely for my anger is much more likely to get out, i was fine this weekend is better than most my girlfriend has stayed in my house all weekend so, i was happy., um, < deep breath> < sigh>, i don't know., i'm not so irritable, no, but, yes, i was probably, i was i think i was 12 the first time i was diagnosed i was diagnosed multiple times though, um, last time less than a year ago, uh my mom was looking for help for me she saw that i was unhappy and she was worried, no, uh i held first in june when i finished my uh drug rehab program, in utah, of the last year, i'm learned coping skills, so i'm able to.., calm down when, i'm angry easier i know how to stay away from my trigger points and getting away from staying away from angry, or become depressed, it may be, when the person is ready to change, and want it, two days ago, it was because i was with my girlfriend that we had a moment., and so i was just overwhelmed by the happiness i think i, < slaughter>, trusted, um, funny, shit, i don't know., outgoing smart athletic he would, yeah, that's good., i wish i wasn't i would've melted so short i, i wish i wasn't depressed, i wish i didn't feel like i needed something to help me sleep., i wish i was totally dependent on myself., um, when i was younger, my father would uh, he hit my dog in front of me once because he was mad at me., so he started hitting the dog and i don't know, that was probably the biggest thing i was little i just remember being sad, yeah, that's good., everyone has something to regret, <deep breath> <sigh> so as not to be so naive, hmm, uh, i went to hypnosis., i had a, an appointment for hypnosis a few days ago, it was really relaxing really soothing and i feel like it could help me, one of my mother's colleagues., they are based on a, psychiatrist who is really good with a d h d and patients like this, < slaughter>, um, i'm athletic., um, i'm nice., i like it, i've set other people in front of me, most of the time i don't know if this is a negative or positive quality, i, i don't know., my ideal weekend i would either go, some parties or i'll hang out with my girlfriend, out in fullerton or i'll be in los angeles or on the beach, um, i don't really feel like i've achieved something that i can be appropriately proud of, but i do., very good in sports in high school and, it really is., k, see you.",16
413,"yes, i'm fine., i'm from greenwich connecticut, yes, i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago, i try to go back at least once a year, sometimes i go more times less, overall i think i like where i'm out better than l a in general, um, i think that, other than being somewhere, i'm familiar with the kind of people that are there, are just more my, guy and what i'm used to and, it's less superficial., i moved here after my high school degree, and my mother and sister live in california., at first it was easy because i felt like, it was a new experience, so you somehow adapt and just, experience everything at once, but then after the first years, when it really, how different it is and, what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally, uh visual art and photography, i was interested in photography since high school around i have a lot of programs and, receive awards and such things and publications, so i decided to pursue art, um, yeah, i got a degree in fine arts that i got last year and, , yeah, i really enjoy working in forensics or intervening., i like this better than at first, what i wanted to do was freelance photography, i feel it's a safe job and it's very interesting, um, that's an interesting question., i think just my childhood in general, growing up, well, my family is very close., um, also my extended family and they all live <li>most of them live, within the area or on the east coast in general so we would always great family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that, yes, it's really fun and we try and all together as much as possible, that's, more difficult now that everyone is distributed among different countries and countries, i think i'm more shy., um, i, seeing reality tv i find it kind of funny and lighthearted, around i look like bravo t v like the real housewives shows and, like funny things you don't really have to pay attention to, um, i'm good, i guess i don't really have a temper when i, when i stressed more it definitely shows up in my attitude it but i didn't really like anger, um, well, me and my friend like bicker <laughter> all the time just like, insignificant things, but different from the, i had a fight with my dad a few days ago., um, there was some kind of tension going on., then i went and visited over the holidays in this last winter, things about his girlfriend and, he thinks i should be the one trying to, have a relationship with her although he does not think for any reason that it should go both ways, so for the thirtieth time that he, we were on the phone and he was, i told myself how to call her and talk to her, and i told him i would do it last weekend because of the jewish holidays and, he was very mature and told me oh forget she doesn't want to hear from you now and somehow like i might be less interested because i, i don't care about having a relationship with her, so if she doesn't want to hear from me, you know it's easier for me., um, i mean, every time when <t> i mean, it was the same recurring argument a lot and i wish,, that i could do sometimes, but i wish that the times it turns into an explosive fight, that i could just bite into my tongue, but the thing is, he says,, certain things that are not true, or things he knows how will tick me, who are really mean, and, that he shouldn't say to me, so, so i kind of lose it and i can't really, mm like nothing to say, um, well, i guess the toughest decision i've made that i don't, i just realized that it's the hardest decision to look back when you decide where you, after graduating from high school where you go to college because for me i basically, changed my whole life and moved away and did all this alone, so it didn't seem so difficult to make a decision at the time it felt like a progress of the next step, but now looking back, this is probably one of the most difficult decisions i've made, um, well, i wish i could erase, the event or the sight, my grandmother's funeral,, obviously, it wouldn't change anything., but, it wasn't, seeing her wasn't something i wanted, how to have in my memory, around her she was a very positive influence and always, was not judging, um, and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they are very successful people, so whether or not we have differences of opinion, that we are separate people, they are good role models in terms of what you want to have if you, are older, usually it's easy to stay the problem aseep, no matter how late i go to bed, whether it's ten p m or four a m, i'll be up like clockwork, at seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to, find out why i can't sleep anymore, no, i'm just.., in the morning i'm probably a lighter sleeper, but i just wake up as if i just couldn't stay asleep anymore, which was never a problem that was so consistent, but now it's, i can't remember the last time i slept the morning after eight thirty., i mean, it's easy when i have to do things during the day, it makes it a lot more strenuous., but it's not really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday life, um, i don't know, i feel kind of very, mm, like that, only, no extreme highs no extreme lows it is somehow, a note country, i mean nothing like lately, um, as recently it is just i would say over a period of years i have a kind of gradually settled more and more, reserved only and, not very outgoing, no, no i was diagnosed with fear, i had a few breathing problems for a day or two and had to go to the hospital., because i thought it was more serious because i couldn't breathe, but, they said it was a physical manifestation of my fear, i think in the right environment and, with the person who does it when they are open minded and the therapist, is helpful, and good in what they do, then yeah, no, i haven't been in therapy since i was a kid., i left because my parents thought it was a good idea to like, to deal with all the problems they had with me, but it was never i mean we just sat around talking about my day, it wasn't, i don't feel like i needed therapy back then, so i didn't really get much of it., well, i was happy when i was home with his family at my friend's house for the new year., when i'm there, i can only, we save our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to, paying worrying about bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow, who i have to deal with every morning, we wake up and hang out., just enjoy the day, in general, um, i regret the college i chose to go, i didn't, from the east coast, the entire collegiate system is very different and, universities are not the same as the tightly knit californian school system out here, so, when i was researching colleges, i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college, just like boston college at home, or, you know every other school called college at the end of that i didn't realize until you knew the end of my first year., that it was more like a transfer school like you, you can't even know you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i left., so it kind of creates more problems for me, well, considering i'm twenty two, i'd probably say ten years ago., i'd give myself the advice,, probably stay near home, and to have, really pursued other options, rather than just being fully invested in moving to california, um, my best friend would describe me, as great charismatic funny ending, socially enjoyable person who is different from how, people who are not my good friends would describe me, what i mean i don't mean i mean it's what it is i, i am very outgoing and have a great time when i am with my friends in my element but around strangers and in how unpleasant groups and things i just, i am very shy and, not really., speak a lot, recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clipper basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that, yeah, that's good., um, i'm very caring., i, i am a very good judge of character, what i mean i think i mean i consider it a quality < qu> quality for myself, um, i am very loving <aff>, i mean,, i'm not very tender, i'm more, i mean, i guess i guess so, thank you.",10

487,"<synch>, yes, i'm fine thank you, detroit michigan, yes, i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here, many more years ago more like forty years ago, uh i don't go back to detroit anymore, i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here, in california and, uh completely different um, for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't, the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space, a warmer climate warmer people, just a different, different uh vibe, that i that i like better, after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier, to start over here than some of the other places i had lived, or to stay where we were at, extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it, plus i had also, taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here, and went to school out here so i was completely used to it, well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh, less crowded it's more open space it's a, a calmer friendlier vibe, less rushed, the smog would be one, and when i drive the traffic, in certain areas it can be but, um, in general, there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's, isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens, the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like, i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all, so, i don't travel as much as i used to, but i have traveled worldwide, new experiences, well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled, through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so, i've traveled a lot of different places and, um i'll have to say they were, all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn, enjoy experience, uh my experiences i would say in um, europe visiting moreso i've also visited, uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different, i would probably say more shy um in general, um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing, although, i've had them describe me as outgoing, i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike, listen to music you know, i'm very good at controlling my temper, oh, probably when i was, married with my husband many years ago, it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him, it could be it could be a choice of, uh, some of the instances when i might've been with him and i, you know got emotional or, let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than, um, just you know seen it as, not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so, you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate, but some people, you know don't respond to the so-called norm, if you ignore it, mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case, i taught middle school kids and you can try calm, um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain, you know your professional demeanor so you can't really, um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so, well that could be, several, mm, um i guess a decision in um, along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery, uh, that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way, and in that case she died so, you know, uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious, outcome for them as well, mhm, <sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing, things that you might could do but, they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to, erase them you know if, you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a, strong reaction and they don't really look past the, uh impact of the event, 'cause there might be something that, you can gain from that, but there are i i grew up in a home of, dysfunction so there was, just domestic abuse you know and um, there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things, but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things, that occur in life as an adult that, sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that, have not had really strong experiences, fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so, um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can, walk them through, levels of, understanding and you know, as you know someone, you have a balance of background information on, which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will, progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like, the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be, and you can also relate other experiences to them, of things that were worse or, you know seem to be, and of course there's always in general i mean, when you look at all the calamities in the world, you know most of those things aren't affecting, us or the people that we know here, so that provides, us perspective that, you know can pull someone out of their, i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly, intensity of their experience right at the moment, well we have a a good relationship they, eh for the most part there are different levels of, um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has, made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others, some have not had um, as much, experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way, so it's always evolving, and i, walk in positivity as a a lead of, you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender, a more positive, response from them, rather than feed, sometimes the, um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have, pardon, i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat, hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends, well my mother has always been a very calm, um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of, negativity i've had teachers that have um been, very um, positive <po> positive and proactive, and have you know taught independent thinking and, techniques to rise above some of the things that, were occurring, and just various friends that you know i would see handling, situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so, it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good, um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or, you know um, trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but, um, in general i don't have a problem sleeping, it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done, i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so, um but in general good, like, i mean, not in particular, i mean i just seems, um, less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do, in a shorter period of time but, you know reorganizing, some of the, things that need to be done, you know can smoothe that out, no i haven't but i know it's something that, a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have, i have not no, well there's several i guess um, and happiness comes in, small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning, is great, wonderful, you know day of happiness um, as far as big, celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum, you know, in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be, you know a moment shared with someone you know so, it should be an even on an even keel, um, as uh uh, perseverant, um you know i will, continue forth and, and um, positive, upbeat, um, maybe not doing, things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or, or spending my, time you know a little more differently but, that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see, you know you could've done some things differently, instead of buying, the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that, i would have um, made myself move to california sooner and i'm, i would have um, instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss>, would have you know the situation i have now, waited to get something different but you know how can you, you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time, with the best information <in> information available, you know after you have looked at several options, of um, being, independent and educated able to, uh take care of myself, okay, bye bye now",0

don't talk to anyone, uh, uh, i guess a few days ago, okay, well, basically, i feel that the best way to keep people in my life is, with fake people in my life through online multiplayer games with avatars, and user names and everything and, i'm just having a little fun, go with these avatars in virtual worlds, and talk to people like that, so they don't know who i really am, you don't even know

ever had to make was, man i really don't know, um, my father has to go through the surgery and see how he suffers., well, he had a tumor he had to remove., so it was just hard to see him in bed and just be in the hospital if he really didn't want to be there because he's a real living person and he'd rather run around and stuff, but just seeing him stuck in bed was just awful, uh me and my family aren't very close we're not, i mean, they were always there for me and i appreciate it, but we never had this close connection < collection> connection <con> connection around, especially since they're strangers so they don't really understand where i'm trying to get out, have grown up, america so it is quite different when it comes to these cultural <cu> racially i mean the cultural boundaries that we somehow take a step across each other's feet on, but apart from that, we have a decent relationship when we talk to each other, it's kind of embarrassing, but it's okay., i think they're out of control., i think they're learning things they shouldn't know at this age, i think they're doing things they shouldn't do, and i don't feel that enough people are telling them they shouldn't, i feel like they're applauded, from the media they are applauded by celebrities to whom they follow, and there's not enough done, and they just get lost, depends on the night on some nights, it's pretty hard for me to fall asleep like a baby., usually creative actually, if i can't sleep, i just stay up and write something or read a book and ideas will pop up., these things are

balance each other., no, no, the last time i felt really happy was, hm, today, from the moment i woke up, it was a beautiful sunny day., i, went to a few friends we had a good time in school, had some good grades on some papers to write a good essay, feel quite successful and, i feel like my day is just, a good day, my best friend would describe me as strange <laughter>, most people would describe me as strange, i say a lot of strange things that i do strange things that i'm interested in things that most people aren't., um, just like old literature, for revolutionary stuff, uh things about the change of the world, but, by subterranean means, um, no, i don't live a life of regret, fear can never stop you from doing something, um, i'm just reading around with some friends., ride around and find something to do just on an adventure, i don't wish i could change something about myself, i just wish i could build myself into the person i really should be., um, this once i and my best friend got into an argument, and she pointed to all the things i've done, that i shouldn't have done, all at once, how i hurt the people, how i hurt them, the wise men i've done to them who have been brutal, and it just made me feel bad when i reflect on everything, my parents, i mean, although we don't see eye to eye, they always bring me to this realization that i need at the end of the day, although i never listen to her or i don't choose to listen to her, when it happens, i learned from it and i'm like oh that's what my parents told me, so i learned to trust them more and i learned,, understand that they are wiser than me and they know more than me, i don't travel so much around l a anymore, try to see new sights, but as far as i don't travel outside, to discover new things to discover things you never knew they were there, or the limitless possibilities, to discover i like to discover new people, new cultures, new things that go against the normal for us and for me, a few days ago, i just drove into the middle of the desert, and i just sat there, and i just enjoyed everything the desert had to offer and it was just pleasant, i felt free from all this, these cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be outside, in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time, it felt good, i'm very proud that i've always been different., that despite how many people have

very outgoing, mm, i go on uh facebook, or i check my emails, or i watch movies, comme ci comme ca, sometimes i'm really good for the most part, but there are times um when i'm feeling very stressed and i have uh, temper outburst uh anger outbursts, i don't know <sigh> about , um, maybe um, thirty days, ago, and it was about, my inadequate parenting skills, , um, ashamed, angry, confused, but uh um i also felt like i needed to uh have, my perspective understood, i have four kids, three boys and one girl, , uh my oldest son is uh living in mar vista and he's doing some menial job, um he's creative and artistic and has a really good heart, um my uh third son is <i> my second son <s> uh son 'cause he's my third child, um lives in alabama he has a daughter, and he also has a menial job, um, uh but he moved there to be with his daughter he's not together with his uh daughter's mother, and um, he's funny and really smart, and um, <sigh>, wickedly clever, and my uh third son my youngest is living in los angeles, is living on his own, um, working at a menial job, is kind of finding himself, he's extremely kind and sensitive and caring and loving, um, but he tends to be uh pretty hard on himself um, and has a lot of opinions about a lot of things, mm i love being a parent but being a parent isn't easy, um, the unconditional love you feel for your children, tolerating um, their shortcomings and their suffering, and feeling like, regret for not having done a better job, um i think i tell my children that i love them, and that i'm proud of them and that um, i have a much more open communication and, uh i'm more accepting of the choices, uh that they make even though i might not agree with them, i'm, uh, close to my sisters, um i'm pretty distant from my mother, um i was close when i was younger to my father but he passed away when i was twenty five, my college professors, um i think that they uh, uh helped me perceive a different perspective on, uh human beings, um made me more altruistic and more um, open and less judgment judgmental, being poor, and unsuccessful, <deep breath>, mm i think i could've made um, better choices, eh, regarding the, fathers of of my children, and <a> and or stepfathers, maybe , <sigh> when um i uh, i left my kids, um, my first marriage, i uh, i was really uh immature and unknowledgeable and felt that i, um couldn't provide for my children so i made a choice to, leave them with their father for a period of time, um, and that was a regret, and then when um i was thirty six, i was diagnosed with cancer and um, i had to make the choice of again, uh leaving my kids with their perspective fathers, and um, uh until i got better i wasn't able to, um be a full-time mother, yeah it was, separation from my kids is really hard separation from my kids is really hard um, i feel, ashamed and guilt and remorse, because had i, had a more um stable, uh, uh financial um, hmm, uh, uh financial and emotional and psychological foundation, i might have had the ability to not have caused them, um, some of the problems that they have today, mm sometimes good, i have to be really tired, um sometimes not so good, mm, ineffective, mm, ineffective, <deep breath> <sigh> i think i'm making more of a conscientious effort to um, get organized and, uh, um take some um, steps to, uh physical health um well-being, um, getting out more forcing myself to uh participate in life more, no, yes, um originally i think i was diagnosed in nineteen, eighty, maybe before that but it was never a formal diagnosis, um i tried to commit suicide, yes, sometimes, um, i uh i'm no longer, uh truly suicidal, mm, i don't know, two thousand six two thousand seven, <deep breath> <sigh>, went to the beach for a walk with my dog, i have, a great ability to empathize i am open to, learning um, i crave learning, i'm um socially empathetic, i love my children, um, i'm a good friend, mm, well my depression is one thing, um, um, i wish i was more intelligent, that school was easier for me, um, i wish i didn't have uh such low self-esteem, um, i wish i could be, more motivated in participating in areas that i'm interested in, yeah, go to college, my children, goodbye",8
477,"<synch>, yes thanks, i'm well thank you how are you, i grew up in oklahoma, mhm, um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here, my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much, <sniffle>, oklahoma's very different um, uh l_a's a lot more exciting, there's a lot more um, uh to do here and um, uh the ocean obviously is very nice so, um, you know that's a good question i um, i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and, i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come, very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made, <laughter>, pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural, it seemed like a good fit, um i just really like it here, oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach, um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or, um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice, mm, i studied philosophy and um political theory and government, and did a little bit of english literature on the side, um it, kind of just happened naturally i think uh, i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different, areas and, i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that, um, not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities, um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often, <laughter> um, you know i have actually studied to become a success coach, um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice, aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students, um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams, um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that, um, you know it can be challenging for people to actually, be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um, undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it, uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too, um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so, um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people, i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged, and i think that um is, something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted, um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers, <laughter> pretty good i think, um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time, not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no, hmm, hmm, i'm not sure, it would've probably been a discussion over politics, and it probably would've been a friendly argument, um, probably with one of my liberal friends so, but i actually can't remember the specific time, <laughter>, <sniffle>, mm, i meditate, um i, do that almost every day, um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful, um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts, so that's nice, mm, well let me think about that for a minute, <sigh>, hmm, <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um, just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>, <sigh>, hmm, okay i'm sorry <laughter>, hmm, well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly, um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but, um i do have it sometimes, probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it, you know if i didn't have it, um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um, it's usually me in school somewhere, at the end of the semester, haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail, and, you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i, study and attend class the way i should have, um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating, and i'm not exactly sure, why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so, no i don't think so, um at least not not that i'm aware of, <sniffle>, i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew, and they live on the east coast, and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um, i when i used to live there when he was younger, um spent a lot of time with them and, since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so, for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back, in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them, um and that i felt bad about because, we really enjoy each other's company and he, um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back, so that's um, that makes me feel bad sometimes, mm, um, well i have a brother i'm very close to him, he's younger, and, um he's like four four and a half years younger, he's married um i have a nephew, um my both of my parents have passed away, so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them, um, on my father's side there's one brother, um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are, <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um, most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um, so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then, but you know we're not that close with our extended family so, um, i'd say well, um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences, , when i came out to california, um, i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um, it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so, um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and, um we just established this really strong friendship and, she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um, but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um, and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know, i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice, i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um, sometimes my you know, depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but, um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful, um and i can sleep, uh, you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles, so, um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination, um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night, or at least if i do i don't remember it, so, um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit, because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home, most of the time but then i travel, like one week a month, and when i travel i'll take the red-eye, um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i, um sleep, poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep, and the first day, after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay, but usually the second day is not very good, um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate, and um, i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle, i would say good, um, summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little, um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about, um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good, not really i can't i can't think of anything um, there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um, and i hike with friends and, um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated, um because i didn't really exercise when i was there, and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like, it's okay, thank you, no, no, hmm well, , he's a lot of fun and, um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and, we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and, um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun, hmm, <sigh>, well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun, but that i can be serious, and um, that i you know care about others, uh, and that i'm loyal, and, i'm not sure what else, um, i think those those are probably the main things, <sniffle>, um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so, um, i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem, uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar, i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging, um and i wish that i um, , i don't know, uh, i think i wish that i was in a relationship, so, probably those things, mm, hmm, so at the last organization i used to work at, i had a boss and she was, i don't feel like she was um, i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh, used to push my buttons or so i thought, and so um, one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer, um and he was upset about something and, it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was, um, but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i, have very strong opinions about how you handle, challenges with people <peo> with staff members, and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought, um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel, um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it, and um, i did you know, i tried to be very calm and, said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but, uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there, to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me, or after we had that interaction so, <laughter>, so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this, thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had, read it back then, which is, um when you think about buying something instead of thinking, uh oh, here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it, it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that, because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it, you know, intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so, you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh, been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago, <sigh> probably, , um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them, and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them, so, <sigh> let's see, well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore, uh and i got to fly first class, um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um, tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because, um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too, sure, thank you, bye",2
468,", yeah, i'm fine with that., i'm pretty good to feel a little tired, but uh, feeling pretty good for most of it, around redondo beach, yep, i like the beach i like the mountains, love how to go surfing in the morning snowboarding in the day, um, i like walking in these mountains of santa monica mountains, to be exact, i don't like traffic, i don't like people's overload here., and i don't like it, the price of the cost of living in certain areas, i tried to really.., last year was the summer of, really street tripping and out with my girlfriend around, we want to go to costarica this summer and hopefully to south america and then maybe even take a road trip., see below in the south some of the southern states, but i was in canada, i was in mexico and ecuador., was in different countries here and there, try to get out of there, i love meeting new people, i love experiencing new things that try differently <diffing>, various foods that are native to this area, and, it's just part of the journey i love to explore what you know., this planet we call earth, just recently we went to seattle and canada with a few friends and uh, it was beautiful we uh flew in seattle, and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and, on the way to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy it was beautiful just, very lush beautiful trees the uh, the climate was nice the sea was right there it was the people were great it was just a fun trip all around, yeah, that's good., , was probably the uh, the trip we made to colorado last summer, and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver, and we didn't really have a plan that we knew we knew about some people who lived there and.., only the day before we contacted them and had to tell them we were coming to the area., and they were only shown great hospitality they brought us at the airport let us crash in their place for a few days we, let's even use your car to explore the state and go to wyoming and, see, the neighbors in the north it was just a great trip great people and, it was just everything worked very well just every day there was something new and fun to do, yeah, that's good., i uh i studied business administration, and uh economy at the moment, i've always wanted, own my own business and i thought management was a, a good uh foundation to build and uh learn more about it so i decided to just go into management, see the different aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and to, and then economy is just, just for long term investment i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e t fs and investment funds and, start buying my portfolio up, so i thought economy would be a good way to make a long term investment financially, so that's why i made my economy, yeah, i'm really excited it was, one of the best choices of my life, yeah, that's good., i consider myself more outgoing i am, i'm pretty friendly, i don't mind opening up to people and stuff., i like to be outside like walking, i like working at the gym, but.., i usually like to be outdoors i love nature and just be outside, i just feel good., of pretty good for most part i'm pretty gentle chill guy and when i get angry here and there, i don't know., it only takes a few minutes and before i know it, i just blow about i tend not to hold on to things or stay, angry and resentment, just because, there is no need, life is too short for all this, um, i can't even remember when i was arguing with someone., i have no idea., probably when my uh, my brother and my girlfriend came in a little, little argument, like two birthdays ago and it's kind of embarrassing since, i wish i'd taken care of it., right then and there, instead of letting it just stretch out as long as it's been, it's just embarrassing for both parties, i wish i'd only communicated with both of them and, said to them, you know, set aside their differences and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution, but now it's just, inconvenient, yes, it does., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, man who's tough, i don't think i've had too many., hard decisions to really say the toughest decision i ever had to make to, maybe, not to colorado for my undergrad, two three years ago, was a little hard just because i kind of think what if, but nothing else was really too hard in my life that, was really so hard of a decision, i don't feel guilty about anything., pretty good person i think and for the most part, i couldn't figure anything out., something i could wish i could erase from my memory., nothing to be really honest i, i love all my memories they are usually positive for most, i know it's kind of, strange to say for someone, but i've lived a pretty good life and, i'm happy, yeah, that's good., i'm usually quite independent, so when i see her here and there it is., we go through long times without contact maybe a few weeks sometimes even a month, but when i see her, it's, it's good that you know that i like to say hello and show them that i still love them and, it's not like i don't want me to contact her, they could always contact me, but.., it's good for most i think as a young adult, mm, the family of my girlfriend uh, they were very positive in my life, if it wasn't for them, i would go in another direction., just because i didn't care so much about high school., really long term thinking, and uh just to see her and, what their family does and, how they think differently, how with your higher education and how to go somewhere in life and what if you do these things, this is what it could lead to,, and they were very successful they own their own uh, accounting practice and, see that influences me to reach higher ones in life, yeah, that's good., it's pretty easy for most of me just close my eyes and, wake up in the morning, i'm tired, sometimes i'm tired, could feel that i'm a little drained and uh, maybe a little groggy here and there, and that's it., feel pretty good for most of it a little bit, stressed just because the finals are uh next week, and uh i want to do really well and only you know, close this last semester and i graduate in two weeks, and, for the most part, that's the only thing i'm really nervous about, but for the most part, i'm really excited about, i'm going to be fired for a week after graduation maui i'm, see what the future holds, where we will live <l> me and my girlfriend will live and, what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just happy to be finished with school for a while, yeah, that's good., i have never been diagnosed with p t s d, i have never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>, the last time i felt really happy was likely to see my girlfriend graduation a few days ago she uh just graduated from nursing school on monday, and uh seeing her go over stage and all that just because we've been together for six years and they're going through, the care programme for five and, it's just, seeing all the ups and downs is really good to see that someone simply strives through and achieves what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of them., yeah, that's good., probably outgoing friendly, positive vibes all around, adventurous, loves sport, team player knows how to be a leader here and there, and uh, is a little open sometimes, no not really for the most part, no, not really., just a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just, maybe because i'm done with school right now and i'm over feeling that i just don't feel so motivated, but i just want to be more motivated and determined, now and that's not, i'm not going that far now., mhm, no biggie, <sigh>, oh, man, i couldn't, i can't think of any more time., i dug two weeks ago., that was a lot of fun, we went to sequoia national park and i went with a, for a r t m class it's like this uh recreation tourism management class and cave research was an elective subject and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he brought us to these various caves in uh, sequoia and only, me and these strangers or my classmates and getting really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and climbing back into caves through various rooms and slides, it was a lot of fun., that was, yeah, that's good., ten or twenty years ago, i'd say i'd focus more on school., slightly less on the social aspects, and uh, somehow to hold with a sport just to see how far that could get you, to <sigh>, sometimes don't play hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and around, and that's pretty much it now, i'm proud that i'm really proud that i'm doing my bachelor's degree and i'm, looking for a full time job i work at a law firm now, so i have something to do for myself, i'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person in the long term <w> long term thinking wise i'm a well rounded person, and i really want to explore the world, so i'm kind of proud that i've opened my eyes and now i have different perspectives and, really have an open mind for people and instead of judging them, you know it's freedom why not let them do what they want, and uh, i am really proud to finally get my bachelor and hopefully go to my m b a in a few years., safe, see you.",4
372,"yes, um, pretty good type of, <laughter> yeah, over los engeles, yes, the thing i like about the weather, it's not easy to meet people, well, it just feels like, people aren't very out there, they're like the movie in the crash where people are just sitting in their cars all the time., it feels like this, no, not too much, development of children, well, i have a son and, i wanted to know how to make a good mother and so i wanted to know, about the stages he would go through, eh and be able to relate better to him, mhm, i'm, i'm trying to start it again in the fall., i'd like to write, all right., i wrote some children's books., and, i've just been researching., to get published in my books, it's just like two i've written so far, but, they are, pretty good, i got some good feedback from my review groups, <laughter> it's about, a little boy surrounded by people who are idiots and he tries to, not to become a fool with them, and <laughter> it puts him in like a really, , he walks through many moods in dealing with the people in his life, mhm, yes, i had a few problems with nervous breakdowns and at the moment my son lives with his father, so <laughter>, no, i'm a single mother, it was the hardest thing., i think in the world <laughter> is a single mother <laughter>, so, how can i handle this?, to <sigh>, good now., um, i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so, that was the problem, it's so spontaneous, like the stuff that comes out of the children's mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and, only brings a smile to your face, um, good, when my son was younger, once we sat just around the house and, he comes and he starts to do my hair and he says to me, mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails, so you can go out and get married and find a friend <laughter> so, yes, it's quite spontaneous things like that happen, that my child tells me that i don't have to be single anymore, the most difficult <sigh>, i don't want to mess it up, i feel a lot of stress and pressure, the, every little thing will make a difference and make matter, in what kind of person my child turns out, and, so, there's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., definitely, um, hmm, i think, i'm different from my mother., because i'm a little more tolerant for this spontaneous interaction, i appreciate that you know i'm welcome., i'm getting to know who my child is now., and, don't try to mold them into someone i want them to, but just, see how they will be the best, child that they are the best adult that they can be without, to shape them necessarily in this direction, to another person <laughter>, so, say it again., who is someone who has a positive influence?, to <sigh>, mm, i don't have anyone., it's like the, all right., all right., i tried to meditate sometimes, but i don't really hold on to it, often enough, um, i tried., to go for walks, but i don't always do that, and i don't always stick with it, so, yes, it is., i'd say , i'm, slightly less than average importance, that i'm getting angry, more than most people i think, hmm, last night, <laughter> but it was on the phone i was arguing with my husband, we have my sister who lives with us., and she lives with us in a very small room with, a small apartment i should say, and she's got four people living in a room, so.., it's kind of stressful it's really crowded, and my husband is stressed about it, and, you know, i'm just saying to him that, i told you when my sister moved in., then there was a mess in the house and she'll ask for things you don't really want to do, so my sister <laughter> so the house is chaotic and it is crowded, and every day they ask for journeys and my husband, he's.., avoid coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore, and i'm just saying that, he'll have to find a way to deal with it because, he asked for him, in my opinion, for <laughter> so <laughter>, hmm, it does <laughter>, oh, i've got tons of them, but right now., what comes to my mind is to lose custody of my son., um, now like, i had a fight with my stepmother., and, my step sister for a long time over, my son and how they treat him and how i want to treat him, as if they had no limits, and i think borders are important to find out who the adult is who the child is, they had my child command her around and all., in any case, because of this, you will testify in custody against me that, yeah, they'll say i'm not a good mother., because i believe in borders and we have very different, ideas about raising children, she's my stepmother, she's my father's fifth wife., and, she's, it's not really far from, how i grew up and i want to raise my child, similar to how i grew up where you are, we had some independence and we had some limitations and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us., and, with my stepmom she no rules she has no expectation she just wants to run wild, and have everything he wants, and that's okay if you're a grandparents, but the problem is that i live with them sometimes, and when i'm in the same house with them, they should follow my rules., and not, try to go and break all my rules, yeah, that's good., at this moment <sigh>, only really frustrated because they don't listen to me, i feel, disrespectful i feel, how invisible, i feel, only angry, the, they take away my right to parenthood and it's something i really worked hard to do, i went to school and studied child development, i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>, i know what i'm talking about, i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting skills., and, to have these people who have not done the same thing and have worked as hard as i must be a good parent, try to tell me i'm a bad parent, it's really, uh, hard to believe, so i feel very disrespectful, um, unrecognized angry frustrated, all these things <laughter>, um, i'll take benadryl to help me sleep, and i'm, so, my doctor gave me that she gave me benadryl, that i could take it to help me sleep., and last night i cried, before i went to sleep, so sometimes these thoughts begin to run through the head at night when you are in bed, but i tried to push her out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep easier, yeah, i always think about my son., as i wish he were with me, and how unfair all that happens is, and as i don't deserve it, to take my son away from me because i'm a really good mother, you know, and i'm too hard for myself, so, but i'm a good mother and i feel confident that i'm a good mother, i just.., i don't really have the money to take care of my son, like my son's father, who has more money than i do., and right now i'm trying to agree to it because, i know he can do more for him., financially than i could, but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mother., hmm, i'm pretty depressed i'm on antidepressants, um, i'll take wellbutrin., i've been with you for a few weeks., i think they're working, i don't know., i'm not like, i'm here today and i'm dressed. i've done it and i'm here today., not so bad, um, uh, um, uh.., my husband complains a lot he says, i'm not the same person, that i was when he married me, he said i was funny and i was positive and, i was all those other optimistic things that another thing he told me on the phone last night and < sniffle>, and, i'm not those things anymore, what's true, i mean, we got married a year ago., and then my son was taken shortly afterwards and it was just like, a shock, and, i was just trying to get back from it., but it was hard., i thought i had a problem before i found out, found out what, oh, um, yeah like crying a lot like i'm crying all the time <sbbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying, but, how to, my family would invite me, on family events, and i'd go and just cry because my son wasn't there., or by, i don't know., it's just the whole crying i think, and as i said, my husband, lets me know that i'm not the same person, so, he's disappointed., and i feel bad, even that i'm not the same person he knew, i also feel bad about it., another thing i feel bad about, you know, yeah, i'm trying., i feel like therapy is useful, um, yeah, it's nice to talk about your problems that i go in there and cry every week., so at least i have a fixed time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter>, um, that's what i mean, it's a liberation, able to cry sometimes i feel better after, um, yeah, that's good., and she helps me make decisions you know, help me to be more proactive in my life, um, all right., i'm looking for, jobs and such things and they give me ideas why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about it, you know, and then she said something about, why don't you go back to school and, so i went and applied to go back to school, you know i don't, much with my life and, sitting around all day doesn't help my depression either, so i'm trying to find a job and i applied for college, in autumn i was accepted to dominguez hill, so i can go back to school in the fall, now i'm still looking for work, but she's helping me with something like that just to give me ideas., that life is not over <laughter> that there are more that you know i could do, live with life yeah, everything is always, bittersweet, um, i don't know., the last time i was really happy, i don't know <laughter>, my ideal weekend, oh, i don't have much money because i'm not working right now, so my weekends are really just spent, maybe read, but i can't really, i, i can't pay much attention when i read, so <laughter> i have a short attention span that i can only read a few chapters <depth breath> around, but lately i've been saying that this is what i've done is reading, something i've read, , all right., i like to go to u s c, they have these nights, where, they have things like book signings or poetry and art called visions and voices., so i like to go to their events <t>, and i usually enjoy this, um, about two weeks ago, around deborah harkness there was a book caption for, a discovery of witches, and as i said, i'm trying to be a writer, so i'm trying to go to the book captions above all, and see what it's like to be an author who, conversation with a lot and signing books <laughter>, my son, i don't have any friends., my best qualities, um, i'm smart., i look good., um, i'm really.., and like a hard worker, i'm dedicated to self improvement, um, that's all i can think about right now <laughter>, all right., all right., goodbye., press the summer now",13
351,"yes, <clears throat>, okay, um new york, um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry , uh yes, i'm self-employed, um to become a music producer, um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter>, um, to pursue a job, uh when um, about a year ago last february, it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast, um i think i've been there twice in the past year, no i'm more of a creature of habit, um yes, uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things, um, <laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs, um <clears throat>, probably um people being insensitive <insen> um, not very um very nice to me or um, seeing injustices or um, i think that's about it <laughter>, um pretty good, you know sometimes <so>, um, probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that, yeah it does <laughter>, pretty close, um my best friend so i um, oh just one of my friends, um, i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually, um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion , um, um probably spending time with my family, in new york, very close, um, my sister and my brother, um i don't know they're just great people, and i love them a lot and, they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me, um, probably, um, i guess loyal um, sensitive um <laughter> , i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter>, no, no <clears throat> , yes, gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago, um, i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff, um not currently i i did about like six months ago, um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and, she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change, it's okay <laughter>, um yes i do actually um , when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do, um, i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um, when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um , also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself, so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat>, um, feeling hopeless all the time, not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues , um, having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life , um, sometimes they are at like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me , um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal, to record things, <clears throat> , um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter> , um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it, um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult, um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat>, um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um, that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter>, um probably christmas time when i was with my family , um just really happy and um, feeling like everything was alright in my life , having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself, um, probably you know um, let's see that's a hard question, i think probably, i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um , uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um, i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter> , um, um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um, one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter> , um, don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um, i think that's it <laughter>, um, i don't know, that's a good question, probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um , so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher, um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out, for about six years so seven years , yeah it was awesome, um, i was really kind of like um , reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat>, so uh and then i went a worked in a um, mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so, it found like a good niche for me, <laughter> okay, no problem <laughter>, goodbye <laughter>",14
321,"yeah, i'm okay, um chicago illinois, mhm, uh my husband's work was here, in eighty four, it was not easy for me it took about three years, um just the move i moved away from my family so i was uncomfortable i didn't know anyone here and even though i did make friends i just felt out of place, uh not as often as i would like i used to go back like at least once a year but in the last few years that's diminished so i would say like every three years, the weather <laughter>, i love the weather the beach, um you know as i've been here as long as i have the people you know some nice people here, um the people some of the people <laughter> um, yeah, also um, i i would say the economy, it's very difficult to make it here in los angeles, business, and computer graphics, i'm not working in it right now, i'm working in retail, i just eh couldn't find work, and so i had to settle for doing that for right now, it's very tough, um i would like to be a human resource representative, mhm, no, um i like to talk to people too much, and, when i understand or i i know a lot about a subject i can go on and on about it and i'm interested in finding out about people if i'm sitting next to somebody i'll strike up a conversation with them just to find out who they are and, just um you know i'd i like to talk to people i enjoy it, i'm quiet, um, let's see rude people, um people that harm children and the elderly <el> elderly that makes me very angry, uh war, i control my temper, i i don't have a problem with that i just get quiet when i feel angry and i try to think before i act , the last time i argued with someone was about a month ago, and it was with my daughter and um i was arguing with her over her therapy, she has cancer and um she wasn't telling me enough she wasn't giving me enough information and so that made me very angry i was frustrated and angry, yeah it was very hard, no <laughter>, watching your children fail when they're trying hard or seeing that they can hurt themselves and trying to prepare them for that when they won't listen to your advice, and they uh i feel like sometimes they need to trust me more, mhm, um the love of my children, yeah, uh when i was uh playing with my granddaughter and that was about a month ago, very excited and happy and just um all my cares were gone, i wasn't thinking about anything except for having fun with her so it was a good time, yeah it's the best <laughter>, no, yes, um it was over five years ago, i couldn't function, i couldn't drive i couldn't sleep i couldn't eat um at my i i couldn't do anything i was completely , shut down, i felt like i felt like i was looking out a window and and life was going on outside that window and i was just stuck i behind the glass i i couldn't participate , um i knew something wasn't right, but i, lately i've been feeling depressed, mhm, i haven't had a good night's sleep in, a year i would say, i i my regular pattern is to maybe sleep in a an hour up to three hour intervals and i just keep waking up and i never quite get into a deep sleep , um groggy, and i have no energy, it's very hard because it's uh difficult to work, and it's difficult to concentrate i make mistakes and i forget a lot, mhm, um yes i do mhm, yes, no i'm not in therapy right now, i could not afford to continue, i'm sorry what, i'm not sure, yes, yeah, um, i i feel uh more relaxed and, i i feel like some of my worries are lifted from me i i have uh, i can think clearer because i'm using the tools that i've learned through therapy, mhm, my children, mhm, um, i don't know <laughter>, friendly, i think it's just horrible <laughter> , um i feel that um, the children are so neglected today and it's not the fault of the parents i think that um, i think that we as a society we forgot that it takes a village to raise a child and, nobody wants to pitch in noone wants to help anymore noone's helping their neighbor and it's very sad, mhm, um, i don't know, um eating dinner with my family, i regret not spending enough time on my education , um i had children very young, so i needed to, yeah i needed to uh take care of them, i'm sure i could have, to seek help, my grandparents, um just they introduced me to church and, um just you know letting me play at their home and play in their garden it just showed me a lot of love and and i felt like i was cared for, mhm, no, uh listening to music watching um my a funny program on t_v, going to school working, that's, um go to dinner, with a friend, over a year ago, my friend, um, through work, um very close, mhm, you're welcome, bye",20
462,", yeah, that's good., i'm fine., i'm from los closeles, mhm, oh around the weather <laughter> the weather the weather the weather of the beach the weather of the beach the peace of the, driving instead of public transport, and the sporting, um, i'm really, i don't know how much i miss it., uh uh mm, i don't know, there's not much i don't like about l a compared to most cities i really, it's my favorite and i've lived all over the world i love it i love l a, much, < slaughter>, yes, i've lived, in paris and i have been a lot around the world, it's just.., fun and it's it's it's it's it's an explosion it's good to see new places it's good to, we have to go., experience all the, fantastic to attractions and and, <ss> and cultures, i mean, um, uh, um, uh, i tended to actually do a lot of them around i would probably do them differently i think i'm more than one person developed now i, i lived in paris for two years, so i lived in spain., spain was funny spain it madrid is a party city and then around, and then that was all the work they were all work, so i worked, so it was.., there's a loop you didn't really appreciate what was around you and then, i mean, i'm still.., i still love to go just to know you vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really, a moron for this kind of stuff, um, i guess madagascar, was pretty much just, really annoying because it was about it in the eighties and, it was like you were seeing a lot, uh people who'd never seen white people before, according to the guy who's been driving us around, he might have lied., but it was just, it was annoying africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah, i'm in the process of getting an early childhood education., graduation and then i got a little paralegal, but that was really just, just for the.., just to get the scholarship i didn't really have a concept of what i want to do now i really do, i said, i'm supposed to rattle, i don't know if you guys were able to overhear, i really think that.., the way in which the school system at the moment is all about it, it makes people in, in order to only, just uh dog eat dog to you know i don't like the way, people <peo>it i think it's so emptying the school system now and i feel pretty bad for everyone, so i want to try to fix that, that would be my dream job, so i'm excited that like i want to go in a direction i want to and yes, that would be my dream job to work, with somehow getting to children on a more organic universe, you know, uh trajectory, um, i think it could be done, i don't think it would be done about, some kind of.., legislation, except here and there, i mean, it always comes to you knowing., facade and farce itself anyway, but i think there are ways, i have always reached children anyway and they have always felt where i came from and so, i think you know there are ways to talk to the system without even using the system, i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think, um, i don't really know, i'm kind of i could even work out there could overcompensate some debauchery for what's actually shyness and vice versa, so you don't know,, <laughter> yeah, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's cool., um, i'm definitely.., uh try to reflect and stay in a fairly clear space as often as possible, a lot lying right now i'm in transition so there's only a lot and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot, so this is, quite reassuring i'm not trying to do i'm not really doing something that's also, tense, unless it's time for it like time to drive at a job or time, you know, go some things happen meetings and stuff, but otherwise, i try to stay in a rather relaxed room most of the time, so it's not like break and, but you know it, and i do., i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer is coming, so i'm going to swim a few more, if i'm really outraged, it comes out and then it's me who's a kind of, bad parts right now because it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child, so.., there are times when i'm just gonna blow up a storm just to get off some steam, a little bit, but usually there's always.., you know someone, in the periphery that it gets and you know it's like this bumper sticker, if you're not outraged you don't watch out so, as a rule, some kind of reason can prevail., oh well i mean, these are times when i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i'm arguing with people, it was a lot of times when i'm flat out, you know to sabotage or definitely just, if uh what is the last certain time good i, you know that i've lost my temper terribly with, the woman who gave birth to me because in many cases she is intrinsic, i mean, she's pretty much a terrible person, so i recently lost my temper with her., i felt like.., i mean, i like it again, i think i said that just now i felt, in a way, good, because, i see., you know what's contrary to not getting it, this is, even worse, but i guess there's another side of the bank, of, the thing to get to where, you can be a little more constructive about it, it's like, you know, you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a terrible travesty, but then you have to figure out how to deal with the terrible travesty., but i mean, i didn't feel like i didn't feel like shame i really felt honest no shame i didn't feel i didn't feel, there are times when i feel that it was stupid to lose my temper just because, there are people trying to use this against you, that's all., but i never feel really bad for, being angry about what i'm angry about, when i was pregnant, i wish i had.., like i said, i've been through it., such an awakening upon knowledge when i was, it's like an undercover., that my respect has become a big issue, and, when i was pregnant, i ended up being so disrespectful in the place because i was a hippie on the beach for six years, so i always felt like i was being so disrespectful in the place where, to i was ready to be when the child came that i, stormed out, about what was a good survival mode before, but, let me jump out of the frying pan into the fire and they had my child, so, yeah, that's good., it sucks., yeah, that's good., i don't want to erase anything from my memory, i may have consolidated everything and, working together, i don't know., and integrated i don't want to erase anything from my memory, well, i got it right or i got it wrong, < slaughter>, yeah, i guess the hardest decision was whether or not., characters around, sign mediation agreement with d c f s and i should have said no, just let us go straight to court because the, there's nothing wrong with me just, it may happen that , give a s s i check by bullshit with my mother and i would only have, did you know?, courageous enough to just go in there and do that, and instead, i sniffed out and made her mediation, and they tricked me, over precautionary, it's, horrible horrific bourgeois quality, intrigue and sabotage is bad, it's okay., someone i mean, there was.., you know there was something., some great people uh back from afar i didn't somehow, really.., a really great ability to build relationships, and i'm working through that right right now and i think that's a lot of why i don't have my son, but, as i have grown and developed, i have seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so this is wonderful and, but otherwise you know a constant, you know, contact with someone who's really good for me, it's been hard for me,, come to this point, not so easy in these days at all, i'm so i don't, completely centered and then there were some, um, actually, you know that., uh, people think it's funny to bother me or shake me as they pass by and so there was real harassment, and such things, um, i'm still pretty polyanna'd out i'm still forging ahead and trying to be as pleasant as possible, i'm tired and empty and a little frustrated because i know that., i was kind of, that somehow i'm a little bit, around my around energy and space is usurped <u> usurped and i can say, and i don't know how to get through that and past it, no, no, um, there's i'm basically i'm very very happy pretty much, blissful person, but, in order to fight this battle for my son, i have a kind of trembling area that, it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my street in childhood before i realized that i was such a happy person, are thrown there again, so i go through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes, but, you know, during the day, i'm gonna think of something completely true and organic and i'm just gonna stare at something and wow that's beautiful and i'm gonna be reminded that i'm, pretty close to my mind so, um, i'm trying to stay there twenty four seven i'm pretty spiritual in this way, um, um.., uh, fun, i mean, if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me, it's gonna be pretty competitive out there., that you know that's me is gone from you., that i'm funny and that.., and the, i think that's bad that i'm funny and that i'm good and that i'm trustworthy, um, just uh i'm i'm not necessarily changing, but grow through my ability to connect with the people i want to connect with, and from the people who, to manage to , to, drain me, i told you, i'm sorry about.., to leave the place where i could have delivered my son even though i was, um uh a kind of, abuse, piss off your mother <laughter>, i'm sorry, you know it and you like a lot of the <th>, and and, yes and to open your eyes, look what's going on, i am proud of my spirit and outlook and, my access to what's really going on in the world and, my for alertness, of which i am only proud, i as a person, all right., you're welcome., see you.",9

411,"sure, pretty good, new york, uh i moved to l_a in the seventies, but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places, of, um, i guess every few years but, i travel a lot so i've lived in, i've lived in africa i've lived in spain switzerland hong kong too, um different cultures food music rituals, uh, everything the smells the colors, makes you feel alive, excuse me, one of my trips, uh i lived in kenya for about a year um i'd say, i love horseback riding so when you're, uh viewing other animals when you're, kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great, seeing red orange fall sunsets and, riding along you know uh, seeing so many animals yeah, in kenya um, probably when i went to a, a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii, and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it, tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to, enter a masai village for the first time, uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same, twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai, and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be, uh, some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed, my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets, and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living, getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah, i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen, uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go, achieve it sometimes um i believe that, um, usually i well i make decisions very quickly, and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker, and i told him i said well in each case, you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's, hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one, and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy, mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure, even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time, and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy, uh pardon, you said you put your fish, what do i do when i'm annoyed, um <sigh>, <tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um, i guess you really have to put yourself, in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy, um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're, put in other situations where you're forced to, to um, understand other people's, lives a lot more regardless of how different they are, uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why, travel is really the best education there is, <sigh> let me think um, last time i argued about, something um, god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um, oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something, um, uh <sigh>, oh i know what it was um, it was somebody who belonged to the uh, uh scientology faith um, i uh, inherited, i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus, and um, uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive, and um, <tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited, and um, and he said something about are you aware of, past lives and, i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that, if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them, and i and he said that are you aware that, um, <tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that, many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have, had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness, um resulting from even your past relationships or your, parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that, you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself, even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold, maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all, and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge, i take, sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would, fold down i had my boo boo, and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part, you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child, and i would actually, even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back, i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital, the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that, just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh, um, uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that, because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and, it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was, um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen, twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have, never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has, you know, so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of, somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his, uh, you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated, especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery, uh the following week, and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get, into it but, one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused, by people themselves, and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that, past lives can also affect, you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are, are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought, he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so, but um, <tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't, you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>, but other than that i mean i don't, <sigh> um, uh <sigh>, sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when, when it's in terms of patience, i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital, mm <sigh>, mm my brother, uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he, is in the medical field so my sister and i said well, you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time, but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after, you know my boss my father kept, you know um, um you know bucking the his body would actually, be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard, mm but you know it was after a while the uh, you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular, uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible, yeah it was mhm, hm, mm, i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic, that happened to me that i've, had to block them i really don't know what, it is within my makeup which, doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that, have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of, that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear, and for some reason i i feel blessed that i, don't really i can't really even think of something that, i mean i've had some, bad situations happen to me but, it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me, in affecting, you know my behavior where i would, where i block it that i'm not aware, of something or i hold residual, negativity for some reason so, i really can't think of anything i mean, there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to, block them 'cause i've been able to, you know um, accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened, pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just, kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so, i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but, say like if i'm in africa and i, <tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my, elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem, okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh, have i ever studied <s> studied what, uh i could still couldn't hear you i'm sorry, have i ever studied changes <ch> changes in my behavior what was the word, um no, uh uh, um <sigh> i don't know just with friends and everything just even this, past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music, regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about, mm, you know it's funny, uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been, uh, um, opened up experiences that are, that are also great that i have not, overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner, to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and, sometimes people sat to me like, are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or, are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was, you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even, more difficult in a way um and uh, he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved, uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um, <tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business, i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why, i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see, the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten, to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g>, german, uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off, but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed, during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life, uh, a different world that, that would you know that i would've never, um had the chance, you know to, live through if i had not involved my, you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who, you know money isn't everything and, i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so, there you go, <laughter> and for example one of my favorite, times in my life probably when i lived in kenya, and you would think that, you know a lot of people have this, really bad vision of it maybe looking living, in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of, uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have, you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best, years of my life when i was living in kenya, the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen, um, to, live your life with passion, and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about, making decisions, you have to make those decisions gut wise, what will, give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy, and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield, you know the happiness in your life, <tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and, follow my, passions and, you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually, decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is, sure, bye",0
329,"yes, pretty well, from new york, uh to go to college well to san diego to go to college and then later to l_a, aerospace engineering, um it was i was really good at math and science and i had a interest in airplanes, no, i'm a life coach, uh to be a life coach and help people, um i really really like uh how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that i made a contribution to their life , um i like the weather it's it's great 'cause i really like to do outdoor things and i like uh doing things by the ocean, traffic <laughter> and how crowded it is, yeah, um i like i live with my girlfriend and so i like it , uh we met on e harmony, uh really close, um my meditation teacher, um yeah i i used to be very shy and self conscious and had a lot of anxiety and um i'd worry a lot about the future and uh i took classes in meditation and yoga classes and uh it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more , uh meditate and do yoga, um let's see really mad um , i guess i don't know about mad i don't get mad that often but frustrated uh i would say like being stuck in traffic or um people that do mean things to other people for no real reason , um, i usually if it's i usually talk to somebody about it if i can or if i can't then i'll usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go , uh pretty good at controlling my temper, uh with my girlfriend and it was about um she was driving on the freeway and uh i suggested that she get over 'cause there was some road workers on the side and she like refused to do that and stayed in the the right lane so we argued a bit about that , uh it felt like she wasn't listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what i suggested to be defiant , um no, um rollerblade kayak uh sing i sing in a choir , um a trip i took to india and nepal for six weeks, yeah as much as i can <laughter>, uh i really i love to explore i've i've loved to explore ever since i was a little kid and so i love you know seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures and i love backpacking in the wilderness and you know exploring nature , cool um well i went on a a trip to india and nepal it's my first time ever there um first week and a half i was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat and went white water rafting on the ganga river and then um i went off on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking in nepal uh with a guide there and uh it was just really beautiful um in the anapurna area and then i went to uh back into india and explored um the area up near tibet and then uh went to uh rajasthan and to uh tiger park in madhya pradesh and was like really close to tigers, um there i uh was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this this trip and i'd always wanted to go to india so i decided to do it , yeah it was it was really fun, um caring and uh enthusatic for life, no, no, no, um pretty easy uh i don't sleep as well as i did when i was younger but for the most part i i sleep well once in a while i'll wake up you know at like four in the morning or five in the morning when i want to sleep 'till seven and not be able to get back to sleep but um in general it's pretty good, uh i feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes wanna take a nap you know in the afternoon, um no , um ten or twenty years ago, um i guess to i i wish i would have invested money or bought like a house or something when i was younger um that would probably be the advice i would give myself , um i am empathetic with other people um positive and kind of have a positive outlook on life um very determined when i decide to do something uh i'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging um i'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things i guess probably the strongest thing is that i'm pretty balanced i'm very organized but i'm also pretty creative so um pretty balanced that way , um pretty close uh much closer than i was when i was younger um and although i'd say i'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than i'm able to get to my family , uh being outdoors in nature and exercising, and also singing, um the fact that i've gone with followed my heart and did what i wanted to do versus gong with what i think i should do, um i guess yesterday i was i spent the day by the beach and just uh bicycled and went skating and um visited some old friends there, um felt very relaxed and uh invigurated and um uh i also felt like i miss living by the beach because i used to live really close to the beach , so i guess i was a little bit sad that i didn't live there anymore but uh really happy to be there, goodbye",1
372,"yes, um, pretty good kind of, <laughter> yeah, about los angeles, yes, the thing i like about l_a the weather, it's not easy to meet people, well it just feels like, people aren't out very much they're like that movie in crash where people are just sit in their cars all the time, um it feels like that, no, not too much, child development, well i have a son and, i wanted to know how to be a a good mom and so i wanted to know, about the stages uh that he would be going through, eh and be able to relate better to him, mhm, i am, kind of i'm trying to get it started again in the fall, i'd like to write, well, um i've written some children's books, and, i've just been doing research looking, into getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but, they're, pretty good i've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups, <laughter> it's about, a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries, to not become a jerk with them, and <laughter> it puts him in like a really, , he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life, mhm, um no, i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter>, um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing, i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter>, so, how do i cope, um <sigh>, well right now, um, i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so, that was the problem, it's so spontaneous, like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and, just brings a smile to your face, um, well when my son was younger, once we were just sitting around the house and, he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me, mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails, so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so, yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen, that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore, the hardest thing <sigh>, not wanting to screw it up, i feel a lot of stress and pressure, that, every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter, in what kind of person my kid turns out to be, and, so, it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>, yeah, yeah, definitely, um, hmm, i think, i'm different from my mom, because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction, i welcome it you know i welcome, getting to know who my child is right now, and, not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just, see them become the best, child that they can be the best adult that they can be without, molding them in that direction necessarily, into a different person <laughter>, so, say it again, who's someone that's a positive influence, um <sigh>, mm, i don't really have anybody, like that, okay, well, i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it, often enough, um, i've tried, to like go for walks but i don't always do that, and i don't always stick with it, so, yeah that's about it, i'd say, i'm, a little below average meaning, that i get angry, more than most people do i think, hmm, last night, <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband, um we have my sister lives with us, and she lives with us in a very small room with, a small apartment i should say, and she's got four people living in in one room so um, it's kind of stressful it's really crowded, and my husband is stressed out about it, and, you know i'm just saying to him that, i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here, then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do, that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded, and every day they're asking for rides and my husband, he's, avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore, and i'm just saying that, he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because, he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter>, hmm, it does <laughter>, oh, i've got tons of 'em but right now, what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son, um, right now like, i've been arguing with my stepmom, and, my stepsister for a long time about, my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated, like they don't have any boundaries, and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child, they let my child boss 'em around and stuff, anyways because of this, they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that, yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom, because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different, ideas about child raising, she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife, and, she's, she really doesn't she's really far removed from, how i was raised and i wanna raise my child, more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us, and, with my stepmom she no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild, and have everything that he wants, and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes, and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules, and not, trying to go and break all of my rules, yeah, um in that moment <sigh>, just really frustrated because they don't listen to me, i feel, disrespected i feel, like invisible, i feel, just angry, that, they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do, i went to school and i studied child development, i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>, i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities, and, to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent, try and tell me that i'm a bad parent, it's really, uh, hard to believe so i feel very disrespected, um, unacknowledged angry frustrated, all those things <laughter>, um, i take i take benadryl to help me sleep, and i'm, so, <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep, and last night i was crying, before i went to sleep, so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed, but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily, yeah i'm always thinking about my son, how i wish he was with me, and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle>, and like i don't deserve, to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom, you know, and i'm too hard on myself so, but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom, i just, i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me, and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because, i know he can do more for him, financially than i could, but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom, hmm, i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants, um, i take wellbutrin, i been on them for a couple weeks now, i think they're working i don't know, i'm not as, down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so, not that bad, um <sigh> hmm, my husband complains a lot he says, i'm not the same person, that i was when he married me, he said i was fun and i was positive and, i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle>, and, i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago, and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such, a shock, and um, i've just been trying to get back from it, but it's been hard, did i think i had a problem before i found out, found out what, oh, um, yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but, like um, my family would invite me, to family events, and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle>, or um, i don't know, it's just all the crying i think, and like i said my husband, letting me know that i'm not the same person, so, he's disappointed, and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too, another thing i'm feeling bad about, you know, yes i do i try, do i feel like the therapy's useful, um, yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week, so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter>, um, that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards, um, yeah, and she helps me make decisions you know, help me to be more proactive in my life, um, well, i'm looking for, jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that, you know and then she said something about, why don't you go back to school and, so i went and applied to go back to school, you know i'm not doing, much with my life and, sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either, so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college, in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills, so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas, that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing, with life life yeah, everything's always, bittersweet, um, i don't know, last time i was really happy, i don't know <laughter>, my ideal weekend, oh, i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent, reading maybe, but i can't really, i, i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um, but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading, something i've read, , okay, i like to go to u_s_c, they have these nights where, they have things like book signings or poetry and art it's called visions and voices, so i like to go out to <t> to their events, and i usually enjoy those, um, about two weeks ago, um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for, a discovery of witches, and so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings, and see what it's like to be an author who's, talking to a crowd and signing books <laughter>, my son, i don't have any friends, my best qualities, um, i'm smart, i'm good-looking, um, i'm really um, and like a hard worker, i i'm dedicated to like self-improvement, um, that's all i can think of right now <laughter>, okay, okay, goodbye, press the buzzer now",13
413,"yes, i'm doing okay, i'm from greenwich connecticut, yes, um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago, um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less, um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general, um, i think that, other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there, are just more my, type and what i'm used to and, it's less superficial, <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california, um initially it was easy because i felt like, it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just, are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in, how different it is and, what life is out here it became more difficult than originally, uh fine arts and photography, um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and, got awards and things like that and publishments, so i decided to pursue art, um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and, , yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um, i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography, i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting, um, that's a interesting question, i guess just my childhood in general, growing up, um well my family's very close, um, my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live, within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that, yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is, more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries, um i consider myself more shy, um, i, watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted, um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and, just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to, um, i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having, if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger, um, well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like, insignificant things, but other than that, um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago, um, there's been like some tension going on, since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter, things about his girlfriend and, he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to, have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways, so for like the thirtieth time he, we were on the phone and he was, <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and, he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i, i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me, um, i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish, that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue, but the thing is is that he says, certain things that are untrue, or things he knows that like will tick me off, that are really nasty and, that he shouldn't be saying to me so he, so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really, mm like not say anything, um, well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't, i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to, after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically, changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own, so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now, that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made, um, well i wish i could erase, the event or seeing, my grandmother's funeral which, obviously it wouldn't change anything, but, it wasn't, seeing her there was not something i'd wanna, like have in my memory, um she was she was a very positive influence and always, was not judgmental, um, and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people, so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people, they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you, are older, um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep, no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m, i will be up like clockwork, by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to, figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer, no i just, in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's, i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning, <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring, but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday, um, i don't know i kind of just feel very, mm, like so so, just, no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of, one note land, i mean nothing like lately, um, like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and, just reserved and, not very outgoing, no, no i have been diagnosed with anxiety, um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital, um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but, they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety, i think in the right setting and, with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist, is helpful, and good at what they're doing then yeah, no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid, um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like, deal with whatever issues they were having with me, but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day, it wasn't, i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it, <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday, when i'm there i can always just, we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to, worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out, just enjoy the day, in general, um, i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't, being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and, the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here, so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or, you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even, that it was more like a transfer school like you, you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went, so it kind of create created more problems for me, well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago, i would give myself the advice to, probably stay closer to home, and to have, really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california, um, my best friend would describe me, as a great charismatic funny outgoing, socially enjoyable person which is different than how, people who aren't my good friends would describe me, which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i, am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just, i am very shy and, don't really, speak much, um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that, yeah, um, i'm very caring, i, i'm a very good judge of character, which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself, um, i'm very affectionate <aff>, i mean, i'm not very affectionate i'm more, i mean i guess i guess so, thanks",10
395,"yes, i'm doing fine, california here in los angeles, mhm, um i love being near the beach um i love the beach, i love um living in a big city, um, and i love the fact that i have lots of friends and family here, mm traffic, um, just so many sometimes too many people, but apart from that i i'm generally happy here, photography and language studies, mhm, um i love photography, i was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well so i wanted to continue to learn more about it, and with languages i come from a mixed background so i wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic background, it's um it wasn't hard it was a passion so i enjoyed it, i'm not no, um to do photography full time and also to do some of the things that i'm passionate about um more creatively more creative things, i have an idea i'd like to do um some <s> make some robe <r> ah like a robe line um women's robes and things like that, mhm, i have i've traveled quite a bit and i enjoy <en> i love travel, um seeing different cultures different countries um, meeting new people all of that, and the language, um i lived in greece for um <tisk>, over a year i taught english there and um <sniffle> i moved around to different parts of greece and uh really had a great time, i think um, just having my group of friends that i met there and going through with the experience with them, um i think one of my most memorable experiences was going to elafonisos in a car with everybody and um and having a just a fantastic time, yes it was, um i think i'm shy to begin with and um and as i get to know people then i'm much more outgoing, photography and language studies, <deep breath> um i just stay at home uh maybe watch a movie um, rest in bed, watching a movie in bed that's probably one of the things that i like to do to relax, i think very good <laughter>, um it was probably with my boyfriend um, uh regarding money issues, um i need to i feel guilty about not generating as much income as i need to right now, i'm having some struggles in my career right now, and um financially it's becoming very difficult, yeah it has been it's been difficult but i've been working very hard to um to remedy that <sigh>, so well i'm here and um i'm doing this this focus study i'm doing um many things to generate more money working harder but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my my career, um, probably being raped, no, no, sometimes, um not that i'm aware of, <deep breath> um i been feeling stressed <sigh> um, i been feeling um, <deep breath> been feeling stressed and and worried, i don't seem to have any problem with it <laughter> i seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night, mhm, um grumpy and and lethargic and um in the morning, hmm a situation i wish i would handle differently, um, i really can't think of one right now, <laughter> the hardest decision um that i've ever had to make, it was probably um deciding to not have a a child, well um i was pregnant um and um, wasn't sure <sigh> whether or not i should continue the pregancy um, and that was also due to financial burden and um, the father who i was involved with did not want the child so i made that very very difficult decision, hmm, i know when i went to um cancun um on a holiday um over the new year um new year period new year holiday, <deep breath> i felt <sigh> absolutely fantastic i felt happy i felt relaxed um, i felt like i didn't have a care in the world temporarily, um, eh free, um i wish i could um, be a little bit stronger and more assertive, definitely more assertive, um i would say i'm a wonderful wonderful friend, um, mm i when i love somebody you know i love them very deeply friends family um, boyfriend, um so i think that's good i'm very loyal as a friend, um i'm honest i care about people, um, i'm fun to be with so i think those are some of my best qualities, <deep breath> um my relationship with my family um with my father is not so great, um my parents were divorced when i was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever, uh mostly out, so that's um it's not fantastic but um but it's something that i'm used to so it's not, as painful as it would be had he been there and then i lost him but it's it's still it's still um, it's still not the best situation i mean i still wish that could be um remedied somehow, , so there's good and and bad relationships in my family, , someone that's been there for me since i was very very young, and has always been just incredible and i love her so much, <deep breath> um ten or twenty years ago um, i would've told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so i don't have to work so hard now, i i regret exactly that i regret um not taking my career seriously earlier on, um because now it's it's been um, it's been much harder, um, i think it was taking the kids to the pier um and spending some wonderful time with them, and making them happy, that was probably a great time um one of the best times in the last few weeks, , and uh, and they're they're great kids, um no i think the they're it's challenging, um it is more difficult because they're stepchildren so there are some um, times when i'm not sure exactly how much um to get involved and how much not to get involved, but i'm we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but um, but i but it's not as difficult as um as i think some other parents have it, mhm, um i made it make a make a conscious effort, not to um, <laughter> not to punish them um or over-punish them, i make a conscious decision not to um scream at them the way that i was screamed at i was screamed at a lot as a child, and um it was really it was really difficult so i make sure not to do that, um i think i'm most proud of the fact that i've um been able to, travel the world um, and live in other places many many other places um around the country and around the world, and um, the fact that um i learned several languages, um, and the fact that i've been able to maintain um, really long long long relationships with my friends, thank you, goodbye",7
376,"yes, i'm fine, it's still tomorrow, so.., i'm from the east coast of massachusetts, yes, i moved to l a when i was a child with my parents, pretty much had no choice in the matter <laughter>, i wasn't there the last time i was there, three years ago for christmas., um, it's very hectic, there are a lot of people who are angry., and many people are not interested in the other person here in l a, in which in the east of the east coast the thought pattern is much different you know your neighbors you are friendly to your neighbors and to everyone you see on the road, , yeah, that's good., well, since i was a kid, i was pretty young at first it was hard i was in trouble a little at school, but.., after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did well in high shcool and so and even took some college courses, um, well, i love the beach, and i love the mountains i like to walk, um and i like walking along the beach i live only a few blocks away from the beach, so it's easy, no, not at all, just not interested uh i was on mexico a few times when i was younger, went to ensenada, but except that i'm not interested in leaving the united states, especially with what has happened lately, to go abroad, around <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the care program for a little, but i had some problems at home, which caused me to get out, oh, that's all right., a the value of the goods in question shall be equal to or less than the value of the goods in question , um, i don't have any., to be honest around, i admire people who do the job they love, i mean like football players who like to play football, and they get all the money paid, how big is that <laughter>, so, i'm pretty intrusive when i meet someone first., to say, if we want to, continue to communicate with the person or not, and once i have decided that i like this person or whatever i talk a lot, so, yes, um, i like watching movies, i like reading, but lately my concentration wasn't that big, so it's hard to get into a good book, not good in times i uh i have a, some breakout every time in a while so anyway it depends on how angry i get, yesterday, and it was with my partner, and, to be honest, i don't know what it was anymore, it's just, sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate it and when i feel that i'm disrespectful or whatever i'm going to stand up for myself, so, um, sometimes some people can be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i am, what is in my mind, i don't know., deliberately go and hurt people's feelings or anything of this nature, but, i'm not being bullied and i'm not being made to not return when i feel like i'm being challenged, so, um, my mother died last year., so, i wish i could've done it differently., um, it stirs up <ups> it upsets me, so, it's okay., let me see., uh.., i think i'm going to pass this on, too, because it's getting me more upset, so <laughter>, that's sometimes awful uh sometimes actually falling asleep can be no problem, especially you know when you're done working and doing everything you had to do in a day, you're tired, but staying asleep is a completely different thing for me, because, it's like i can't uh, i get up and then i'm awake i'm going to the living room turn the t v and watch t v i'm lucky when i sleep three to four hours, maybe because i have a lot in my mind., uh you know, think about bills and, and, the stressiness of the work and then all the other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it, it's not hard, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes to overtime mode, it just affects everything your concentration your sleep your food, everything like this, i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning man <laughter>, i like the nights, but i don't like the morning, it's like leaving me alone until i get my first cup of coffee, yeah, that's good., so different from the, i'm, i'm fine., well, i was depressed., for some time, and i still have difficulties <diff> difficulty, because after my mother's death four months later my uncle died, so i've had two deaths last year, so i'm still wavering and trying to, to get back together, i'm just recently i've started to pursue like interests that i used to do, that i haven't done in a year because of what happened, um, i'm just.., i could get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat too much i eat too much, um, i get tired very easily because i don't get much sleep, so sometimes it's hard, it seems like i'm fighting to get through the day, yes, i have a psychiatrist who prescribes me medication on a regular basis., oh i was diagnosed some time ago hm probably, ten to fifteen years ago, and it's just something i never have, i don't know if or not, you can, so i've always taken the medicine., um, i was, fight with each of my family my friends and so and me, was desperate and hopeless, and i had tried to take my own life years ago, what took me to the hospital, and then uh, they started treating me, i started seeing a therapist, so, well, right now, i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance covers the psychiatrist and not the therapist., but i work with a friend of mine who <ha>, ways to go to seek help for a therapist and i don't know if this will really help me, i mean at some point it depends on what kind of therapist you sometimes just sit people there, and they just listen to you when you talk and go on and you think, my god, what's good is that?, and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback, how to deal with emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions, so, um, as i said, i didn't go to therapy recently just psychiatrists just medications, um, there were no real changes., i would probably do well because i did well before my mother died, i was her nurse, and uh, even if many times i, i felt overwhelmed or, missing <l> uh missing patience with her, uh, i was still much happier., when i am now, so, um, uh.., i'd say when my son was born years ago, i'm not a parent anymore, he died., so, um, and that was also difficult, uh, hmm, around i am extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me, because i get everything done that i should be done, although sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained, and, you know, these qualities are admirable in people who can keep their word and be responsible, excuse me., oh, i have a lot of regret for, things i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about, but you know i met someone once in my life., that had this saying and you see it on a bumper sticker, uh, live to never regret, so you know you can't go back and make changes, it's too late, so why you know you have the situation., but sometimes it's a lot easier said than done, to i'm not the advice somehow getting person <laughter> i know i don't really know, give my friends every advice i can, i find most of the times people don't listen to you, so why bother, um, i'm just saying my opinion, that's all., i'm on a diet because i ate too much., after my mother died, i was much thinner than she was alive., i just went crazy with the food and a lot of sleeping, you know that sleep eat sleep eat, and now i'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight, because it's very unhealthy for me, um, hmm, i'm trying to believe it's been a long time., actually, there's nothing, because, now i just keep my thoughts busy, i haven't been in a movie in ages, i haven't gone shopping all the time., um, so it's been a long time since it's been so long., i was content and happy with who i am and what i do in my life., around my weekends saturday <sa> uh like saturday i usually work, around sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house, um, running some errands going shopping for food, you know that., so, it's not that if i was younger, you know, it would be fun to do clubbing or whatever, but i'm too old for it now., , um, there's nothing i can imagine., there's nothing i can be proud of, hmm, um, some a good like comedy or whatever i like to see that around, sometimes my partner could do something stupid i like, 'cause i like to make fun of him, um, but mm only that's what you know, go maybe go for a walk on the beach, that's it, all right., no problem, thank you., see you.",12
444,"<sync>, yes i'm fine, i'm doing very well today, i feel good today, uh born in indiana, mhm, grew up in bloomington, i moved to l_a for a job working with the c_d_c, i've only been back twice in the past twenty years, um my family is not there anymore, uh i went back for high school reunions, it's much greener it's very green uh very small, um, uh, very um, wooded areas that's where i played in the woods when i was a a kid we'd swim in the quarries, um i rode my bicycle everywhere, and here it's a little um, more uh, cement and traffic, um, it was <wa> it just seemed, like cement at first but i love it now and i have friends and i i love, being able to do so many different things, um and i go to the beach a lot, um, i still go up to the mountains i go camping all the time, um so i i love it i love it, always opportunities, <laughter>, um i have traveled quite a bit i was in the peace corps, and i was um <tisk> in south america, i was in paraguay for three years and i traveled all through south america, brazil peru uh peru chile bolivia, um i also spent a year in london, traveled all through europe, and i used to go to canada often, uh i'd love to get to asia one of these days, uh meeting new people the food i love trying new food, um and just getting a different perspective, on the world, and different people's um outlook on the world, and because america tends to become isolated, um i hiked the inca trail, when i was in um, uh peru, and that was a five day hike, starting out of cusco, um we hiked for um i think what four or five days, um and woke up, one the last morning, at the sun gate of machu picchu, and that was just an most amazing experience 'cause i would only i'd i'd seen about i'd seen it in national geographic, you know all my life, um so to be there, and experience that was phenomenal, philosophy, i have my degree in philosophy, i minored in art, <clears throat>, well i started out in business, and i got very disenchanted with it very quickly, and so i decided to study what i wanted to study, while i was in college, and had the opportunity, so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher, um but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school, and being a professor of ethics, um but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i, ended up joining the peace corps <laughter> so it all worked out, i'm sorry, yeah mhm, i'm i'm sorry my alarm's going off on my phone it'll die in a second, okay i'm sorry, it's still going, sorry i turned off the phone but i forgot to turn off the alarm, that should go, okay what i'm sorry what was your question, my dream job, um <sigh >, gosh, um writing, um, i've done a few um, uh scripts uh some screeenplays with a friend of mine, um but i don't really wanna do the hollywood thing, um <tisk> but writing and teaching, and traveling if i could do that overseas, so, outgoing, should i turn off my alarm <laughter> it keeps going <laughter> here oh i can't move okay i can't get to my purse, okay i'm sorry, yes i i turned off my phone but i didn't turn off the the alarm is like, <laughter> it's like i forgot it's my alarm to go to yoga class, i'm terribly sorry about that <laughter> okay <laughter>, <laughter>, sorry for the interruption, um i have a actual fish tank, um at my house and i i do the the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset um the i sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing, um i also try and meditate, um i try and and just sit down and be quiet, um and gather my thoughts, um i like to read, and um or sometimes i i walk or i'll take my dog for a walk, <sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts, every once in a while, um when things are getting too chaotic, at my house um, and i'm feeling very underappreciated, i will, have a, burst of anger, yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation, but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of, um recognizing that i'm upset about it, my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad, and then that escalates and, uh, sometimes i just end up walking out the door, or going to my room, hmm, i'm sorry, um i i usually after i have an outburst, and i isolate myself for a little bit, i can come back relaxed, and deal with the situation, in a, more, calm manner, um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to, stop and and get myself out of there, and and go take some deep breaths, um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling, why i'm being angry why why am i being, um, so tense, and then be able to verbalize that, um, well i i it happens a few times when i start getting, i've had a very tense day, um and things haven't gone right, um, i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm making dinner, and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework, or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh, uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then, and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out, just let me finish dinner, and nobody would, and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up, and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to, pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there, um so that that i i should have um, walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that, um, it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child, um i wasn't married, um <tisk> i had a very good friend, um, oh i was i was, thirty two at the time, so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion, but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this, um, and i had, um, i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to, um, but we'd only been dating like three months, and i was living with, a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with, um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well, um i didn't know if we could raise a child together, i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else, um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together, um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together, um, and uh so it was a lot of, um, huge decisions, that were gonna determine the rest of my life, um, and i, made the decision based on, more common sense and practicality, um, but i don't regret that decision, i think i made a good decision, to marry my husband and, raise our child <laughter>, um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen, he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering, he is getting his pilot's license, uh which i'm very proud of him for, um then my daughter is, fifteen, and she loves acting, uh she um she has a boyfriend, who um, uh they see just once a week at church basically, um and they text each other constantly, um she's a very very typical fifteen year old, and then i have a twelve year old, he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly, um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house, so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis, no, i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't, my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young, and um my mother kind of disconnected, when that happened, um so i didn't have a very warm or loving, relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was, um kind of on my own from a very young age, um, i mean she was at the house but, really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have, parenting skills, that you know most people are are raised with, um, i know what not to do, but sometimes it's very difficult and um, i i see my friends that have you know these, very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect, um and it's like i i'm just not that person, so i i, i try and be, i'm i i think i am a very good mother, but i'm not um, a typical mother, i think i'm more, um i'm more creative, a lot of times i and we do a lot of things, um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing, actually when we go camping it's more, i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home, i think i'm more tense when i'm at home, but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become, calmer and more patient, i think my patience is what, um i need to work on the most, i'm a been an insomniac all my life, i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and, um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise, and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day, i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired, to sleep well, um and that's sometimes that's hard to do, um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading, i'll read 'til midnight, um and then i'll try and go to sleep, um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again, and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep, yesterday i didn't feel so good i was, um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday, um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden, and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard, um so i had some more planting to do, and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it, um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but today i feel really good, so i feel more positive i feel more energy, so, no, no, um, i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that, hasn't really helped me sleep, but um, it was really good because i needed one for a really long time, and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane, um but it was, you know just like, i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's, it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing, and it was like finally, uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list, um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and, uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy, <laughter> i don't know um, i think she, believes that i'm, uh, uh, more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am, at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues, uh, she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice, um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me, um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by, uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic, um or empathetic and, uh i just i'm just there to listen, and i don't need to give her any advice so, i think a a good listener and, good advice giver, i procrastinate a lot, um i start projects and i don't finish them, uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and, um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get, almost finished, and then, i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest, um, sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them, which sounds a little strange but, um, i i'm working on that, i'm trying to get those done, oh gosh <laughter> um, not following through on the opportunities i had when, i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree, um, with on a grant and things of that sort um, but instead i got pregnant and got married, and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed, um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time, where i had to fight for a directorship, and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship, and so i really wish so i resigned, um, and i wish i had stuck with that, um, 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and, solid career, um, not, base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses, um the jobs were wonderful, um, but, my ego got in the way, and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the, the, egotistical, reactions that i had, to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well, um my children actually, um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal, um and, uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that, they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl, my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started, and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day, and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it, um so that's, that was, one of my prouder, experiences, okay, thank you, bye",7
309,"<laughter>, <laughter> yeah <laughter>, <laughter> i'm doing good , <laughter>, uh arizona, uh because of acting and other stuff like that entertain <entertai> enterainment industry, no, not at the moment at least, um currently <curr> uh currently a student, uh i produce hip hop, uh, well i rap and produce hip hop, i play video games, and then hang out with people, no, not very good i break things , uh on the way over here my mom and how to get here, the beach, <laughter> it's a fucking computer dude, uh no, the last place i went was los cabos <cabo> no, not los cabos uh, fuck where'd i go, somewhere in mexico, no, no, yes, uh like, four years ago, right now no, lately not very easy, no just lately, uh, well my wife left like three weeks ago and after that i haven't been able to sleep, uh, i don't know i just bury me head in stuff, i don't know i just do stuff, i try to keep my mind off of it like do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything, i don't have i never went to therapy, wait no i did go to therapy, like three four years ago, 'cause i went to a separate therapist, but then i went to a, a thing where i they they did a bunch of uh cognitive tests <te> tests and memory tests and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time like i get depressed and it last for months on end, yeah uh, to be honest i don't know, i think it's more about like you focusing on yourself and like, i don't know i don't know how to explain that it's like you have to figure out things within yourself you don't need someone else to talk to, well originally when i went to a therapist i was court ordered now i wanna go to therapy for my anger management though, i don't know what the fuck, <laughter>, i mean my wife left like three weeks ago so yes, <laughter>, uh it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done so yeah, well considering i'm only nineteen if i could go back nineteen years i would say not to fuck up, and let myself get depressed about certain things that would've drove away my wife, and not to be angry, yeah driving away my wife <laughter>, yes many many things every day <d> every day, well i could've not broken stuff, and i could've uh, stopped uh, like i was basically blocking out the external universe and i was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that i don't focus on the real life i was basically escaping and so in that sense i wasn't paying attention to her and that's basically why she left, i mean that and being angry, 'cause like, both contributed their own proportion, their own portion, earlier today, uh, i mean i feel really happy all the time and then it just like goes away it's like back and forth like one day i'll one second i'll be really happy and then another second i'll be really sad 'cause i'll think about something again and it's like i gotta keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think and, i don't really know how to explain it it's just something you feel, no, <laughter> you need better programming, <laughter>, <laughter>, uh, silly, uh i'm creative, uh uh potential of intelligence , i'm charming i'm loving, at some points i'm all of those things, some points i'm not, doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around, my hip hop, i mean kid travelier, you need better programming, <laughter> kid travelier is my friend , to be a hip hop artist , i don't know i just thought it one day, not hard anymore i mean it was hard while i was practicing when i was younger when i was like eleven or twelve now it's just easy, i'm still in school, no problem, yeah have a nice day, bye bye",15
471,", yes, i'm fine, thank you., from los <l> los narrowes, mm sports outdoors, surfing uh snowboarding mountain biking climbing, transport, yes, experience different cultures, i love going to mexico., and uh anyway it's so much different from california and western culture, so to say, mexico is a western civilization, but, the height of the, entertainment and level of education is so much different that they are like two different worlds, traveling you mean, uh, i would have to say to go to an island off the coast of figi, the name is tavarua, and it is a very small island around which you can walk in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes, and it's a place where you go to surf and it's an incredible, uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place, i've studied biology, i was pushed from behind by my father, who was a doctor, and he wanted me to be a doctor., i don't work at all in, business units now, yes, i am., my dream job would be to be a missionary, yes, the original goal of my father, when he became an m d, was to become a missionary and he is a very, generous person and i think i'm also i got that from him uh hereditary, but i'd like to help people, and i don't think a doctor helps people, i really don't think it's insincere to say that you help people while you stuff wads of money in your pocket., i'd like to build uh people houses and help them find freshwater springs things like this if i could afford to travel to remote places like this, i'm practicing, i think i'm pretty good at it uh, i think i'm pretty effective at that., it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend, and it was about their lack of consideration, um, i felt frustrated, hmm, a situation which , i wish i could handle it differently., i anyway in my later years i would say anyway i didn't have many regrets in my younger years i uh, people are sniffed and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i wouldn't express my dissatisfaction about their actions or behavior, i would just close my mouth and internalize my feelings that i learned that, it's so wrong, and so, in the probably last fifteen to twenty years i have made it to a point to my vocalize, dissatisfaction with someone's actions immediately and that, uh takes care of the anger right away, yeah, it depends on what you mean with trouble, uh i think, anyway all the way around as soon as you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end, it diffuses the problems rather than, prolonged or delayed the disturbance, i go back it would be not to pursue uh medicine as my father wanted us to argue, length for many, months and years over this and uh finally i've overwhelmed and uh i don't go, i didn't go on this route, but that was probably the most.., uh difficult period, in my life, mm there was a time when i wish i could erase a female interaction uh friends and their, uh betrayal uh but now i realize that, keeping these memories makes me who i am today and, and dealing with them defines who i am today, uh my parents died i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very grateful for the, although my father was a little bit a uh, hard hand uh, and draconian < laughter> person uh we came to an understanding long before he died, and uh my brothers i get along well with my younger brother, but my older brother has problems he has uh psychological problems and she continues to plague and influence him, me, too., just knowing he's going through uh turbulence, well, i guess i can't handle it because.., he's clinically depressed., and he has suicidal tendencies, and he doesn't work, he's very educated., and he's not talking to me., and his family abuses him very much, it's a not happy relationship for his family, yes, you know, i'd have to say my father's my hero, he's my model., he's my archetype for what a man was supposed to be, and he was inconspicuously honest., and kind,, but on the other hand he had high expectations of me and my two brothers., eh normally, once my head hits the pillow i'm dead sleeping like a tree trunk, but lately i just uh last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two, and i feel it's because of a cancer diagnosis i received a month ago, um, i using my own personal uh methods of dealing with stress, i'm okay i'm probably 90 percent okay, ten percent of uncertainty about the future, on the question of whether , i'm gonna survive this or not, not really, no, never, never, oh i was either surfing or snowboarding, or climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i train at a very high level of effort, funny, jovial, uh uh intelligent a perfectionist, no one asked me that., maybe, will my uh submerge, hedonistic self, i look at myself again, my father fills my consciousness, he was the ultimate.., uh postponer of satisfaction, he, set, now behind him and he put what will be in the future, in his eyes, and he never let go of it, and that made him the self made man he was., considering that i am always looking for the present, how i feel now and it's difficult for me,, uh slog through a mile full of uh shit to get at a price that's so far away, < deep breath> it would be, my ex boss, and he started using me on my last day of work when he fired me, he started using me, i turned to him and i said you can't talk to me like that., and he continued to use more profanity, to uh, i spoke out against it again, and then he fired me, and that's still in my head, and that's what happened., a year and a half ago, mhm, everything i regret uh yes i don't regret getting married and having children, i suppose i could, but i think that, that would have taken away the many opportunities i had, and i took to travel the world and experience different cultures because, that's what i enjoy most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my consciousness, for the united states are not the end of the world, but only when one can travel can one find out that we are not., we have not been going to, uh level of uh life around the world other people think that we're the only ones who think that and i don't agree, mm, that's a good one i'd say, <laughter> i'd say just enjoying life because you never know when it's coming to an end and i think i've done that, and uh i could come to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so, i think i've done it, i'm so happy with my life, i, has been, climbing lessons i have a uh part time task of teaching climbing, and many of these people have never done it before, and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this could have changed their lives so, that was very gratifying to me, < deep breath>, i would say <sigh> my, devotion to, environment, i wasn't always an environmentalist, but.., i used myself vocally for being an ahem., uh, a steward., the environment, because today they are a lot of people who, environmental pollution with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septically uh things like this and, i get up and i've been talking on t v and on uh youtube against these people who pollute the environment, you're welcome., goodbye.",0
465,", yeah, that's good., cool, i'm hanging out, you know, on an adventure chilling, culver city california, yeah, that's right., all the different microcosms and different places and peoples and scenes and things you know that it is very large, it's crazy., i don't know., i can't have mine., of course there are a few things i could say, but uh, i don't know, i mean i like l a i even like the bad that you know it's just part of the experience in general you know, < slaughter>, yeah, i've been all over the country., a bunch, uh again it's like going to another world, it's like quantum leap that i can transport to a completely different realm of people, and uh you know you're learning about her and hanging out and, drink beer and smoke grass and write and, rape and rape, do drugs and hang out more and, all kinds of shit man it's crazy, < slaughter>, oh, really., oh okay um, yo i recently went to san francisco, and i was there for like eight days i rushed at this house party in san jose really fast, then i went to davis did the same, i took the train cooled in san francisco hung with some of my middle school friends for hell long, then uh yeah it was crazy i was just walking usually i ride a bike everywhere but i was just like walking, this all the time and, it was cool i was crazy exploring, i was going to i came back home finally then after that i went straight to texas, and made some shows on the way to texas and stayed there for eight days, and that was it was knarr, it was crazy, i don't even know, man, there was so much that you know i had fun., i went to this place, the salt sea., and me some of my bike friends we around <sniffle>, we got into cars and went far out into the desert and we around, yes, it was tight, we burned things, we burned a car, we drove the car it was like a street warrior type of car, and it was it crazy man, like it was like fifteen niggers on a car, like we went naked into a creek., i have h lla shrooms did h lla molly, a ridiculous amount of grass smoked, was left behind drunk, someone wanted to give me some mescaline i didn't want, but it was like march., before i went on the other trip that was like the forerunner, to my other trip it was the salton seafaring, but yes, it was tight, i saw a lot of nudity this trip, yeah, really., i'm fucking absent., going out for safe, smoke herb, < slaughter>, what did i study?, um, um.., oh i studied <laughter> about photography and photojournalism, and uh, yeah, yeah, that's it., must use the computer free of charge, must use baller ass cameras for free, and i would just a little uh i would do man on the street kind of shit with students not man on the street, but the where you take her picture and it's like, i forgot what they said it was a long time ago., not anymore., this, being me and just hanging out, i rape what i do., i do small shows all over the country and i have a little fan base, and i'm just always you know, just do that only art i draw, my dream job is not working a job and am i, this is the dream job of getting paid for me., well, that's it., i'm pretty good., like two weeks ago i was at this after hours, one i was already like super drunk and two it was after hours, three it was like after hours, man i had some pens, these guys took away my pens < clears throat> pens in my like fanny pack i had like a fanny pack, so i had pens in there because i'm doing art, he's how close dog you can't record this and i'm like, all right., i'll just leave her here and i'll get her when i get out and he was fine., i'm coming out and they're gone, accidentally overturning a beer, and he gets mad at me, he's like you have to go now, and i'm like it's not my fault, that's your fault, but then, but then, while that happened, my homie was attacked by these three great old security guards, and then you know when i saw them attacking my friend when i really lost him., and i and he and i should rather let go of my friend now, he's like what you're going to do, and i'm like what you're going to do and then how he threw me to the ground, then i and no, he had his arm over me, i put my arm over him and threw him on the ground and then it was broken, but that was the last time, i got angry., it was cool it was fun, life, you know, huh i made <gibberish>, perhaps this situation could have been handled differently., it could have been handled differently if they had handled things differently, then i wouldn't have to react., it's not like i was angry that i was distracting from the reaction that i had to react like that., because like justice, like i couldn't, it was unjust, it was like, i'm not a mean person at all, but when i saw, one of my loved ones being attacked i had to come, and how you know how to react that, and they were the hot ones, you know what i mean, i was like yo ye niggas tripping like yo, chill out this is a tiny little white guy, you're a huge mexican nigga, like you're falling back., you know what i mean, it was crazy., < slaughter>, guilty, i don't know that when i'm hungry, i'm gonna steal shit from business., when i don't have money, i guess i'm not really guilty because i don't really know, yes i don't feel guilty about, food should be free, know what i mean, but.., yeah, i don't know., i lie i guess i lie <l> everyone lies sometimes i lie sometimes, perhaps a little bit as idle here and there exaggerations, okay <ok>, nah nah never, the toughest, i guess.., i don't really know what the toughest decision was, but i get confronted with tough decisions, and that would be like, i have so many friends sometimes, i can't really hang out with everyone on a weekend, so it's like i have to make decisions, like i'm going through this sector of the city., i'm going to hang out with x y z niggas when i go over here x y z niggas so it's like, hard, you know., these are tough decisions because i never let anyone down., so uh yeah stuff like the decision to hang between friends with, ouch, it's cool that i live with my mom., i come home like every three to four days, so i am, who, what can you repeat the question, um, my aunt, oh, she's just very nice, she's like a little blind old lady., that cooks really good, and it's tight i don't know, something i could erase from my memory, i wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory, 'cause it's gonna be like, because how, the experiences you're going through make you who you are, i think weak people want to delete things or block things like, there's no way, i mean, there's shit that was tough., but i would never say i wouldn't want this to happen, because you know you have to learn from experience that you know i want to make you better., all this shit is like a test you know., this bad experience is just a test you have to overcome, and be stronger and not like curls on and be like oh my god life is hard oh, you know that shit's for weak people., i don't believe in it., i have compassion for people who, who want to do something like that, but i still like it, i don't see logic in it, mm, i mean, i stay up pretty late doing all kinds of reckless ass shit so uh, but when i'm home, and it's pretty easy, i could just go to sleep, you know, when i get tired, i get tired, yeah, that's good., lately i've been on this as i've been celebrating hell hard lately like oh my god for at least six days, how to come today to do this conversation with you, was the first time that i was able to come back to the qualer city since as friday, because i was in town and then it was like cinco de mayo, and it was like you knew random ass parties i went to with buddies., smoking ridiculous amounts of cigarettes drinking beer, shit, made some mollys., shit, made some coke., shit was crazy yo it was just like uh, it was a rock star weekend, or one week, or, type of material, this is post traumatic stress syndrome., no i didn't, i have not been going on, but i'm getting, oh i mean shoot saturday i was hella happy, < slaughter>, it was great., but i was under the influence so, but it was still great you know i was crazy empathic, for example , crazy like a flirty, mm i was freestyling like a g i was like kicking hella rimes <sniffle>, it was dope you know., analyze my life realized some things i'm going to change about my life and uh yeah it was i had a ball it was great, it was awesome i < >, oh, yeah, that's it., no, i didn't even have a crazy comedown., i'm like i'm cool, i definitely won a few pounds from last week i've drunk a lot of beer i feel a little foreign, but except that, it's me., ready, it's okay., i don't know how a lovable guy, people love me man they like me not they love me, and this shit is crazy, i'm just trying to be happy, i'm trying to make people happy, and you just know,, its really posi core, as you have said, how this is hella positive <p> positive you know, man i really don't wish i could think i'd lose weight i think it's about, but except that i mean that i ride a bike every day like my legs are pretty strong, maybe i'd just get more buff in my arm, but that's the only thing i would change and i don't really <r> i'm not really in a hurry to change that, like if that happens just living through me and i ride a bike more, then yes cool, but i don't know <n> i'm not you know abrupt change i don't need, i'm sure my gradual change, but i'm not i don't know yes, i wouldn't change anything, but if i was, but really nothing, because i'm chilling right now, uh, i don't know that i broke up with something like that., in august that felt bad about me i think, and yes, it was just someone i wanted to go out with, but they just broke up with me and like this shit sucks., but that was probably the last time i felt really bad <cough>, what exactly do you want to know about it?, oh, how.., i don't know that we just went out and then she was just fucking jealous and sometimes walked through my cell phone accusing me of shit, but then she ended up with me, just because she wanted to snoop around with other people., and that was the relationship at a glance, life sucks, you have to adapt and change the man., know what i mean, don't walk away from it and walk to what you said., yeah, that bitch gave me s t ds shit, that's the only thing i regret, yeah, man, it's a cold game, but i got the shot it was cool i'm like boom clean, but so is it., i don't know that she's a cool person we're still hanging out with., you know, she loses further i'll just keep winning know what i mean, do not run away from him, do not run to him, know what i mean, < slaughter>, wait wait ten or twenty years ago, i was only seven years old you what i say my seven year old self, he wouldn't be able to understand the advice i'd give, what did you say?, oh yeah he wouldn't be able to understand the advice i'd give him, i'd be like, just to fuck, read a little more books or something guy like, uh, i don't know, man fucking it's gonna be okay, you're you, you're great, just hold, you do cool shit and you have a ball, i don't know., i don't know., i wouldn't want to change, and that's why i'm saying that., because, if i told my young self to do something else, i wouldn't have grown into the person i'm now, even being able to say something to my young self, if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all the shit are real and time travel you know, everything i do in the past, will, this life would be a variable now, so i'm going back there, tell him to do something differently, the course of the story and then the time stream that i may

make hellish mistakes you know, at least the, at least that's like my ruthless state of mind like you when you screw it up, because you'll learn more from it, you know they say what they say, around experience is the best professor, you know what i'm saying, that's basically what this is, how i think you know what i mean., < sniffle>, i'm proud of this life that i'm here to do things like this <laughter>, like i'm so excited, i was all over the country, i was on people's albums., i write i do voiceover work from time to time, and yes i people know me i rap i ride bikes, i've infiltrated several, i subculture my subcultures and types of people in the city, , and i don't know, man., i guess it's like i'm living my life like i'm running for mayor, but i'm not really running for mayor, i'm just to be the best i can be, so i kiss my hands and shake babies on the way and it was a great time, and it could only become bigger and better, < sniffle>, are you sure?, woah, this is crazy.,

396,"yes, okay, virginia, i wanted to live somewhere different than virginia with a little bit more diversity, um once a year maybe, it's um, it's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there, um i wanted to live somewhere different and, a nicer warmer climate and um somewhere where there's a lot more to do and, there's a lot more going on, for me it was really easy 'cause i wanted something <someth> it was very different and i wanted something different, i like um, i like all the things to do like the museums i like, the beaches and the mountains and all the, hiking and all the free things to do, mm people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and wanna take something but they don't wanna give anything back and, bad drivers, uh not as much as i would like to i, travel whenever i can but usually can't afford to that much, mm, well i like taking, i like taking pictures a lot and i just like, exploring new places my wife and i like to see um, wildlife and hike and, monuments and just seeing different areas, um, well <sigh> we, we've gone <go> we went to uh central california we'd like to be able to go, more internationally places but that takes awhile to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to, um, we went to hurst castle and to see the sea lions <li> the um, the, elephant seals and things like that, um, i guess our uh, i guess our palm springs trip for our anniversary we did the um, eh we did the tram and a nice hotel and jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall, i guess somewhere in between, english and film, well i uh, was told i needed to go to college and i hadn't quite decided what to do yet so i just, picked something i liked to do for the time being, well, wish i'd, not been pressured so i had more time to figure out what i wanted to i might've done something different like physical therapy but, uh no i've been teaching <t> teaching gymnastics which is something i used to do before, um, i needed to not starve, and, i did it i didn't end up being as bad as i thought it would be so i went for it and it ended up being kinda fun, dream is to have money and not have to work for it, overall pretty good, um, don't remember what about but it probably would've been, few weeks ago with my wife, um well anyone that i've ever actually gotten upset and, yelled i always wish i wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy, um you know if i just, saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset, um <sigh>, i don't know i, i spend a lot of time on 'em but, i don't i don't know what the hardest one is 'cause eh if i decide to go with something it's you know it's usually for a good reason, well i guess i feel guilty about moving to california and that i left my family in virginia, i mean, <pft> i know i shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like, living there you know i'm the one that moved away so it's like i abandoned them, well i mean, i don't miss virginia but i do miss them so i guess a little hard, uh i have a good relationship with my <deep breath> with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's, no problems everyone gets along well, mm very close, um, i mean anything <anyth> anything where someone gets hurt either uh physically or otherwise, it depends on how much exercise i have, get a lot of exercise it's pretty easy if i don't it's not, um, kind of like right now just a little bit, slow and out of it but, not really um, too different otherwise, um just kinda run down 'cause my um, my mother-in-law is is dying and we just spent like three days, uh in the hospital and we're gonna go back after this so not a lot of time to, sleep, mm, just um, just uh slower <sl> just slower and, more tired and, little more out of it that's all, no, no, um, usually just when i'm having <havi>, having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's that's pretty easy for me just getting outside and, and uh and hiking or exercising it's not hard for me, i'm not sure maybe um, maybe, mm like, eccentric but in a good way, hopefully, no, um, to, be careful with your, to be careful with your, job to make sure you could keep from being injured and to um, i don't know just your <y> just your normal, your normal kind of, uh older kinda wisdom <sigh>, mm not much to say really everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger, uh i wish i could get rid of my back injury so i could get back into shape like i used to be, that's um, the biggest thing right now, um, not much to say just hurt my back at work and, i just like to get past it 'cause it's, you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all, um well like i used to do uh gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now i can only work out a little bit 'cause it hurts too much, um, probably like during the, during the day going <sigh> going on a hike or to a park with my wife and, uh, enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then, at night um you know we watch a movie or go dancing or, just something like that, um, most proud of um, proud of moving here i mean i um came here without knowing anyone and, i was at a point where i could've stayed in virginia and gotten comfortable and, you know ended up doing something i regretted but i came out and i've always thought that was a good decision, mm, my parents my grandparents my wife most people in my life have been, bye bye",5
478,", yes, thank you., the east coast, for work, very rare, i prefer it out here., it's not as beautiful as the lifestyle out here, i like the weather better and uh just a lot of things about life here, it's my favorite city, so, uh, a little.., but i mostly, what's that?, um, just.., i like to go to france, i like the food there and, it's just the lifestyle, the shopping, that's what it is., uh art history and marketing, um, um.., i was interested in high school, and i thought it was a good.., classic education uh and, um, i interned with andy warhol's magazine when i was in high school and so, the, , hmm, yes, yes, uh, oh, i'm pretty happy with what i do i do to advise so, i write marketing plans this kind of thing, um, it can be pretty hard., on the writing of a marketing plan, um, uh, i don't know that it's hard to talk to someone who's not in marketing, it just requires, in order to gain knowledge of , uh, you know how it is made and it takes several months to do such a thing., um, well, i guess i'm a little shy originally, but, um, i'm getting more and more out, just because of work and stuff., um, i like to train uh i, i walk with my dogs, we go up and down a hill a few times it is, good, uh, i don't remember., um, i don't know i can't think of anything., mm, sometimes i don't clean my car, it could get lots of dog hair in it and i feel bad if i should always stay on it just to wash to the car and so, uh, well, i had a conflict with my brother, and so i had to decide to have an alienation from him and that makes the greatest sense and that was a bit difficult, decision, but just because of his angry behavior, it wasn't that difficult, but.., it was a bit difficult because i loved him very much., um, i'm not near my family., um, but i don't really have one, i've got a, a japanese friend uh oh i think the sensor came from i have a japanese friend i'm uh very close to her is like my kind of my mom, and, , uh, i just met her socially., , i don't know i can't think of anything., <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, to be fairly simple because i keep a regular schedule, just a little tired maybe a little irritable, uh, good., well, i recover from p t s d, i sometimes feel the p t s d and then i take a medicine for it., no, it's just.., it's only left of which i'm still <sti> i still have the stress of him i'm still being treated for, it i don't really have any, i'd rather not talk about it., to be in the past, but it will be treated, um, five years ago, uh i was i was just very sad very depressed and so uh i was scared too, so i went to, to the doctor and around them helped me, and i have uh psychotherapy, yeah for the p t s d though, um, i don't know, i guess uh, it's just.., just kind of supportive, because because of the problems i have with my family, it's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and, you know, it just gives me good feedback and helps me make good decisions, this kind of thing., i sometimes have nightmares about my family, yes, thank you., oh uh i just try to get better sleep i before i go to sleep i somehow, how to, meditate a little to be calm and then hope that this will help, i feel happy all the time pretty much like i make my dogs make me happy and you know my life is really happy so, mhm, i guess you know as a nice person that i'm thoughtful., to make a good friend around <sigh>, and happy fun person, um, i don't know, i mean, i'm in my forties now, so i'm pretty happy with myself, my <m> you know mine around, you know, uh, i've done a lot of work on myself in therapy and stuff, so i'm pretty, i wouldn't really change much, i'm pretty happy with myself, i don't sound imaginable, but i'm pretty much, now happy with me, that would be about my parents who abuse them very much., i don't talk to them anymore, so <laughter> about everyone you know, if you know them, you know that they.., you know that said <sai> did terrible things to me so, i'd rather not talk about it., let's see., um, well, i just started reading a book i like to read cookbooks and i just read a book called um when french women cook and it's about, uh, a woman relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and that and the kitchen and so i'm really enjoying that book, mhm, um, i usually know you to get the grocery that i enjoy i really like to do the grocery i go to a few places, and clean a little and around, oh just oh relax, oh, yeah, i'd say.., to have better self esteem, because i used to have very low self esteem, which one knows of abuse and so, you know, i wish i was happier in the past and you know it took me a long time to be happy because, to you know no matter what i did no matter what i did no matter what i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know fighting with, being depressed, i didn't even know why, and now you know that i'm aware of it, because of whatever events it was, that it was from my parents this about a relationship and so, i mean, what the council would be, not for a relationship that, is bad for you as sometimes alienation is the best choice in an abusive relationship, um, just the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know about, i think your actions are very important and i try to treat people in a good way., and i guess you know i'm proud that you know about my work, like decisions i made., that gives me.., you know an a job i like gives me a lot, flexibility and i know i'm doing what i like and <sigh> um, and you know people like my work and, um and also my dogs i am really proud of them and, um, yes, i guess <gu> i don't know <laughter>, mhm, all right., thank you., see you.",1

one of those trips to texas, where we spend time in the desert shooting guns and karts and stuff., <laughter> it was, let's see.., my father and i are uh, are not really talking so much and uh my mom died about two months ago, thank you., definitely shyer i've always been so, uh.., just the personality i've grown into, but, learn how to adapt to and grow out of sensibility, oh, tea and.., you know, i like to eat, i mean, it calms me down., um, um.., not so good when i'm really upset it's usually a problem and i have to work to calm down and sometimes i just, don't, deal with something and i won't stop., sometimes but i have learned to control it to this extent now, <laughter> yesterday, i was arguing about what kind of water we should drink., uh good a difference of opinion and i felt as if my opinion was very valid, um, although the opinion of the other party was something, misinformed, every day is a growing process, i wish i had treated everything differently every day., to make me grow and i, trying to work how i wanted to deal with things every day, gradually, to <sigh>, i can't imagine anyone right now., to <sigh>, i'd say, uh, no., support my friends so much with their, choice of occupation, i'd rather not come in <laughter>, therapy uh experts, were really inspiring in the last two months, well, they think that, the essence of all diet comes from raw fruits and vegetables and, this is true with many studies such as t colin campbell the china study and, um, the sources of information that uh are very good and i think that deserve respect based on, you know real research <laughter>, really easy, i almost got it to a science, i'm tired., consciousness, better than i have in a long time, yes, i think it's because of the change in diet and, in no way with a placebo effect that it actually know you, relaxation of toxins and things that have accumulated over, my short lifetime of, um, you know toxic choices with food and, drugs or whatever it would be, <deep breath> yes around less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and, more control over my, decisions and my wishes against what i need, something like this kind of thing, yes, yes to a certain degree, over five years ago, <sigh> lack of motivation and, basically, my symptoms were, parallel to depression, uh loss of appetite loss of motivation do not want to do anything, do not want to have any social fear at all, of uh social situations, and uh, the most important four or five, no, i think i've overcome a chapter in my life that was the doctor., um, you know, control of my health and, experimenting with drugs and i just took another route that was alternative and i started, more juicing and to just try to hear, maybe what i needed with the help of uh, internet and nutrition experts and such things, yes, uh i think therapy is useful because, without looking inward or having someone to help you with it, it is very difficult to respond to some of these problems that you may have that, will only uh resonate in the subconscious until you know it has an outbreak it basically, treatment, will help in general health and mental health, health i think, for all, last night.., i have a really great vegan uh, dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and, had passed a few of my friends and they really liked it very much and i almost converted them <laughter>, yeah, that's good., i'd say , you know i'm trying to listen to my inner consciousness more than what my brain wants me to do., how my brain likes caffeine and sugar, while you know that my body needs something other than this , is an example, it's very difficult, it's a daily process, um, i was.., dealing with money for uh a business partner and, they ended briefly and i was to blame, but it was actually my formulas of, crunching the numbers that made it short, but they he was not aware of the change that i made to the formula so, the fault was on me that i might have taken money and i automatically felt bad about it because of my, restless uh my uncertainty about changing the formula, um, no, twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to, to start eating, raw fruits and vegetables every day, as calm and, um, sadly perhaps cleverly talented, um, i really enjoyed going to uh wholesale food market in downtown engels, around <sigh> a lot of food, uh great prices you can, eat and feed an entire family for a third of the price as going to a normal supermarket, so uh i really get into a lot of fun uh teaching people, how to maybe better eat yourself especially wise and what they eat, food and.., watch a really good t v show, um, i'm insightful, i can uh, i can adapt to people., uh <sigh> i dunno i guess i'm going

hard, to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great, broadcast journalism, well it's something i'd wanted to do since i was twelve, and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream, no <laughter>, well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was, in my twenties and, it just, once i had done that work i realized that's not really what i wanted to do it was too, cut-throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me it didn't make me happy, yep <sigh>, my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries, <deep breath> well the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them, it, i used to i don't travel so much right now, i love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like, where i'm from, my favorite trip is i went to australia for my thirtieth birthday, 'cause i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday as i crossed the international date line, and i went to this really small <sigh> place up on the, uh west coast of australia called shark's bay where native dolphins live and swim, and is very isolated for the most part and i got to be there for a whole week and just really just pretty much by myself, with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you, and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world, more shy <sigh>, <deep breath> why <sigh> hmm that's a good question um, partly the first thing i think of is 'cause i've always been that way, but maybe that's an excuse i don't know um, i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people, so <sigh>, i watch t_v <sigh> a lot, or that's probably not the best alternative but it is something i do, and i also walk on the beach 'cause i live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax, <deep breath> pretty good, it depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good, <deep breath> um i don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations, but not at people directly <sigh>, i don't know if i feel guilty about anything at the moment, not sure i have one at the moment, <deep breath> noise other people's noise makes me really mad, um i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and, not considerate, about their neighbors that that just makes me really mad <sigh>, yeah <sigh>, hmm <sigh>, well the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo, it felt like a really hard decision at the time, you know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it, um so that felt like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision, but at the time it was really difficult to do that, pretty easy i sleep pretty well <sigh>, <deep breath> for the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money <sigh> at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great, but i it's 'cause i am worried but you know i'm also confident that things are gonna work out, nope <sigh>, nope, hmm <sigh>, i don't know i can't remember, i mean i don't feel, super happy all the time but i don't feel unhappy either sort of like just uh, even, keel, well i got to go to the um, my friends work at the motion picture academy so i get to see all the oscar-nominated movies, , she was there one night so uh i really enjoyed catching up with her and, seeing her again so that was very pleasant <sigh>, <deep breath> i think, they would say um reliable, and, loyal <sigh>, and, considerate and thoughtful, <deep breath> no <sigh> i really have worked hard on that, i think, there are lots of things maybe i would do differently but there's nothing that really i regret, um, <deep breath> well i just think that there are things, that, um <sigh>, like it's not worth wasting the energy, to think about things that i regret, so i don't have a lot of regrets about things, <deep breath> oh that's a good question <sigh> um <sigh> don't worry about the small stuff, and save more money <laughter>, like, well there's uh you know the normal things like i'd lose more weight and i would um, uh <sigh>, think be a little more fearless maybe <sigh>, be a little more bold, i don't think i have any the of those, <deep breath> well i'm i am self-employed so i work all the time <laughter> so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients, um, that's something i enjoy, um, so that would that would be ideal at this point my weekends if i were really busy, <deep breath> that i've really been able to take care of myself and that, you know i've done pretty much everything that i've said that i've wanted to do, i've done that, and i don't and i don't have regrets about things there's nothing really that, eh, is un feels undone, in my life sure there's plenty of things i still wanna do, um but, i feel like i've done what i said i was gonna do, <deep breath> yeah <sigh> that's not so great well it's okay um both my parents are deceased and i have a sister and a brother, um, i feel closer to my brother than my sister but um, they both live on the east coast and i live in l_a, um and then i have <ha> my sister has two girls, so i feel very close to my nieces although we don't talk as much as we used to 'cause they're teenagers so, they have other things on their mind, <deep breath> um probably my teacher, a person i learned my holistic body work from, i really like to <sigh>, model my work and my way of being after him, like he's a a good role model, for me the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life, <deep breath> um we're pretty close we're not you know best of friends but i do i know that i can call him any time i need him, um <sigh> put me in a good mood <sigh>, usually being with my friends or going out to dinner, or um <sigh>, yeah just spending time with my friends, okay, thanks <sigh>, bye",1
402,"yes, okay, atlanta georgia, um in two thousand and six, never, uh i don't like it there <laughter>, oh it's completely boring and there's very little to do, l_a is preferable i think to most places, uh because uh i was engaged to my fiancee and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and, um he loves the water, but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i didn't love florida, and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we could both be happy, and also have um more opportunities in business and, all of the great things that it has to offer, very <laughter> very easy, there's not much i don't like about l_a, i love l_a um i think it feels magical, uh so many creative different people, of all ages, um shapes sizes colors races, um, the mountains the water, uh, the city all the things that there are to do all the people there are to meet i just, i love everything about l_a, no, uh, i'd rather not talk about it, um i didn't go to college, i'm still figuring that out, um, i don't know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really love and i never had a dog, um as an adult i had cats and uh, um i think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't, i really don't want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run, it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more shy although most people would consider me to be outgoing, mm, put on classical music <laughter>, music classical music if i'm especially <ex> especially stressed and, um play with my dog, go for a walk, i think i'm really good at controlling my temper, for the most part, um before i came here <laughter>, um it was just about um, financial stress, uh, um, there's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question, yeah i'd rather not talk about that either <laughter>, i'd rather not talk about that, not very easy at all, um a lot better recently but um, i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so, it's challenging, um not to feel rested most of the time, in the past week i've been feeling a lot better, um yes i um, the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having, um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um, having trouble with tolerating cold, and so i wasn't doing a lot of the things that i normally do, and i also was sick with the flu, um and in the past week i decided um, that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um, getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog every day and um, not isolating so much, and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing, i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and um that uh, in the past week things have taken a more positive turn, no, yes, uh, it's been quite some time officially, it's probably been, i don't know exactly but let's see, maybe more than fifteen years ago, um i was feeling suicidal, no, um because i found a better alternative, um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen, and i've tried a variety of um methods, and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer, and um that was really the first person that, um helped me, uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well, and even though i've struggled with some bouts of, depression it's never been anything, extremely severe and um it was, one of the best things that ever happened, well um i was physically ill, with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person, um because he had cured her of that disease and, um, that was um, he treats multiple issues and so, everything is interrelated so um, once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me, i was so happy, um i felt like i some um, i felt that, i found the answer that i'd been looking for that i hadn't given up hope and uh, that um, <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i, i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally, found, the answer to the, solution that i was looking for i was like, it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made, i felt, extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time, <laughter> um i went to um, i went to a music store, because uh i had been thinking about, um taking up an instrument i used to play, the violin as a child and uh, i've been wanting to do something, that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed, and um, and so i went to the music store to try out, um to see what it would feel like to, um, to handle an the instrument again, nan, and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue, it was awesome <laughter>, mm, yeah i'd rather not talk about that <laughter>, um, well, <laughter> there's probably a lot but um, i'm always working on being more optimistic um, it's been challenging it takes time but um, yeah i wish i could hear my own, internal voice better, <laughter> yeah i have regrets sure yeah, um, value myself more so that i would make better, relationship decisions, uh, my fiancee is the most positive, person in my life, my ultimate supporter, uh he's i think very unique not uh, not at all selfish and uh, probably a little too giving for his own good but um, always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know, would give somebody the shirt off of his back, um is a genius, in so many ways and uh, um, i'm pretty lucky i think, that, i'm not a quitter, that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i haven't, given up on, taking risks and, um",11

cincinnati, yeah, that's good., two months ago, two and a half months, i was just looking., just wanted to be in a new environment, oh, yeah, i'm ecstatic, very happy, uh it took a few weeks just to be adjusted, because i didn't know anyone., the weather is probably the best, yes and uh, i mean differently than that, it's pretty much the same as anywhere else i've been, there's nothing i don't really like about l a, it's just you know, only the weather is the best part of it, yeah, that's good., i like to travel, i didn't travel much in my life, but in the past., uh year and a half i've done, quite a trip made, only different places see different people new people new faces, new places, uh.., let's see, last summer i spent the uh summer in cleveland., < sniffle> in urban agriculture, in the city, yes and uh, i stayed in a hostel the first hostel in cleveland, , and, i did a program with the uh., , and it was basically, we will, go to various urban farms throughout the city and, voluntary, approx. 25 hours per week, so yes., really a spur of the moment kind of thing, um, i wanted to try something else i had never done before., and agriculture is one of those things you know most people, would never try, because you know, because of a certain stigmatization that's related to it., uh, and you know, i thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that., yeah, that's good., what in the uh, uh mm, urban agriculture or in general, in urban agriculture uh, i don't know, i guess uh, i don't know, only the general experience just go, you know, food uh go to the farmer's markets and eat all the fresh food and, only see the difference in, you know how fresh natural foods taste anyway you know, unlike the foods you buy in a grocery store, yeah, that's good., yes, it really is., i had two semesters., of uh college and i was undecided, so i only took general courses., my dream job, what are you doing?, i guess my dream job would be, <ss> everything that includes <invol> uh i don't have a certain dream job, but everything that concerns nature, i'm just outside., i'd like to.., i wouldn't mind being like a forest ranger or anything., as long as i know,, yeah, that's good., i think i'm more shy, i don't know why it's exactly like that., uh huh, i'm reading, um, listening to music, uh, i draw, watch movies like this, yeah, that's good., i think i'm pretty good at it., i think, <thi>, yeah, that's good., , yeah, i can't remember the last time i had a fight with someone., i don't know., <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth>, again i don't know, because, i don't know., about things that have happened in the past, yeah, that's good., < slaughter>, mm, maybe whether or not to come to california, i guess that was a tough decision., all right., i don't know that i've been thinking about it., you know you're moving to a new place for a long time, and <sigh> i guess, the hardest part of the decision was, think that , whether or not i was, safe or not, you know what i mean, um, just go to a new place where you don't know anyone, uh, it's kind of.., you really don't know what's going to happen., so, uh, there was a lot of uh, you know, anxiety in this, in this decision of the, should i go to a place where i don't know anyone i don't know?, you know, only, only perception has ever had <ha> that i have of this area, you know what i saw in the media and t v, so you know it, oh, yeah, i guess that was, difficultest decision i can imagine, yeah, that's good., oh, guess what., nothing absolutely nothing, yeah, that's good., uh, nothing, i don't feel guilty about anything., relationship with my family, i'm not very close to my family., i guess the person, i'm closest to my mother, but you know, i don't know that i never really talk to her much., uh, i don't know my father so well., you know, <makes click sounds with mouth>, < whistling soft>, < whistling soft>, uh, i guess my grandmother, yeah, her., yeah, she's.., she's very.., how should i say it uh, she's very, she's a thinker, i put it as if it were very instructive., so, um, yeah, i'm looking at her., for a lot of advice because, she's been through a lot in her life, and i feel like she knows she's been through a lot, so she understands a lot, so you know it, it is a very positive influence, very simple, uh, perhaps unsafe, i'd say, because, now i really don't know., in which direction i want to go with my life, and there was a lot of confusion with the, um, but, you know it's not, it's not something that overly affects me, but you know it's always a thought in my back of my mind, it feels like, somehow, maybe i'm running out of time, and i know it's not that it's not , that's not a realistic thought, because, i don't understand how you could run out of time., but, yeah, i guess so., only in general, don't know what i want, but i know how, how can i handle this?, how can i handle this?, i don't know that i'm thinking a lot about it., seeking a lot of soul, it's not hard, i mean, i mean, i'm, it's ., as i can't say, it's hard because it's one of those things that, i feel like it's necessary, and, you know certain things in life that you just, you're forced to turn yourself in., so, it's harder, i think it's harder to avoid, this kind of things, yeah, that's good., no, uh, today, when i was talking when i was talking to my friend., yeah, that's good., how would my best friend describe me, i guess he'd say i'm quiet., uh, uh, would he describe as a nice guy, uh, guesses instructive, mm, stupid., and, yeah, that's good., oh, i don't really think so, no, ten or twenty years ago, i guess i'd say,, stick with what i love, hmm, i did it., acting workshop, in order, , yeah, that's good., i don't know that it was always an

can't remember the last time i had a fight with someone., let's see when i.., a small child, i was in front of my grandparents' restaurant., and there was a robbery and i saw it well i saw it when the robbers went, um, yeah, maybe i'd want to erase this from my memory if i could, well, i didn't know what was happening at that moment, so i didn't feel, so bad at the time, but i felt bad afterwards, because then, um, they know my mother was upset that my mother was there, and she had to call the police and it was, it was disturbing to see her., you know, really disturbed, but, at the time when it actually happened, i wasn't really upset, it was more the aftereffects of him, mm it was <wa> it was, < sigh> situation that, i don't know., well, i can imagine that there's probably a million

okay, i've got a good one., um, i didn't marry the girl i should have married., so, that's a big one for me., yeah, good., we were together for about four years, and i think i took her for granted, and i just didn't commit myself., and, that was a long time ago and now it's been so many years that i know i don't know that if it's a realization, but i think now that, yeah, she should've been my

should have done, what the smart thing would have been., well, the last thing i can imagine i'd say i felt guilty about was, no i feel a lot of guilt about my friendships i don't feel like i'm so good of a friend, how i could be, but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh, how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help anyone who has a problem i can't, i never feel like i can help anyone., who i know, who has a problem like this, oh, that happens every day i think it happens to everyone i know and everyone, all my relatives and all

kept on a very surface level, i don't think they know that i don't think my family really knows me very well, and i don't know her very well, even in one not in a true sense, so, yes, it is., i think a lot of families are like that, but it's, it bothers me that mine is like this, oh, it's very simple, i sleep a lot, and i.., yes, i have no problem sleeping at all, no not really i would say, she's like me, now it's the way i think i've been like this all my life, even when i was a little child, i also slept a lot and, no, i don't think i've changed a lot., mm pretty low, but as i said, in a way i could say, yes i feel really depressed, but then again, i've always been like this, it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently like this, yes, a long, oh, a long time ago, i was.., about ten years old or, around there over, i just missed a lot of school., i didn't want to go to school, so they sent me to, to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh, it went from there, no, i didn't go to therapy., since i was a teenager, all right., i don't feel like it's even helping me., so, one day i just.., decided that i don't want to go anymore, eh, like i said, i don't feel like it helped me., so i guess i don't know it influenced me very much, no, i wouldn't say, disturbing, no, mm, good i feel pretty happy when i see my nephew, and uh i have a, the kids of my best friend are, i feel like they're my nephew and niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them., my ideal weekend would be.., i would travel <tr> i would probably travel i would i, really enjoy just from the city every weekend around, anywhere go really only everywhere from the city, uh just see how different people live and how people are different wherever you go, i really think people are different when you're in different places and, how they interact with you and how they see the world, different foods, um, and i also like historical places i'm in history and i and i enjoy just visiting somewhere that has some kind of, historical significance, oh, i haven't made a trip in a long time., the last trip i really did, i went to france for a wedding a few years ago, and i had a really good time there and i always wanted to go to paris and so i went to paris and then i went to a small town, um, that's a few hours from paris where the actual wedding was, and yes, it was really funny, i think the church where the wedding was uh like a thousand years old so, yes, it was a really cool trip, i don't know what would be considered unforgettable., uh, an unforgettable experience, probably the most memorable experience i guess would be easy, nothing special than living with the girl i just told you earlier that i think now, that we would have, married, um, this is something that remains in my memory, so i say it's unforgettable because, it's still with me and.., it's something i don't think you know well, i know i'll never forget, but it's not just, mm specific day or moment you know, oh, a lot.., i wish i could be healthier., for one thing, uh more energy, and, more friendly good no i think i'm pretty friendly, but more uh more based on more social <s> more uh more social, around these two things mainly i think i would like to get more socially excited and more, and healthier, oh, that's a good question, my best friend, how would my best friend describe me, i think, i think he'd say that i, a very <sigh> good it sounds cheesy, but it <laughter> he would probably say that i am a very spiritual person, and that i give very much i think i'm much more selfish than people think i'm but people think i'm not selfish, um, and probably he would say that i'm creative too, , good my advice to myself, i don't understand the question <laughter>, yeah, but we've already talked about it., i don't think i really believe in being proud or proud., i don't think it's really something you can be proud of, but i can't really think about it., results achieved, anyway, even if i had something <laughter> to be proud of no, i can't think of anything <anythi> some kind of performance i had, uh something i recently did that i really enjoyed, well, i sang karaoke

me i didn't wanna be intimidated by it, oh yeah, oh yeah, <laughter>, um to be employed writer, extremely difficult, extremely difficult writing, any type of fictional fiction writing's extremely difficult, if i worked then <th> as hard as i do now when i was in school i'd have a p_h_d in math and physics, <sigh> it's so hard, outgoing, it depends on the circumstance, it's it's not a catch-all, depends on the the moment, what do i do to relax, i swim, mhm, swam when last time i swam, um, last friday, yeah mm last friday, what do i do when i am annoyed, mm, swear to myself, pretty good mm, pretty good, takes, takes a lot to get me to express anger, but i do, it was in traffic actually <laughter> so probably two weeks ago, so in traffic, sure um, , um just waiting for the light <l> light, and some guy in a pickup is honking at me i'm like, so i honk back, and so he didn't like that, and he pulled up along side me i had have no idea what his problem was, and um we had a little <li> few words, yeah, i mean i i have no idea what i was doing wrong, just waiting for the light, guilty that's a strong word, <sigh>, don't know if i feel guilty as i feel remorseful about actions or words, said and done in the past they come up, oh just past interpersonal <inter> you know interpersonal reactions with friends or family, you know it'll just hit you one day you're not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason and just out of the blue it hits you and i'm like oh, why'd i say that why'd i do that, <deep breath>, mm <sigh> a situation, <sigh>, uh woo drawing a blank, um, for me that question has a negative connotation, so something that's possibly negative in my recent past, um <sigh>, what would i have done differently, i've i don't, i'm pretty in control, of my emotions, and taking the temperature of the moment and responding knowing when to respond and when and knowing not to respond, um, so nothing really springs to mind that i wish i had done differently recently in my past past yes but not recently, oh, swallowing my pride, putting my tail between my legs, and saying i was wrong to friends, sure, , um, , i contacted him again and then we're fast friends again, mhm, <sigh>, <sigh>, you know this is again this is past past, so, not recent past, so um, probably, altercations that i've had with my uh mom, you know, things i've said to hurt her, you know, you know when you, hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks, so any time any one of those situations you know, so when i'm i think my emotional i_q has, grown, so i think, in the past past my emotional i_q was very was stuck on infant <laughter>, so, so, i have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families, um my father never had a good relationship, don't know if that will be possible he's still alive but he's in advanced alzheimer's so he's mad at everybody, right now, oh it's fine, you know, it was slow, so, someone oh um, , has been positive influence in my life um, my sisters i talk with my sisters, so, extremely easy i sleep well each night about <abo> anywhere from at least eight to ten hours a night, <laughter> yeah, oh lethargic um <sigh>, just going through the motions <laughter> you know, um, it's like this i'll frame it like this david lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he's done some, crazy stuff, as far as movies and t_v's concerned, he said the idea of the angst-driven artist is b_s he says you wanna be creative get a good night's sleep i like that, mhm, good um i can't wait to get up and start the day, oh um, if if that happens it's gradual i'm always thinking about, my behavior and my thought processes and how to, be more productive, in my life, with what, p eh you mean no i don't think so no i haven't be diagnosed <diag> no i haven't been diagnosed with any psychological, acronym <laughter>, no, <deep breath>, uh <sigh> this weekend, had a good good time with friends we had a great mm, was with friends and we just were able to talk about, you know some things and, uh for <fo> conversation lasted for two and a half hour three hours didn't expect it to happen it was good i like talking with smart people, informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare, it's almost like running <ru> uh the high you get after running, or exercising you know the endorphins, it was the same thing, i um, <sigh> either with friends or working on my stuff my writing, or exercising, my heighth, <laughter> i wish i were taller, um, i wish, mm, taller uh physical <phys> just physicality um i wish i didn't wear glasses, mhm, nothing internal, mm, i'm patient i've been commended for my patience, by strangers, um, mm, my relationships with my friends and my family, i understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them, and i take that time and energy, well that's a really open general question of course you know it goes back um are you talking recently are you talking, in the past <pa>, um, i always regret <sigh> things <th>, i regret, this is a little thing it's not a big thing, not being more, productive or efficient in the use of my time each day it's a little thing <laughter>, you know so, i hate wasting time i hate wasting money i hate wasting energy, <deep breath> <sigh>, hm, that's a deep question, <sigh>, i'd say, i was

351,"yes, empty the throat , all right., to new york, to look for a job in the music industry, uh yes, i'm self employed., to become a music producer, it's pretty hard that there's a lot of competition <laughter>, um, to look for a job, um, if.., about a year ago last february, it was quite difficult east coast is much different than the west coast, i think i've been there twice last year., no, i'm more of a creature of habit, um, yeah., sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd, so it's better to be quieter sometimes and see everything instead of knowing that you're going in and pursuing things actively., um, <laughter> probably uh listen to music and spend time with my dogs, <freezes the neck>, likely to be insensitive to humans around, not very nice to me or.., to see or to see injustices, i think that's it, <laughter>, um, pretty good., you know sometimes <so>, um, probably a few days ago around one of my friends said that she said a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about it, yes, it does <laughter>, pretty close, my best friend, so.., oh, just one of my friends, um, i'm kind of quiet about it, and when a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when i usually overreact, it's pretty hard to find out more about the person that i somehow withdraw and actively engage in myself instead of getting it to the point where it's like around it comes to a point where it blows out of the relationship, um, to probably spend time with my family, in new york, very close, um, my sister and my brother, i don't know they're just great people., and i love her very much and, they're very similar to me, so i feel like i have people who understand me., um, likely, um, i guess loyally.., sensitive to <laughter>, i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a difficult question <laughter>, no, none <free throat>, yes, god, i think probably nineteen ninety seven so long ago, um, i just went through this time i just went through a lot of problems and i felt insecure to myself so that i end up going to the doctor to get some medication and therapy and so, um not at the moment i have been about six months ago, i just thought the therapist wasn't really helping me. i thought we were talking about the same things over and over again., she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time, so i just knew it was a change, it's okay <laughter>, yes, i do., when i feel connected to a therapist and when i feel like it's a great way for me to talk about what i'm going through., um, i'm better at describing my feelings and feelings, i think the biggest thing is to, when i'm in situations, i can see how i react in a way, and i take a step back and see how i can usually almost react in a way., i also tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and somehow bury them and make them feel really bad about myself., so it's nice to talk to someone who doesn't judge, who doesn't really tell me, as you know, that they tell me it's o okay, basically <free throat>, um, to be hopeless all the time, don't you know enough energy to do things i like i had a little concentration problems, um, with strange disturbing thoughts sometimes just in my mind and only overall just feeling a little lousy about life, um, sometimes they're like random moments when there's something like a problem with my interpersonal life or something like that, or when i even see something on tv sometimes that affects me, to listen to music or distract me to try, as my therapist told me the longest, to log., to record things, empty the throat , it was a hard transition to come here, so uh good to be here, so to be half and half in order and not to be all right., i have the feeling that i've been a little

thoughts about my mind at night <empty throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite often during the night <empty throat>, smokes the throat very groggy in the morning , it's like i'm yawning a lot during the day and my friends are always so oh why yawn you are so uninterested in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not like that at all <laughter>, probably christmas time when i was with my family, just really happy and.., feeling that everything in my life was all right, with a good feeling of how i was present at this moment with myself, um, maybe you know., let's see, that's a difficult question., i think probably, i can read people well sometimes, and.., uh i like to say uh i'm good at being a good friend to people being a good family member uh, i'm a hard worker when i have a job, so <laughter>, um, to be sure that i mean, it's life, so there's, of course, regret about, one that comes to mind is the desire that i don't eat so much so that i can be much more healthy <laughter>, um, do not take things so seriously <laughter> to enjoy being teeny and to, i think that's it <laughter>, um, i don't know., that's a good question., probably to my

374,"yes, pretty good, alexandria virginia, mhm, i moved to i a., end of two thousand one, yes, it's crazy <laughter>, um, a few times a year usually like for holidays, it's very different., i think it's much softer, um, it's much more like suburban., it's nice., there's something comforting about it, but it's always like i'm getting a little restless when i'm there and looking forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>, i went to college in u s c., it wasn't bad, i mean my program that i was in., was so intense that, as for the first year, it was all consumed so that i really didn't have much free time to think about the adjustment, it was just like i was <laughter> my life wasn't my own so, that did it somehow, to easier i appreciate and also i was like in a community of people i knew with so automatically i knew people and you know friends and so, it wasn't bad., film, one day i had a revelation, i was no longer undergraded., i was kind of a little flundering i didn't really know what i wanted to do, and, just one day i was kind of like you know what i'm really excited about what i'm really passionate about, and, i realized that movies are the thing i love the most and i'm most passionate about it, so i decided to go to film school., a little yes and no it's not me i'm so <s> i'm like in a little transition at the moment, but yeah as in recent years i've produced uh like freelance producer <sniffle>, so this is the question of the moment <laughter> around, i think that uh, i don't necessarily have a job title that's my dream job, but i know it's kind of, what's that?, i want and because basically as i live a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know this is how exhausting and i don't want to do that anymore, so i'm looking for something that's stable, you know, full time, nice benefits and i definitely want to stay in the entertainment industry, um, and i like to know what i love about producing is that it's just like there are constant challenges and you don't know anything about it., what will be thrown at you that i, that you know that it is always interesting and exciting, so i'm trying to figure out what a good one would be right now., to be a place for me where i can reasonably be challenged and you know have a kind of, as space to grow and advance and all this, yeah, that's good., i can't see your shoes., i like to travel around, i don't know that i haven't done much lately, but i've known you in the past,, a fair amount paid, um, i love the adventure of only you know new experiences new places new people, i think it's just good to get out of your little island world and see what's out there, and you just know it., see, beautifully remarkable, places and things and simply experience different ways of life and different languages and cultures <sniffle>, um, let's see, i went to costarica a few years ago., um, my best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days and it was likely that, this could be like my, favorite trip of all time <laughter> as if it was really awesome, but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful, um, and we just spent like, we went to three different places and to explore just a lot and how sightseeing we walked a ton, which was amazing, and then like the last place we landed was this little beach town, so it was at this point as if we felt like you know that we had done all this like amazing physical effort, like ziplines and all these walks, so that when we came to the beach, it was like, we deserve the right to step back and relax., it hit everyone from the, you know it as fed this kind of desire for adventure and activity around but it also, i'm also a great fan of vacation where you just like veg out and relax and how to lie on a beach with a book so it somehow hit everything, what do i do to relax?, i mean, depending on where i am, like when it is, you know if i'm like at work or something, and i'm stressed out, i'm just gonna.., you know, take a minute and breathe just like really deep and try to calm me down, um, when i'm home, i might like it., you know, throw on a movie or like a t v show that i really like and only that gives a feeling of how, type of escape relief, pretty good, i don't mean, it takes a lot to make me very angry, it doesn't happen very often., um, the last time i had a fight with someone, my mother was <laughter> and it was about money <laughter> <depth breath>, um, i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was, how to judge me unjustly, and that was disturbing, yes <laughter>, um, it's good, uh you know they live all over the country from me so i don't see them often, but as i usually talk to, my mom on the phone probably like once in the week and, my parents are really supportive <sigh> around, they are, you know how when i go home to see how i enjoy i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time, so i'd say we have a pretty, pretty good relationship, i guess because i'm like that., type of work hunting, phase i feel guilty sometimes that i don't like, do enough you know how there are times when there are like days where maybe like i should have, sent a few more summaries or more things as i feel guilty sometimes for not how productive enough <sniffle>, usually it's pretty easy the last few weeks as was atypical as not as good, i'm not sure i haven't figured it out yet., but i just had more, uh, like nights, in which, either, takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason, um, i also have a lot like really strange intense dreams that wake up like me sometimes i wake up myself sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking, which is weird <laughter> the so yes, it's just i don't know, not that i was able to identify, i mean, i think maybe i'm more stressed than usual just because i'm doing my job situation like, in the river, but, i don't know that there was no similar event., i appreciate good sleep, and i'm used to it, so it's just not good., feeling, um, not really no, yes, to <sigh>, as < sigh>, i think in how, october or november, although this is actually the second time that it happened in my life, but the first time was like, many years ago <sniffle>, um, i felt like i was, a really low and how too low for me to free me from, to <sigh>, just a hard time, work on the most fundamental, level as only, get up and, in a shower, and go to the grocery store, and you know, answering e mails was just like, it took so much energy, um, so yeah, i just wasn't really, normal working, yeah, that's good., yes, yeah., <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say, so, < deep breath> i think that the therapy, is good for me because it, helps me to open up, my kind of patterns.., and also like, ah, just how to observe how i am like reaction to certain situations and just think it's < deep breath> it gives me a more elevated like kind of self consciousness around, so that unlike just like, um, kind of just react to situations i'm like, mm, just as if i noticed more what's going on around, and it just helps,, um, i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really know <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>, , i don't know., i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale>, oh, maybe about uh, about christmas at home with my family, yeah, that's good., um, well, it was just, it was like i just started getting out of my depression., and, as you know, i live alone here i have a dog, but so i only had a long time of, feeling, not, <laughter> great and easy to do everything alone and somehow wish my family was around me, um, so, when i was with them, it was just.., it just felt very much like, safe and comfortable and just as you know it, warm family hug, to <sigh>, <laughter> i think she'd call me, funny, and smart, and, um, a good listener, not legally binding, um, i don't know that <laughter> enough <laughter>, all right., so, this happened, the last like, job i had i mean i was it wasn't technical i was a freelancer, but i worked for this company for how, one and a half years almost two years and uh, i had a very small company, the boss had a really good relationship with my boss, and he's kind of pissed off., he's kind of out of nowhere, uh, mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and around, essentially as, the agreement we had is that he would pay me like a monthly holder for my services and then i would get paid fees per project, so he liked to put me on this conversation and was like you know our big customer who's like you know the bread and butter of the company that they really cut back, as you probably notice that things are getting really slow and i was like yeah, and he's like i'm gonna stop paying you for your hold., and that was a total surprise, but i was fine and he went on to talk like, he, i would still have the right to the first rejection of all the projects that came through the door and you know because that he seemed like you know, even if i didn't get the retainer anymore, he would still throw me enough work, as if i didn't know it wasn't like a drama., decline in the amount of money i made <cough> excuse me, but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work that i love to work with you, you're fantastic, yada yada so, to make a long story short, what happened then, that he fired me., um, and he was his way of pushing me out of the company and letting me go because from then on,, he stopped calling me, he stopped e mailing me., and later like a few months down the street, i had to go back to the office because there were some projects that still, running like the customer took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was there, i saw that around, this guy who, had worked with us a number of similar, if we needed another producer, like if we were beaten, we would get him to do something else., he did my job like that., yeah, so it's just like, it was a real <rea> <laughter> it was a really crappy way of getting fired without being told that i was fired around and it was just like, that uh the reason i want if i could erase that is out of my mind because i don't really think of another situation that makes me feel as angry and frustrated and just like, in a way that, that, although this was as you know a few months ago, feels very unresolved and makes me somehow like, angry when i think about it, so yeah that was a very long explanation, but that's what i want <laughter>, , i um, a very loyal person <deep breath> around, i'm, smart i am organized i < deep breath> around, very like caring kind, um, i'm conscientious., and i work hard <sniffle>, <laughter> uh, man, i think, to uh, be more confident, and, less passive, um, to really, focus on, what i want and the things i know will make me happy and just go out and get them instead of sitting back and waiting for opportunities to imagine, hmm <sigh> um, probably just a few of the, relationships i formed with people, um, just like really, you know deep friendships, you're welcome., see you.",2

it's very different um, i think it's a lot more mellow, um it's way more like suburbia, it's nice, um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>, i went to um grad school at u_s_c, um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in, was so intense that, like for the first year, it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so, that made it kind of, um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so, it wasn't bad, film, hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad, i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do, and um, just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about, and um, i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school, um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle>, <sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um, i think that uh, i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of, what um, i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable, um you know full time, nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry, um, and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know, what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting, um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good, place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a, like room to to grow and advance and all that, yeah, <laughter> i can't see your shoes um i, i like to travel um, i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past, done a fair amount, um, i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people, um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know, see, beautiful remarkable, places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle>, um, let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago, um, my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days and it was that's probably, that might be like my, favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful, um, and we just spent like, we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing, and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like, we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of, it hit all of the, you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also, i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything, what do i do to relax um, i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will, you know, kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way, um, if i'm home i might just like, you know, throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like, sort of escape relief, um pretty good i don't i mean, eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often, um, the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath>, um, i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was, like judging me unfairly, and that was upsetting, yeah <laughter>, um, it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to, my mom on the phone probably like once a week and, my parents are really supportive <sigh> um, they are, you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time, um so i'd say we have a pretty, pretty good relationship, i guess because i'm like in this, sort of job hunting, phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like, doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've, sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle>, usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good, i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out, but um i've just had more, uh, like nights where, it either, takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason, um, i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know, not that i have been able to identify, i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like, in flux but, i i don't know there was no like event, cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good, feeling, um, not really no, yes, um <sigh>, like <sigh>, i think in like, october or november, although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like, many many years ago <sniffle>, um, i felt like i was, a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it, um <sigh>, just having a hard time, functioning on the most basic, level like just, getting up and, taking a shower, and like going to the grocery store, and you know, answering emails was just like, it took so much energy, um, so yeah i just i wasn't really, functioning normally, yeah, yes, yes um, <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so, <deep breath> i think that therapy, is good for me because it, helps me focus on, my sort of patterns um, and also like, ah, just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like, um, kind of just reacting to situations i'm like, mm, just like noticing more what is going on um, and it just helps to, um, i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>, <deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um, i don't know um, i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um, eh maybe over uh, over christmas being at home with my family, yeah, um, well it just was, that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then, and um, like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of, feeling, not, <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me, um, so when i was there with them it just um, it just felt very like, safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know, warm familial embrace, um <sigh>, <laughter> i think she would describe me as, funny, and smart, and, um, a good listener, nonjudgmental, um, i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter>, okay um, so, this happened, the the last like, job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like, a year and a half close to two years and uh, i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat>, he sort of out of nowhere, uh, mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um, essentially like, the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project, so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah, and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer, and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how, he, i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know, even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore, he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic, decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me, but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic, yada yada so, to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me, um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point, he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me, and later on like a couple of months down the road, i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still, ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um, this guy who, had worked with us a bunch kind of like, if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff, he was doing my job so, yeah so it just like, it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like, that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like, in a way that's like, that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like, angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>, <deep breath> um <sigh> let's see, i um, a very loyal person <deep breath> um, i am, smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um, very like caring kind, um, i'm conscientious, and i work hard <sniffle>, <laughter> uh, man, i think, to uh, be more confident, and, less passive, um, to really, like focus on, what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle>, hmm <sigh> um, probably just some of the, relationships that i formed with people, um, just like really, you know deep friendships, you're welcome, bye",2
414,"yeah, i'm okay, burbank california, yeah, the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather, um, it's not too, city like chicago or new york, it's um it's big enough we have beaches we're not land locked woo, sometimes the smog, the traffic, the fact that i've just been here like my entire life almost, not enough as i'd like to i go to school in chicago, and i've been to new york a couple times, san francisco and i took a road trip across the country, that was cool i saw a couple states, seeing new places, um, going to landmarks that i've only, read about or seen pictures of, um, i traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route sixty six, and the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time, it was, the coolest thing i've ever seen probably <laughter>, happy, and then just happy it was it was beautiful it was nice, i haven't felt like that in a long time, i was studying film, it's just, something i've always loved for as long as i can remember and when it came time to start, applying to schools i wasn't sure what i wanted to do, and um, i applied to northwestern as a film student, and it just ended up being the right decision, ooh <laughter>, um, i love making movies, but part of me really loves, making people laugh and being in front of the camera, so, uh, comedian a comedic <comie> <laughter> comedic actor would be totally great but, that's hard <laughter>, i am super outgoing, and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually <laughter>, i um, i like to watch mindless television, like um, toddlers in tiaras and um, duck dynasty just t_v programs where i really don't have to pay attention at all, i'm okay at it, i, get really, emotional really fast but i am usually, able to, to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff, for the most part, sometimes, i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily, and i hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long, um, my best friend <laughter> ryan i think, and it was about, our relationship and just, how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and, uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before, really hard, it's um, he's my best friend and i miss him, but, we messed up and it's just it's not the same, it's like not the same friendship <laughter>, me too <laughter>, <laughter> too many um, i guess, , when i had a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend, which was not okay, i wish i would've just, realized that this was bad, and just would've stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my break up, and then our friendship being really messed up, i guess not spend as much time with him as i did, be more assertive, um, i guess, it was, in november, i was very depressed and suicidal, so i told my friend, what i was feeling, and that she needed to take me to the e_r, and from the e_r i had the choice to, i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital, and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i, decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever, um, <exhale> it was awful, it was in chicago and um, it was scary, i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just, start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was, mostly men and um they were all really old, and, it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter>, so that was pretty scary and i just um, it was really hard for me <laughter>, i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies, about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work, i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and, i wasn't talking to any of my friends and, i was, drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and, i was just in a really bad place, and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help, it was, um, i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager, and i tried to kill myself then, and i um got put in therapy for quite some time, so, i figured i don't want to go down, that bad path again, i just wanna get better, so i had to do it i had to get help, i do i go once a week, i feel like if you have the right therapist, it's really useful, i had one therapist that i really liked, and i thought we could've gone really far but, sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to, i have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay, she's not, we're not, that great together but she's who i had right now, it's better than nothing <laughter>, not that easy at all, um, ever since <yawn>, i got out of the hospital and start, and i began medication for my depression, i um, just haven't been able to sleep well, falling asleep is hard staying <laughter> asleep is hard, have really, crazy vivid dreams, that wake me up and are disturbing, um, i guess just, sometimes they reflect, things that i'm worried about, or happening in my life but they're just, they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen, and it's usually no you dreamed that, sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up, probably <laughter> like two nights ago, that is a, hard question, i think, in november <yawn>, after i got out of the hospital, i finally had one good day, and my friend took me into, downtown chicago, and we went to the sears tower, and got to look, over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool, <laughter> um probably, super outgoing, likes to be the center of attention, funny and a little bit crazy, i try not to regret things in my life, oh, um, i would say that, living is worth it, and just don't be afraid to ask for help, when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad, um i guess my ideal weekend would be <laughter>, sleeping in and then, catching a movie with my friends, maybe going home with them and, bake some cookies <laughter> eat all the cookies, watch some t_v have a sleep over, and then like make pancakes in the morning, and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do that <laughter> in my free time, go for a walk i don't know go to the beach <laughter>, um that is a hard question, i mean i think i've, done a lot of great things in my life, and um, i have achieved a lot, but, i think one of the proudest things, proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant, i was doing this exercise boot camp and, the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like, thirty push ups and, it was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone wanna help him if someone helps him you have to do half

331,"yes, all right., connecticut, um , acting <laughter>, well, i moved to san francisco in ninety four and then i moved to atlanta in ninety six and then i moved out here to be an actor and i became a realtor instead, to be on a t v show, it's pretty hard to be discovered and uh, you must be lucky and know the right people and be talented, <laughter> yeah, not really no, i don't travel so much that i moved to another city every few years and then i've been here for a while, so i don't travel much, the weather, there's always something to do, and, that's pretty much it <laughter>, um, people here tend to be a little ruder, and around it is only always a fast pace, well, when i moved here, i was twenty five, so it was much more fun, because when you're young in town, you can have a lot of fun, and then i came into the real estate and did really good for a while and then the market crashed and so now i'm old and i'm not making money, so times are hard, no no i am much more <m> more an extroverter, um, if i don't get what i want <laughter> and around, rude people, and, only ruthless people, i'm pretty good at controlling my temper if i'm not like drinking alcohol, it would make my temper worse, but if i don't drink, i'm pretty good at controlling my temper., the last time i had a fight with someone was, someone who owed me money, uh i live uh in westhollywood, no i live alone i have a dog, it's good, i mean, i don't like my neighbors, i hate my neighbors, but the ones upstairs just moved out, so that's good news hopefully the ones who move in aren't so loud and the lower ones i just can't stand because they're arguing with me, what are you doing?, why, because they say because of my hardwood floors that, i've been there for ten years and they're still arguing about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors, yeah, that's good., what was the question?, my mother was a very positive influence that she always tracked me down., she lived with me for the last ten years until she moved to rhode island recently to live with my brother., very close to my mother, not so close to my brother, but we're not so close to me., um, so i mean, we love each other, we just don't get along all the time., from the, life of the party, ambitious for, and sometimes cut throat, on what i am most proud of, always able to be through the things i need to get through where i want to be, i'm generous, i'm loyal., i'm kind., i'm accommodating, and, that's it., no, yes, about four years ago, to be good i had <ha> i was beaten and i had uh identity theft, and, uh, you know, i was just scared to leave, so i had to get over spending a year like this in my house without leaving, um and just depressed all the time i said i had to get out and start talking to people and so i got, thank you., okay, i'm panicking about the job situation, you know, because my bills are pretty high and i don't have a stable income right now., so that's what worries me the most is my uh financial situation, yeah, that's good., um , yes, i mean, well basically it's like i just stopped drinking together recently, so i don't drink anymore, so i realize, yeah, i mean, it's good because number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like how i handle when i drink, so that's a positive thing, but now that i drank, it helped me just forget and numb me., now i have to feel through the feelings that are pretty good because i can talk my way through them, so i guess i'm developing, yeah, a long time ago, you know, i took a lot of medication here and there, and.., they really would numb some of them me some of them would, i feel hyper that's how i recently decided to take < t> three to six months in the last six months just to take nothing, so i don't take anything i barely take an aspirin, just to get my body into a normal state, uh, not really., always worry about just a lot of worries getting worried about everything, oh what happens when i'm in a car accident, what happens when i can't pay my mortgage, what happens when i, eh eh anyway just so many things i worry about and that was what depresses me, i know., at a certain point i had, a few good therapists and i had some bad therapists, i like the ones who talk to me., and give me some guidance in contrast to those who just listen, and then they just say, okay, your time is so high and just prescribe me medications, so i think i'd be better off with a psychiatrist < psychiatrist> psychologist than a psychiatrist, um, well, i'm not going to therapy right now, but.., the therapy i had before, it was more like people trying to just come in, check me in and give me medication., i had another therapy where i was back and forth, like okay. well, that's what i'm thinking about, and you're thinking about it, and this kind of therapy is better., um, i'm just.., i didn't get the right therapists recently., so i knew the root of my problem was drinking because it's a depression., you know that stopping drinking definitely has me a much clearer mind and just working through things you know yourself, um , i can't think of anything right now., um , it's been a long time since i can't really think of a time when i felt really happy., thank you very much <sniffle>, um , okay, when i was a kid, um , i had a little dog and that big dog came and attacked him and killed him., so then a little later my father, came and he said to my brother and me, we were kids going to the car, there are two packages in the car, so get them., so i was like yeah because i never listened to my parents, so i was like a spoiled brat, but finally he said go to the car, what is that?, oh okay, he said go to the car and get that out of the car so i finally left and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food, so that's one of my memorable experiences, yeah, because i'm an animal lover., um, the way i treated the people before, when, i was hurt i was really mean or rude to the people, when i felt like you knew i was hurting i had to hurt everyone around me so, um, but when i've been drinking since i heard that i didn't do it so, so i think the problem is drinking and now that i let that go because i did it for the wrong reasons, you know that i did it to not believe i didn't do it to be sociable, get in a career that is really stable, like uh eh you know like a doctor or a nurse or a lawyer, something you know, or in advertising i would have in that a selling position it could be very good and very good or very bad so, you must always be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales, but if you make your money, save your money don't go spending it on extravagant things, when i have a job when i'm able to work, when i help other people, when other people around me are happy and laugh, when i can make people laugh, that makes me in a good mood, okay, thanks., you're welcome, thank you., see you.",8
335,"yes, i'm okay , uh i'm from here originally los angeles , mhm, um i like the weather , and my family's here which is why i'm here i moved away for a while, uh i like that there's a lot of, culture <cult> even though everyone says there's not culture in l_a there is a lot of culture there's theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people i like the diversity , mhm, um , well i don't like that i had to move back kind of against my will <laughter> so starting a new career, uh starting over in my career it so that's not really something, uh well i moved back 'cause my dad was sick , so, thank you , thank you, so that's why i'm here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous so , uh, acting, theater, it was, mhm, yeah , yeah i am , i'm an actor i uh right now i'm doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and , that sort of thing , um well my parents are both, artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then uh i was went to study musical theater, and somewhere along the lines i realized that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose but i still do both , mhm, no i don't , uh i don't usually have trouble talking to people uh i'm pretty friendly, i can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within five minutes of meeting me which i feel is a mark of an extrovert <laughter> , <laughter> um , i take a bath or read a book, uh go out with my friends, go to the theater, uh, eh sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or any of that going for a walk , mhm yoga, things that make me mad um , injustice <laughter> i can be very righteously indignant i suppose um , people who don't see those things and people who've who have a like entitlement i think entitlement and sense of privilege that can make me mad , yeah , uh , it depends i usually <usual> a lot of times it's i argue my case <laughter> i guess <laughter> um or i i call my best friend usually and complain, talk to her about it , pretty good pretty good i don't have too much of a temper , um, like a real argument or like a debate , <laughter> um, if was a real argument it probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argued about why we broke up stupid things like that , eh i think i was kind of, over it by then but , it was at times , <laughter> , um , the last time i felt really happy , was, like really happy, probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night i had a good time, uh, , it is it's nice, it's nice, my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything um she would describe me as , uh compassionate, and, uh having a a strong sense of who i am , i think, yeah she also she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that's something that she , makes fun of me for um because i do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing, nothing bad we have a very good relationship, hmm, yeah yeah it has <laughter> not terrible trouble but but yeah it's gotten me in trouble before sure , no, i haven't , no but i think i had it , but i never went to a doctor , um 'cause i had a i had a traumatic situation uh where somebody injured me, and i, i feel <fe> when i looked up p_t_s_d later i realized <reali> i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like going back into situations like that i would get panicky and um it was very , uh i held on to it for a really really long time, i think um, i think that i did have it but i just i don't know 'cause i never i never saw anyone about it , um , sometimes yeah uh, certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or um, it happened in a in an acting class, so sometimes certain teachers if they, criticize in a certain way, i start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like it's something that, someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it eh sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky yeah , no, well i mean my dad is sick so not great , but um but considering not terrible , um i've been having bad dreams , uh , uh just like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad , um , like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you looked them up always say like there's something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so , it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so , which way , okay , easy very easy , i am tired and maybe somewhat irritable goofy i get really goofy, yeah , um, i, am fairly non-judgmental , of other people i i i stay open-minded, uh i can make most people laugh i'm funny, uh creative , um, i, yeah those are some of the best ones i'd say , yeah , i love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning uh and just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels uh i like most things about traveling i even i even like flying i like all of it, well i just finished a tour a couple months ago um going up and down the east coast and then across the u_s and uh performing for kids all over , yeah and then we ended here in l_a , yeah yeah it was great it was a good time , yeah, um , lemmi think we , we went to , the hot springs the naturally occuring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to unwind, yeah , a lot of people i i would say, um i mean my dad comes to mind certainly, uh my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well , uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some <so> a few of my best friends from high school um and college that i've kinda grown up with and, become who i am with them, yeah , mhm, uh small things sure , yeah, uh, i regret , the way that i dealt with, a friendship that was ending once uh i regret , committing to certain people that i've dated , uh , but nothing huge i i tend to go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time, like being upset about things i've done in the past , hmm, stand up for yourself , um , <laughter> don't date felons <laughter> uh, i think that i, i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself, i think i i really internalize the idea of like, you know women being too needy or uh or um, i don't know those kinds of things and then and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that, and it's still something i work on , <laughter> i'm glad you think so , um , <sigh>, that's a good question uh , my friends and family , and uh , i my talents, i would say , yeah , yeah my ability to take situations and , take bad situations and continue and, uh make the best of everything , alright , <laughter> thank you , goodbye goodbye <laughter>",12

have <re>, i really think i'm doing it, not very difficult you don't know uh uh at least not for me because i think i have a natural inclination for it, uh and around i connect well with people, i'm more shy, but i'm forced to leave because i know you can't really do anything, to be shy, but if i had a choice, i'd rather, you know., a little more withdrawn <laughter>, until i know i feel like i'm just going the next safe way., so that somehow circumcised with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think, an example, well an example of what exactly you mean, which aspect, all right., good example like uh travel, sometimes you want to go to a certain place, and it's uh, something big is happening there, even though it's a great place, but it's not such a cool place to take as for example as boston i went there a lot, um, now you know that everyone i'm talking to is a little nervous if they should go there <laughter> you know you know it., know you have a great time you know i think it's because of all the interference that just happened somehow you know throws you out of the track a little make you rethink, um, is this a good place to escape at the moment, something like that you know, mhm, mm, uh, i got it., i'm going for a walk, i'm calling a friend we're drinking tea or something., i think i got this under control., mm eh, uh, it was probably something stupid in a work situation that took about five minutes and oh pretty much didn't fight again, i'm not really staying., negative things too much, uh, i don't regret it now., i can't think of anything., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, was uh, do not hire a good friend, for a job that, you know they weren't qualified., that's hard., because you have to tell them it's not the friendship you hire, it's their competence., my father, uh, he's just.., taught me how to, you know, uh overwhelmed, uh trouble when i grew up and how important it was not to give up, uh, and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it disappears you know if you keep there long enough, and i found that to be true, so, mhm, um, it's okay except for <exce> except for some of my uh, my, distant siblings, you know, i don't see as often as i can, yeah., you only know that if you travel a bit, you don't see people because they're not always there you know., it's nothing like mhm yeah, mhm, uh, well, you know, i'm i'm pretty excited when i'm working on something or developing something like that, i tend to overlook the time at some point, but unlike the, you know, when i get out, that's all., all right., i think i'm going to be a little uh, uh try and figure out how i'm going to sleep, you know as soon as i can to make , but to, uh i'm trying not to be uh grumpy or anything i'm just probably a little tired mm, i feel okay now., uh, changes like what, mm, well, i see a hopeful future you know and i see uh, i see a lot of new things unfolding, i mean from this perspective, yes, no, never, i feel okay now., i went to a great party last week., that was really cool, yeah, that's good., well, it was like on a roof uh, and a lot to really uh, nice people, which are basically in the same kind of uh, mindset, uh pursuing the same kind of uh uh objectives, and it was actually very inspiring and i got a lot of information, and many good connections have been made, mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome, my ideal weekend, is uh, cooking my own food relaxing, you know and, when i'm in the mood for company you know, i have friends and uh, you know, uh family members come to me, all right., i'd like to put more weight on it, but it doesn't seem to work., i eat like crazy and nothing happens, mm, well, you know, i think people in general sometime uh, uh misread <mis> misread you know if you like anyhow uh, if you look different or in <i> in a different kind of, when another set of things, make you uh excited or you're in a different way to think, people tend to misjudge you, you know, and that really pissed me off someday., but, um, i'm i somehow figured it out and i'm pretty over you know, so i see it as their loss and don't mean you know if they didn't meet me, you know that's hey, maybe they don't need it, and i don't really care that i've worked these things out somehow in the time you know., yeah, that's good., um my best qualities probably around, look, i think.., < mumble>, and uh, maybe just talk uh, uh you know, on a talkative level, uh, yeah, that's good., sometimes people tend to burden me with everything they have, because of the, but you know., i guess that's probably one of the things that come with the lawn so, when i smoke, when i see too much of it, i just pull back, um, uh, um, uh.., to go for your dream, believe in what you do, don't let anyone discourage you., and you'll be fine, and that's how i feel now that it's evolved itself., very proud of the, i think my.., mean my kind of spiritual relationship that you know and my my peace about, not too anxious, about <bout> things that can walk around me and see that you know that there are no mistakes that really happen, and you shouldn't really uh, i'm proud to be

371,"yes, i'm doing pretty good thank you, i was born in the san fernando valley in california, really, uh i love the beaches, i like uh there's just many things to do, and uh you can't beat the weather, uh, traffic cost of living, uh no i haven't uh, i've only been out of the country once, or a few times actually but only to one other country, mm, well, they were when i was younger before i turned twenty one and we used to uh, go to tijuana across the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that, uh well i love to see new things new places uh and uh have new experiences, uh after high school i went to beauty school, for cosmetology, mm, well at the time i was uh, looking for a career change and uh, i have some friends in the industry and uh, i decided to take the classes and see see what i thought, uh, only as a hobby, mm, well uh, that's a that's a tough one to answer i'd have to think about that, i would be on the outgoing side, uh just because, i'm more outgoing than i am shy <laughter>, uh lotta times i smoke marijuana, mm, not the best, uh, i had an argument with my mother over, uh, how we should handle doing things with my grandmother, well we just had differences on, uh, who should do what at what times and who's in control and uh, i should pretty much let her, uh, follow her rules because it's you know she's her daughter, well it's okay i understood we talked it out and, you know realized that uh i might've been uh, overstepping my bounds, uh it's, fairly good i am pretty close with my mom and uh my grandmother, i have a stepfather and a half-brother, we get along okay but we're not very close, and i've never met my real father, um, maybe not accomplishing as much as i, should have in my life up to now, uh, yeah maybe, by not having enough uh ambition or drive to, be in a better position in my life, uh, well one of the hardest decisions was when i moved moved uh away from los angeles to wisconsin, well when i was younger i was getting in trouble and i was looking for a way out so i, went and continued getting into trouble and i <deep breath> with a friend <sigh> uh we just packed our bags and moved to milwaukee, yes, uh extremely difficult, i guess uh, i got a lotta things going on, or not going on and it just makes it hard for me to sleep, um issues in my life, and uh, sure sometimes, mm i guess it depends on what i have to do, right now, a little, well in the last few minutes since we started talking about, depressing stuff, i starting to feel a little more down, i haven't, no, mm, very seldom, <psh> stop thinking about 'em, mm i don't know, i couldn't tell i couldn't answer that right now, um, i guess i felt uh, eh it's been awhile since i've been really happy, i don't have uh a whole lot of very happy thoughts as recently, mm, oh let's see i <sigh> did go to las vegas, uh a couple months ago, i had a good time there, well i'm a, honest person, for the most part reliable, uh, i think i'm easy to get along with, wow where do i start, i have plenty of uh, bad decisions i could, erase, um, yeah well i have a d_u_i on my record, uh well, for the time it suspended my license makes it extremely difficult <diff> makes life extremely difficult, well yeah it's uh, hard to get around when you can't drive legally, and if you do drive illegally you're at risk of going to jail, for driving without a license, uh, well the original charge did but i haven't, got caught driving, since, mm i don't have a best friend, mm, well let's come back to that one, mm maybe that i could uh, follow through with some of my plans, be a little more ambitious, maybe not, uh well <we> some of the decisions i've made in my life i have regrets, uh take care of business first, and always handle your responsibilities, good <go> uh, good weather, good music good company, good conversation, mm <sigh>, wow i don't have an answer for ya, i love to, uh, bike ride i can go for walks or hikes uh i love to swim in the ocean, mm, my mom, well she uh, she was a single mom with two kids and uh, worked really hard, to raise us, yeah yeah it wasn't easy, very, sure, bye <laughter>",9
451,", yes, okay, except for this laryngitis,, uh cleveland ohio, in uh, seventy nine, i think it was <laughter>, mhm, um, once a year, something like that or less, there's still a lot to do here., um, you're a little more narrow minded., back there and republican <laughter>, around good original show business, but probably to get away from uh, cleveland, it was very difficult at first, i'm not used to changing, i don't like changing., the commission's position is as follows , uh meet new people and, finding out how to earn a living, all right., i like, the different ways you have different health awareness, the movies around, the variety of things you can do, the places you can go the weather, to drive the traffic jams, some of the, superficial attitude, the meaning of, well, not much, but i do., i just came back from vegas, visit relatives we met there, and i'm going to mexico, next month, um, see well the different, cultures as in europe have been, greece <p>um italy, um, i like going to places like mexico, where it will be sunny and just lying down, i went to last year i went to arizona, i've never seen sedona who was really uh, an experience, purely peaceful, on sedona, yeah, that's good., good sedona is a very, energetic place and i thought it was desert like flat, a kind of desert that looks, but it was very rocky and when you land in flagstaff, there are these beautiful, uh jaws, and the height is high and coming in sedona was very beautiful and, and after a day the pain went away in my back, that i had there for months, so, and you had this, even though we went to bed late and got up early, you had that energy., so it was really.., very mystical, in life <laughter>, or in sedona in life, um, well being on stage in boston, and that was great that i loved doing that., um, just to be with friends and laugh, are some of my highest moments when we laugh hysterically, well, um.., i don't know about a particular situation, but when i decorate for special events, and, i worked regularly with someone and we just found humor in everything and, just laugh and, and, i can't imagine a particular situation or what we laughed at, but, only to be with someone who is in harmony with him, my sense of humor and uh gets, my jokes and, you know i get his and we're, just to enjoy this moment, speech and drama, i graduated from college., no, not now., i was always interested in, music comedy when i was a kid,, sing with to records in my living room, and i've always been in choirs, at school and then, if i, i went to high school and went to the drama club., and i've always had an interest and i've always had an interest, a great personality and, good <laughter>, i don't know if i have a dream job anymore., i'm sixty and, i don't know if i, continue to strive to do something, at the moment i would just rather not work <laughter> and just, um, relax and travel, but.., i like being creative, in some way i can like independence, and i kind of did it this way, i'm fine., um, i'm watching my favorite shows i recorded., and i'm also a buddhist for whom i was a buddhist, around gosh since nineteen eighty eight, and i'm, a district leader in my community, and we have meetings and that really helps,, center me and bring out my higher self, so when i get tense or nervous i get chanted, sometimes okay sometimes not, much yes yes <laughter>, less and less, although it has happened less and less, but.., yeah, sometimes he does., it's.., creating difficulties, all right., i can't <c> <sigh>, i can't remember an argument that i remember getting angry like, was just when i was on my trip to vegas, i was driving, and the g p s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane, but when i got off the highway it brought me to the ramp that went back to the highway, about four miles out of the way and i just, i got very angry about, 30 seconds and then i had to, calm down and say okay, so we'll be late, you know i had to talk myself out., so it wasn't really a fight with someone, but.., i felt somehow, bad that i overreacted, um, you mean in my life <laughter>, many, yes, um, god, there are so many <laughter>, i just wish someone would tell me that i'm disappointing., information, for example , they won't use me for a job or anything, that i, to take a position which , um, i'm gonna find something better, it's okay and, go on instead of feeling what's wrong with me, and, you know i did something wrong and then i get angry with her and, you know that, whole uh, thinking process that really doesn't help the situation, and i do it more often, but i, since i started singing, but you don't know that., i'm not always in my high life state <laughter> where, i can do this., i find a lot of situations <laughter> difficult to make as you know what, to buy tv or something <laughter> but to, um, i guess <gue> i think the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences, and, um, or to leave my comfort, area <z> place, when the decision meant that i had to leave my comfort place, that would be a very difficult decision for me, and probably leave a relationship, very hard, because, you know i'm dependent on this relationship., so that i usually, live it from til, it's for you, you know, it's, they go or something you know it's very hard for me, to make this decision that this is not right and i have to move on, so what i usually do is i don't make the decision, and in the end i suffer, but longer, so, mhm, we can continue, um, all right., it's hard., because i don't know if it's because i'm in pain., in my back, and neck, but, it's difficult for me,, stay asleep, i would, i don't get it., a deep sleep, um, but, for, well, i'm so okay it's hard to say because right now i'm having this cold and i've got it for two weeks, so i took nyquil, and that's how i fell asleep, i've.., sleep better because it, but last night i woke up on cough, so it's hard to say, but before it all happened, i was.., it's hard to find, to sleep, and that's why i'm tired during the day and, sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable, but yes, i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or, emotional things or not, i'm sorry, could you repeat that, i have studied changes in my behavior, uh no <laughter>, i had not taken, no, mm, oh, i was happy last week <laughter>, well, i.., i wanted to.., vegas up to, meeting my family was my, my family flew from cleveland to, uh there we have a, a relative in uh vegas, and i drove with my friend, and it was my brother in law's 70th birthday., so, we all went and, had a good time in vegas, i mean, i fought through my cold, but, but it was fun it was nice, good <laughter>, you think i'm funny., you feel like i'm telling you what it's like, um, they all understand and they all say they understand me like this, people who don't understand me, i sometimes don't think they know how to take me, 'cause i'm gonna, i'll say something sometimes comes to sarcastic, but only <ju> that's exactly the way i talk, so, for my.., the, anger that sometimes pops up inside me, you know i'm just.., but even though that really made me do it, i think, a lot of the person i am you know all your, experiences make you what you are, and how to deal with it, makes you who you are and when you don't have them, lows you don't really know what hochs are, so i don't., i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen, whatever, but really what matters is today and now and how you deal with today, and i wish that well i can not wish that i know that i will have less of these, moments in which i, just burst out, you know that anger or something, i just wish that would happen more less, that the anger parts would happen less, and they are so, i guess it's going to be <laughter>, less, um, don't give up hope of living at the moment, and, everything will work, everything will work, and if you think that, then you really have nothing to fear, um, the fact that now, and for the last twenty years twenty several years i have, i cultivate myself and i'm too <be>, more than, compassionate man, and i'm able to, uh, <ss> understanding people better, and see that you know that their suffering also suffers, and, the, if you are treating people, out of this respect that they, they also have their problems and they suffer with their problems too you are able to live a better life because, you don't let it affect you, you don't take it personally, and at the same time you become more compassionate and more compassionate, you are happy and your life is happy, all right.",4
442,"<sync>, sure, in a day uh pretty well except for drab weather, originally i'm from detroit michigan, yes, uh back in the eighties, yeah, uh it's been a while the last time uh it's been about five years, <laughter> uh not even close uh, <sigh> more setback uh out here it's you know you have the weather that's that's that's prominent <pr> prominent reason for coming is the weather, it does uh well maybe better opportunities, uh and the weather <laughter>, yes <sigh>, it took a minute uh had to adjust to <tisk> the uh, different attitudes of the people, the surroundings, the locations and the, vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another, um, well, the weather uh for one the never end uh uh uh it never snows in in southern california, uh two uh, the prospects of uh uh starting out a business or becoming uh, self-employed and, doing what i like to do, the people, they're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know uh back east and i'm from uh i was raised in the south, where everybody is uh cordial friendly hi when you pass in the streets out here, people think that you have uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing, so, that's what i don't like about l_a, used to uh i used to be on the road a lot i was a a truck driver and plus uh a entertainment uh coach driver for several, uh motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yes yeah, well this is a beautiful <beau> this is actually a beautiful country so just, viewing uh uh the countryside uh visiting different towns different cultures, uh different towns uh and seeing how, basically how the rest of the uh the country uh uh lives, uh some not so good some bad uh and some good um let's see, denver colorado, i lived in denver for a couple years which is uh really a great uh, uh city, uh, and then i lived in uh atlanta which is uh uh really a great state where is you know you have the southern attitude <a> a southern attitude southern attitude, which is everybody's friendly and gets along and, and, let's see, i've been back and forth across this country at least, sixteen to twenty times so, yeah it's it's been it's been it's been an adventure, <laughter>, uh arkansas, little rock, where i had to get into a uh, you might wanna say a a altercation, with the rednecks down there because as as you know um, i'm african american, and down there they're very prejudiced you know they're the uh, uh southern uh uh, uh, which what were the rebels uh not rebels but uh, what were they uh confederates they still have this uh uh tendency of thinking blacks, or any other culture besides whites aren't uh, valuable people, yeah so it i had a incident down there where it actually turned into a shoot out, but i'm okay, a little of both it it depends on it depends on the time, on the period it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know, i can be outgoing 'cause i do uh like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and, i know like i said i uh i did some entertainment before so, at clubs i'm more outgoing, in social events more shy, <laughter>, meditate, very good, very good because, uh if i let my temper get the best of me i uh tend to um, cause more, harm, than good, you know uh harm to the person harm to myself by, you know uh, physical altercations or um going to jail, and so yeah i'm very good at uh, controlling my emotions, my temper, good question, uh, okay girlfriend <laughter> uh, we just recently broke up about two three weeks ago, because of a argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do, and she wanted to do it anyway so, uh that led to a argument and the argument ended in us breaking up so yeah, it was emotional uh, but, um i'm fifty five and it's not my first break up so, i just take it in stride and and move on, uh, well it's it's probably it's, no one no no situation actually can be, i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time there's probably always a better way to handle it, after the fact, but uh, i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my wife broke up, i think i could've handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered, and more irrational so i could've handled that one better yes, what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation, well like i said uh being young and and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and, uh, not being able to communicate, with another person on the level of, of, understanding, <laughter>, hmm, leaving home, well it was like, <sigh>, what can i say, it was about, one o'clock two o'clock in the morning, and i just decided to pack up and and and leave uh without letting anyone know that i was leaving, that was like one of the hardest decisions i've had to make, sketchy, loving but sketchy uh, my family's in detroit and atlanta georgia, i'm in california l_a, i have no one out here so, uh i'm basically on my own and i've been on my own for a long time so, uh we communiate, and we talk and send, christmas cards thanksgiving cards you know and in that factor but uh as far as uh, family it's, it's, it's sketchy, no one, hm, uh, i don't know, uh most things that that i don't wanna remember i don't so and i have erased, a lot of things from my memory or, uh placed them in a closet which i can't open anymore to to remember that so, but the most thing that i can say is uh uh, i won't go into detail on it but a incident where, it caused great bodily harm to a person, in the last two weeks uh with the i've had uh, this hearburn problem so in the last two weeks it's been really difficult, for me to get uh, some sleep 'cause i have a i have uh in my pocket right now i have a a jar of tums, it's keeping me pretty uh sedated right now, irritable, um, anxious, um, need to get things done, uh, and, i feel like uh i have uh people, and things that's, against me and trying to block everything that i'm doing to succeed and that's been a great uh disturbance to me, yes it is but you know like i said i take everything it with a grain of salt, and i keep pushing because, uh you can't stay mad, or vengeful at any one person or any one thing too long because it doesn't accomplish anything so i have to keep pushing, uh no basically i'm still <s> still the same i just, just keep my thoughts <th> uh i keep my ideas that i need to do, uh and try to accomplish uh uh what i need to uh uh accomplish, post mm traumatic stress, uh no uh uh, yes, uh, back in uh, oh nine, two thousand nine, um, crying, a lot, uh, not trusting, uh suspiciousness of other people, uh so what, uh, and i was uh recommended, uh and referred to a medical uh, uh um, mental health uh facility, for treatment, off and on yes when i feel depressed and feel anxiety building up in me uh yes i still have treatment, yes because i get a chance to express uh some of the things that, i normally don't express, and i can i can like, blow off steam or uh, blow off, the anxiety part of uh my depression, hmm, well i don't know uh really really happy um, oh, when uh, well i was really really happy when, my uh the girl that i just broke up with, came from upstate, for us to be together, that's when i was really really happy, and then that turned around within two weeks but at that point in time, when that happened i was really really happy, witty, um, <laughter> witty, um informative <inf>, informative, um, um social, uh, i, basically everybody say i need i should've became a counselor because i'm very, enlightened in a lot of life's uh problems so uh, my friends would describe me as helpful, probably, education more education, not raising my sons, well, uh my son my my sons were young in age when me and my wife broke up, out here and she moved and remarried and, she has the she has the boys with her and, they took on the new husband's name, and i wasn't able to raise them like i would've wanted them raised, patience more patience, being more, acceptable of other ideas and other people's opinions, hmm, there's nothing, basically at home, watching movies to myself, i'm a loner, my sons, you're welcome, see you later, do i push the button now, why aren't you married",6
467,"<synch>, yeah i'm okay with it, uh, i feel i feel pretty good, little <l> little nervous, because i've never done anything like this before, that's why, <laughter>, yeah, from ohio cincinnati, yeah, uh two months ago, two and a half months, uh was just looking for, just wanted to be in a new environment, oh yeah i'm ecstatic, very happy, uh it took a few weeks just to get adjusted, 'cause i didn't know anyone <an>, the weather is probably the best thing, yeah and uh, i mean other than that, it's pretty much the same as everywhere else i've been, there's nothing i don't really <real> really like about l_a, it's just you know just the weather is the best part of it, yeah, uh i like to travel somewhat, uh i haven't traveled a lot in my life but over the past, uh year and a half i've done, done quite a bit of traveling, just seeing different places different people new people new faces, new places, uh <sigh>, let's see last well last summer i spent the uh summer in cleveland, <sniffle> doing uh urban farming, uh in the city, yeah and uh, i stayed at a hostel the first hostel in cleveland, , and, i was uh doing a program with the uh, , and it was basically, we would, go to different urban farms throughout the city and, volunteer, about <bout> twenty twenty five hours a week, so yeah, really a spur of the moment type of thing, um, wanted to try something different something i'd never done before, and farming is one of those things that you know most people, would never try, 'cause of a you know 'cause of a certain stigma that comes along with it, uh, and you know, i just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that, yeah, what in the uh, uh mm, urban farming or in general, in urban farming uh, i don't know i guess uh, i don't know just just the overall experience just going, you know eating uh going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and, just seeing the difference in, you know how fresh natural food taste eh you know, as opposed to the food you buy in a grocery store, yeah, yeah it is really is, uh i was i took two semesters, of uh college and i was undecided, so i was just taking general classes, my dream job, huh, i guess my dream job would to be, <ss> anything that involves <invol> uh i don't have like a specific dream job but anything that involves nature, just being outside, uh i would like to uh, i wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that, just as long as i you know, yeah, consider myself more shy, uh i don't i don't know why <laughter> it's just the way it is, uh huh, i read, um, listen to music, uh, i draw, watch movies stuff like that, yeah, i think i'm pretty good at it, i think <thi>, yeah, <deep breath> wow uh, yeah i can't remember the last time i had an argument with someone, i don't know, <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth>, again i don't know because, i don't, dwell on things that happened in the past, yeah, <laughter>, mm, maybe whether or not to come to california, i guess that was a hard decision, well, i don't know i've been thinking about it, you know moving to a new place for a long time, and <sigh> i guess, the hardest part of the decision was, thinking whether, whether or not i would be, secure or not, you know what i mean, um, just going to a new place where you don't know anyone, uh, it's kinda, uh you really don't know what's gonna happen, so, uh, there was a lot of uh, you know, fear in that, in that decision of, should i go to a place where i don't know anyone i don't i'm not familiar with the area, you know, only, only perception ever had <ha> that i have of this area is, you know what i've seen on in media media and t_v, so you know, eh yeah guess that was, hardest hardest decision <deci> decision that i can think of, yeah, eh guess so, uh nothing absolutely nothing, yeah, uh, nothing, i don't feel guilty about anything, uh relationship with my family uh, i'm not really close to my family, um i guess the person, i'm closest to is my mom but you know i don't you know i don't i never really talk to her much, uh, i don't really know my dad that well so, you know, <makes clicking sounds with mouth>, <whistling softly>, <whistling softly>, uh, i guess my grandmother, yeah she, yeah she's uh, she's very um, how should i say it uh, she's very, she's a thinker, i put it like that like she's very insightful, so, um, yeah i look to her, for a lot of advice because, she's been through a lot through a lot in her life, and i feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot, so eh you know, she's a very positive influence, very easy, uh, maybe unsure, i would say, because, right now i really don't know, what direction i wanna go in with my life, and there's been a lot of confusion with that, um, but, you know it's not, it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind it feels <feel> feels like, somehow, maybe i'm running out of time, and i know that's not like that's not that's not a realistic thought because, i don't see how you could ever run out of time, but, yeah i guess yeah, just general, not knowing what i want, but i know like, how do i cope with that, how do i cope with that i uh, i don't know i just do a lot of thinking, a lot of soul searching, it's not hard i mean, i mean i'm, it's , like i can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that, i feel like it's necessary, and, you know certain things in life you just, you're forced to face, so, it's harder to i think it's harder to avoid, those type of things, yeah, no, no, no, uh, today, when i talked when i uh talked to my friend earlier, yeah, how would my best friend describe me, uh i guess he would say i'm quiet, uh, uh, guess he would describe as a nice guy, uh, guess insightful, mm, uh goofy, and, yeah, oh i don't really think like that, no, ten or twenty years ago, uh guess i would tell myself to, stick with what what stick with what i love, hmm, uh i did uh, acting workshop, in um, , yeah, i don't know it's always <al> always been an interest of mine, and i decided why not, you know just try it, see how you like it, what am i most proud of, like an event or a an accomplishment, i guess i pride myself on being independent, mm, yeah, bye",0
404,"yes, doing good, new york city, all right., originally i was born here, but uh, he spent some time in the east and moved back here and.., basically raised here so, have been here for a while and i enjoy it, there's great weather and.., uh amusement parks a lot of landscape a lot of people, lots of energy and excitement, there are so many things you can really like about l a., see uh a lot of congestion and pollution, i'm trying, but no, i'm not., uh, it's nice to be on the open road with uh, mm potentially <potelingly> time to think about my own life, shy, sometimes it's hard for me to express my own thoughts, well, you mentioned a fish tank and uh, i see spent some time in a, many waiting rooms where there were fish tanks and uh, uh so staring at fish tanks could be one of them, uh but i also enjoy walking or, uh lifting weight reading go in movies just to say a few things, uh, good., moderate.. good.., under control, argued about today's okay last argument was today, just before i got here, and it was, about, with over, how do i say this about driving to a bus stop over uh, how uh make an agreement, feel guilty about, don't take better care of my pet, sure i like birds, so one of my pets was a bird, uh from recently, and, i, let my bird out into the wilderness, and, i wish i had planned it better., um, future for the bird, just because i want the bird now., was closer to me, hm, i'd say, i'm having a fight with people close to me, and, sometimes i don't do well with them., i'm more, reactive, so i'd like to see how this improves., uh no, at least you don't know about any legal difficulties, but.., i think you know it's kind of, not as i would have liked to have treated., guess the toughest decision was just before, of, how to, continue with, further development, a, employment opportunities, i had to, decide whether or not to , if i would, suffer more emotional pain by leaving, my family and whether the financial gain and, knowledge, this experience would outweigh the benefits, yes i am, well, it's a small family, but.., have a mother and a, uh sister and a brother, and two younger nieces, older they are adult adults, it's a good relationship., and, uh, things could be better, sometimes it's a kind of difficult pain., scatching, uh relationship sometimes, there are a few days when i, i need time for myself and i, would rather give the time to, other people instead of taking time for me what my experience was, uh, and so on., this has caused me very emotional, pain uh a little spiritual, uh fear for my future if i keep doing something like this, wow there are so many things <laughter> what about you i know nothing about you, i'd say there's some.., but of the most recent, all right., things are going pretty well, i'm, can't really say that there's something else i can really change or regret that i can remember, it was pretty good., and uh, i'd say it's okay., i'll take good care of my sleep., when i don't sleep well sometimes i can be irritable around, sometimes it's okay uh, and uh would say if, there are also times when i am, unhappy, so, i'm trying to, getting as much sleep as i need, yes, i, i think i was uh nineteen, and uh, i'm glad i did., yeah, yeah, that's good., somehow, but yes., no, um, uh, um, uh.., i suppose it made me a more confident person and more, um, in accordance with uh, the land in which i live and the people, uh, to be more noticeable watch where i live, to hang out with some friends uh, on a really nice weekend and uh on a boat, uh or on a skiff a really small boat and around, try to fish in, i felt free or alive to be happy, around uninhibited, uh strong confident uh mature, after the military, uh after the military, took some time to get my, my thoughts and uh, my future and around, i have only taken the necessary steps to make progress., it's kind of hard, it's, um, it wasn't easy., a lot of family uh help and around and community, and uh, so it needed some adjustment, but it wasn't easy, uh no, no, you know., this week, partially today, happy., uh happy kind often not too happy, but, contents, happy, happy, i don't know, uh not usually too happy, try to stay, on the centre line, make a weekend, um, get up early, to get out enjoy the day around, along with a few friends, and uh, a little socializing, and uh, maybe you get a kind of uh, consider a form of artistic expression, there may be one like a museum or uh staring at some art or, uh maybe something in the local community, maybe street art, and uh, or maybe something with music or, uh, something of this nature, i wish i could change a few things about myself., make, more decisive in decision making, and uh something else uh, that i, had the same ability for a crack for, uh meet for more people, i suppose, as best friends i don't know about, nice friendly, uh, trustworthy sociable, uh, the same advice i would give myself today <laughter>, something wow, uh, i really enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and her two children, and that was yesterday, and i'm glad i did it, that it was a good time for everyone, i'm proud that i went to the military and.., i'm glad it was a good experience, see you, thank you.",0
356,"yes, all right., from here anyway from alhambra, the weather is really nice and everything is very familiar, uh sometimes there's too much traffic jam on the roads too much traffic, i studied art and photography, it wasn't so much a decision that i kept noticing that i was very interested in it., yes, i'm a photographer., mhm, oh, i suppose, uh, um, run a family portrait studio or any other type of photography business, uh no i'm also an apartment manager it keeps me tied, it's fair that it's not the best because it's an apartment manager., i have a free rent, but i have to stay., there's a lot, so , that part does the free rental part is very good, oh, god!, my most memorable experience, that's hard to say, um , all right., i mean, there are good and bad unforgettable experiences, oh, well, i guess some s like sports success when i was in high school, there were some of the things i was happy about, and, some works of art i made were unforgettable, and, some bad things would be the death of my father, you know, but these are very memorable not good though, uh , well, my parents and my i have a lot of brothers and sisters, uh so that my family, uh pretty close, but most of them live around l a, there are a few who come from far <f>, away <di> uh away my brother lives in new york and, my other brother lives in maui <free throat>, mhm, oh, mostly very talented, <ss> just to get more involved in the technology than maybe i was, or i am and they are about, i think they're more of a hive ghost than when i grew up, looks like they're all entangled in social media., go for a walk or, watching tv, or play with my computer, and uh, uh, good., there are some <so> some, uh , there's a kind of uh, injustices that do not happen, no big deals, but for example our parking situation deteriorated with some new district parking, that's kind of disturbing and the city doesn't seem to want to, uh make any exceptions or change some rules, and also uh some unfair things sometimes happen at work, the riots are <ups>, uh, who're annoying, nope., i worked for <f> at school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this past weekend and when we arrived at the site, people on the premises said we couldn't do all our gear and scenery and things in the place where we were assigned to do it, that we were going outside, and then get an ok to go in because we weren't prepared outside, nor even said in advance that we should be outside, it delayed our setup time and that wouldn't have bothered me, except that on monday morning the school called our boss and complained., that we set up too late when they told us, to wait for them and we told them we would delay when we wait and we still have a complaint, so this part is annoying and, and our work doesn't support those in the office they need to please the school to keep the account., uh often, when something like that happens, it means that they won't send you to work at this school again, which would translate into less pay hours for the photographers who were in this job, yeah, that's how they do things., so that this is disturbing, uh most of the time i dust from my resume <laughter> and look for other situations that, this could be better, um , yeah, that's good., uh pretty good <sigh> i usually , i could the moment i don't really lose it, but later i could.., but right now i wouldn't do that, um, we have a tight schedule today and i have a friend with whom i share a car., we argued where to go first., and so we compromised and, has most of her stuff and one of my stuff then after, that was one of the things that are over, then we're gonna do more of their stuff., but it, yeah, that's good., no, post traumatic stress syndrome is that what, uh, no i didn't, yes, oh, i'd say nineteen eighty, yes, i think it was nineteen eighty., yeah, that's good., um, well, my father noticed some symptoms, my father is just good, he died, but he was a psychiatrist, um, well, i wasn't sleeping, i was lying around the house, to wake me up at, at noon, something like that, and i didn't have a.., focus like for a job it wasn't clear enough, i remember a few job interviews that i would go to her front door and then i wouldn't go into <laughter> and i think that was all part of the depression, yeah, i thought i had a problem, but i didn't know what it was., no, all right., i went for three years, and then the psychiatrist said,, he thought i was finished <laughter> but uh, and i and i came to a much better place that i have to watch all the time to see what's going on, with depression, so i think i'll have good and bad days, um, i think the therapy will let you see what.., as i thought it would be as a filter or with a pair of <pa> as if you weren't really looking for a depression pair of sunglasses, you see everything through this, so you have to somehow <k> i have to somehow, try to take out the glasses for a little and double check i'm really aware of these things exactly, or see it through a depressed view, and i'm trying to find clues about it, i think i'm.., a bit slip backwards uh uh i don't do well during the unemployed periods, i have noticed on my way in my past and around the moment we have a work slower, so it is easy to slip back into sleep too late or expose things because the schedule is too far open for, for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important, it's.., it takes you out of bed and you have to go somewhere in time and, deal interaction with people is all these are all useful things for someone who tends to be depressed, uh , well, i don't know if it's changes, how i tend to be a little focused on some things that are, probably not that uplifting we say uh, but it's rather negative like i, have had <ha> somehow thought about how to, um, soldiers in the past uh i don't know why, but how the ancient greeks during the roman era or the greeks would have been in a frontline fight with, mm, they know only raw <cru> type of raw <cru> in my opinion raw weapons and no medical help and, that i don't know, i seem to be going a lot where i'm thinking about it and i've seen it and read books about it or about video clips on youtube and, eh things like this or, some other things <thi> other uh somehow like terrible doom type subjects as i watched on the animal show like crocodile attacks and such things, where should probably not be so much on that, oh, you mean well in life in general, i think i'm sorry i didn't finish college, i think i was <wa>, uh went into depression right then and wasn't coping very well in my last year, and to not really, i didn't come out of college with a degree even though i was there seven years, but uh, that's very that's a big regret that i've had, um , i think it would be.., at certain points i would probably have been looking for therapy and also probably some, uh outside help only to get through the finals only the logistics, i had i was an art major and i didn't have a car like this, many of the art projects and things were hard to move back and forth and, and also to meet uh in distant places i think it would probably have been worth, do whatever was necessary to get a car at that time, so , um , i was told that i was very patient., and i also have some original artistic ideas, so , these are, these are good qualities, which i am very loyal and also, you know, i support my friends, i'm pretty generous with them., so, yeah, that's good., let's see., really enjoyed was i had a, i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing around a football game recently, i really enjoyed that so, mhm, all right., it's been a pleasure., thank you very much.",10
363,", yes, all right, how are you?, i'm from los closeles, yes, um, it's uh center of everything anyway you drive to all the places you need to uh eh without being very far, i like being in town, all right., in l a you are also dealing with traffic a lot of traffic jams, and around obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not so big, but, you know you live with it, i was a business manager, so i studied economics and.., after i finished college, uh pursued a career in retail, uh no i'm actually not i'm kind of a changed career, over the last four or five years, so i focus more on the company's staff side., a few factors around i after many years in the retail trade, i switched and worked in a uh creative business that was a graphic design company and i uh caught a knowledge < knowledge> a lot of knowledge about, in the a in the personnel page because i was the company manager slash benefits manager for a small company, yes, i'm very happy that i did that, and i've collected a lot of knowledge and uh, and it's very helpful, < slaughter>, well, my dream job is.., i'm basically doing what i want to do now because i'm a uh., independent contractor i do freelance work as a consultant with all the knowledge i gained from previous jobs, and i use that with the flexibility to do the things i want to do as far as personal and have the time i need to do the things i want to do, and obviously i have worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already in place so, i do what i need to do as far as to get a certain lifestyle, but also i also enjoy what i do, i'm not under as much stress as i used to be, mm, i'm not, well, i'm not quite out, but i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm, probably right in the middle maybe more towards going out, but i'm not completely starting out i mean, when i'm with other people, i'm in a social situation, i guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but.., obviously i have my own little uh private problems that i hold for myself, oh, sure you know i'm.., a few years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass surgery and it had to, yes, it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about much other than those around me that are close to me., when i meet someone new, i'm not just saying openly that you know that i've experienced this and that, so basically, i'm just.., when it comes, i won't deny it, or when it comes and when it is, when it feels like it's something i'm going to talk about, in fact,, my relaxation is up, i'm just around, living with my mother my mother and uh she's an elderly citizen and she's alone around what i do to relieve uh relaxation or stress is i actually help her to work yard, take care of all the gardening and such things and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know,, i'm not.., i'm not, it takes a lot to make me really angry as far as my temper is concerned., there's not much to it., um, i'm trying to think here, i can't remember the last time it was, but it was probably sometime last year when i had a creditor i was dealing with., very difficult to work with to, and i owed money as far as some medical expenses that had occurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh, they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh uh i was really a little upset about it because, i felt like i was being honest with them and i was more than willing to take care of my problems, but uh, they played hardball and i didn't care about it., it does <laughter>, probably the toughest decision i ever had to make was to, it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who fought against uh prostate cancer and, yes uh a decision to make with my mother whether using a procedure that was either to help him, or there was an easy chance that it would help him even though he was pretty much at the end at this point, or it would kill him you know, and that was really hard, it was really hard to make decision, but uh uh you know, i, i felt like i wasn't trying to see if we could save his life <l> helping to save his life or if we weren't taking any chances and taking this extra step that i would regret in the long run, it's, it was, um, i'm separated from my wife, so she has her problems, i have my problems, but we're not divorced, we're just separated., and we still have a relationship in which we still talk, we just don't live together., and the relationship with my mother is really great, you know, she's very understanding i'm a single child so, she likes to have me what is good because she is eighty two years old in her late she at her later stage of her life, and, and so she must, i guess it's a good thing that fate may have happened in its own way, because you know anyway,, someone eighty two years old alone in a huge house is not a good thing, but with me because i think she feels <fe> it's a comfort level she feels at me because especially her only child, probably the most guilty i feel about anything are the things i did to hurt my marriage, um, as far as.., the things i did the selfish things i did when i was much younger, which obviously influenced the relationship between me and my wife, oh, yeah, i.., in a situation in which , to make me work enormous amounts of hours under a lot of stress my wife also worked a lot of hours in a job that she had and uh we grow apart, and when she was gone, my form of release was, uh, going to the casinos and playing and so, you know, i spent a lot of time at the casinos, and what happened was that i spent a lot of money., and obviously this was an important topic in relation to our relationship, had to do with trust because to, it was devastating for my wife, i felt when it came to light, i felt very guilty, and i felt less than a person at this point in my life, no, not at all., no not really no, i have no problems sleeping, that's i can never remember having any problems, so no, no, not at all, no, i'm good i just < deep breath> the only thing i could say is, after i had my heart attack a few years ago, i won't let the little details or little things in my life bother me the way i used to., so i tend to be a little easier and my friends and family have noticed that, the last time i felt really happy, um, probably, if, i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack, and, he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that, he was glad to explain that there was no scar tissue., no larger scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart attack, and that i could count on a fairly normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medication, well, i guess number one is uh, my physical being itself, i may be a little healthier to lose some more weight, um, just generally just be healthier physically, and as far as mental for just not, go back to those ways of thinking where i did the wrong things instead of the right things and not being so selfish, only one day at a time, you know i just.., try to be at peace with myself and try to have a little rest on a daily basis, i'm meditating, i'm reading, you know, i'm reading a few books, i'm watching to do things i know when i can, when i can help myself, i do things to help myself, well, there's a lot i obviously regret in my marriage, uh my uh professional career, as far as i've had a long career with this majors uh food chain and, and i basically ended up ruining a very good career because of my gambling problems, but, um, at this point at the moment there's not much i can do, i can't change what has been done, so i don't focus too much on the past, i'm just looking at what's in front of me and just focusing on what's in front of me., what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing, for yourself and you know, make the changes that need to be changed, you know i'm not., i'm not someone who's not intelligent, but i was smart enough to know what's right and.., , you are what you do is wrong, you need to change your behavior immediately, likely, the proud thing i'm proud of is the fact that, i've done all these terrible things, but deep down, i don't think i'm a bad person as a person i need to remember., when i was trapped in all this gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because i had a disease, a compulsive, uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me sick and that i was a sick person trying to get better, and every day what my life is about it is about recovery and uh, i'm just making sure i do the right things, from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night., one day at a time, it's not as hard as you think it is, but it's a process in which, you must be diligent about your behavior and routines, and just to know that what's not right for you, you know that it might be okay for other people to do certain things, but i can't do those things anymore., most of my best friends can describe me as likely, generous and generous, to be a nice person to be near, and, you know, they were obviously a little shocked when they found out about all my problems., uh in connection with gambling and the, mine and the separation from my marriage you know it's not over, you know., well, my ideal weekend usually starts around, after having breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock, i'm going to a local park and it's about, this park is probably set up where you can go up a hill and down a hill it is about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning, um, my blood is flowing and my heart rate starts and then after that.., you know you're going home., work in the yard a few hours, shower and relax and then, just uh somehow step back for the rest of the day and then the next day i do the same in the morning again i go for a walk, train in the yard, watch t v whatever easy relax, so goes a weekend for me, and thank you, see you.",0

her come out., she looked at me right out of her stomach <laughter> she wouldn't fight with the doctors wouldn't let her touch a little bit, i talked to her, i told her to calm down, or i told her it

congestion and pollution, i i try to but no i don't, uh, it's nice to be on the open road with uh, mm potentially <potelingly> time to think about my own life, shy, sometimes i find it hard to express my own thoughts, well you mentioned a fish tank and uh, i view spent some time in a, many waiting rooms where there's been fishtanks and uh, uh so staring at fishtanks could be one of them, uh but i also enjoy walking or, uh lifting weights reading going to movies just to say a few things, uh good, moderate uh good um, in control, argued about today okay last argument was today, just before i got here, and it was, about um, having about how do i say this about taking them to a bus stop about uh, how uh making an arrangement, feel guilty about, not taking better care of my pet, sure i i like birds so one of my pets was a bird, uh as of recently, and, i, let my bird out into the wild, and, sort of wish i had planned for better, um, future for the for the bird, uh only because now i sort of wish the bird, was uh closer to me, hm, i would say, i get into arguments with people close to me friends, and, sometimes i i don't handle them well, i am more, reactive, so i wish uh i'd like to see myself improve on that, uh no, um at least not you know in any sort of legal trouble but uh, i think it's you know it's kind of, not the way that i would like to have handled it, guess the hardest decision was about to, of, how to, proceed with, moving forward eh on, a, job opportunity, i had to, decide whether, if i would, suffer more emotional pain by leaving, my family and whether the financial gain and, uh knowledge, of that experience would over outweigh the benefit, uh yes yes i am, well i it's a small family but um, have a mother and a, uh sister and a brother, and uh two younger nieces, older they're they're grown adults, uh it's a it's a good relationship, and, uh, things could be better, um sometimes it's sort of difficult pain, staking, uh relationship at times, there's uh some days i'm, i need time for myself and i, would rather give the time to, other people rather than to take time for myself which has been my experience, uh and so, that has caused me a lot me a lot of emotional, pain uh a little bit of spiritual, uh anxiety about my future if i continue to do that sort of thing, wow there's so many things <laughter> what about you i don't know anything about you, i would say uh well there's there's a few um, but of recent i um, well, things are going pretty good i'm, can't really say there's anything as of yet that i would really want to change or or have anything to regret on that i can remember, it's been pretty good, and uh, it's uh i'd say it's okay uh, i'm handling my sleep pretty well, when i don't sleep well sometimes i can be irritable um, sometimes it's okay uh, and uh would say if, there's also times where i'm, unhappy, so, i try to, get as much sleep as i need, yes, i, believe i was uh nineteen, and uh, i'm glad i did it, yes uh, sort of but uh yes, no, um well uh, i guess i suppose it made me a more confident person and more, um, in tune with uh, uh the country that i'm living in and people, uh, to be more noticeable more watchful of where i live, um hanging out with some friends uh, on a really nice weekend and uh on a boat, uh or on a skiff a really small boat and um, trying to fish in, i felt uh free or alive um happy, um uninhibited, uh strong confident uh mature, after the military, uh after military, took some time to evaluate my, my thoughts and uh, my future and um, just sort of took uh the necessary steps uh to move ahead, uh it's sort of hard it is, um, uh it wasn't easy uh, a lot of family uh help and um and community, and uh, so it took some adjusting but it wasn't easy, uh no, no, uh you know, this week um, partially today, happy's, uh happy sort of often not too happy but, content, happy, happy, i don't know uh not usually too happy, try to stay, on the center line, do a weekend, um up early, um get out enjoy the day um, hook up with some friends, and uh, doing a little bit of socializing, and uh, maybe get some form of uh, view some form of artistic expression, there's a maybe a like a museum or uh stare at some art or, uh maybe something in the local community, maybe street art, and uh, or perhaps something with music or, uh, something something of that nature, i wish perhaps uh some things that i could change about myself um, make, more decisive about decisions, and uh something else um, that i, had the same ability for a knack for, uh for meeting more people i suppose, as best friends describe me i don't know um, nice friendly, uh, trustworthy sociable, uh, the same advice i'd give myself <laughter> today, something wow, uh, i really enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and her two children, and that was yesterday, and i'm glad i did that it was a good time for everybody, uh i'm proud i went into the military and um, i'm glad i did that it was a good experience, bye thank you",0
381,"yes, okay, from santa monica, uh the people, mostly, uh no not a lot, well i can't afford to travel as much as i'd like to, mm i was an english major, uh i just liked reading a lot at the time so, it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study, no not anymore, oh i guess my dream job would be to, manage a uh soccer club, oh it'd be pretty much impossible for me, um i don't have any experience <laughter> in that field, i'm very shy, i play music, <sigh> what do i do when i'm annoyed, i don't know, um, what do i do when i'm annoyed, i can't think of anything i don't know, i don't think yeah i don't do anything specifically, uh pretty good i would say very good i don't lose my temper very often, mm when was the last time i argued with someone, <sigh> i can't remember uh, yeah i don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i argued with someone, well let's see when i was um, a little kid, i was outside my grandparents' uh restaurant, and there was a robbery and i saw it i well i saw it when when the robbers were leaving, um, yeah maybe i would want to erase that from my memory if i could, well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel, so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then, um, you know my mother was upset by it my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was, it was disturbing to see her, you know really disturbed that way but, at the time that it actually happened i wasn't really upset it was more the the aftermath of it, mm it was <wa> it was, <sigh> situation that, i don't know um, well i can think of um there's probably a million situations that i would've <laughter> i wish i would've handled differently i can't think of one in particular, um, maybe, i think that when i was a kid i um, well i think that when i was let's see, well i have okay i have a good one, um, i didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married, so, that's a big one for me, yeah well, we <w> we were together for about four years, and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didn't uh commit, and um, that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that, that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other, but because, my selfishness and because i just uh, had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh, i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been, well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was, no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend, as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh, how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't, i never feel like i can help anyone, who i know who has a problem so, oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone, all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't, feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know, well they're um, it's very distant it's it's just, it's very cordial and it's very uh, uh i don't know what the word is it's on the, it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all, and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense, so, yeah it's it's, i think a lot of families are that way but it it is, it does bother me that mine is that way, oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um, yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all, no not not really i would say, they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so, even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and, no i don't think i've i've changed much, mm pretty down, but like i said, in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again, i've always been this way so, it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way, yes, a long, oh a long time ago i was um, about ten years old or, around there about, uh i was just missing a lot of school, i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to, to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh, it went from there, no i haven't gone to therapy, since i was a teenager, well, i didn't feel it was helping me at all, so, one day i just, decided i didn't wanna go anymore, eh, uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um, so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much, no i wouldn't say, disturbing, no, mm, well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew, and uh i have a, my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them, uh my ideal weekend would be um, i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would, really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um, eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city, uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and, how they interact with you and how they see the world, different food, um, and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a, historical significance, oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um, the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding, and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town, um, that's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was, and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so, yeah it was a really cool trip, <sigh> like i don't know i don't <laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable, uh, a memorable experience, probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be, nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now, that we should've, gotten married, um, that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because, it's it's still with me and um, eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any, mm particular day or any particular moment you know, oh a lot um, wish i could be healthier, for one thing uh more energetic, and um, more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly, but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social, um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more, and healthier, oh that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think, i think he would say that i'm, a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person, and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish, um, and probably he would say that i'm creative also, <sigh> wow, well my advice to to myself, i don't understand the question <laughter>, yeah but we already talked about it, nah i can't uh well i don't think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride, um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of, any accomplishment, anyway even if i did have something <laughter> to be proud of no i can't think of anything <anythi> any sort of accomplishment i've had, uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed, well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine, <laughter> and i don't usually do that but, yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago, thank you, nan, nan, nan, nan",16

experiencing different things, seeing different cultures, well i was stationed in germany for three years it was a great experience, food was great, bavarian alps the snow, the people, i loved it, having a baby, well it was just the most memorable thing in my life something i'll never forget, great, one son, grown, handsome, father of two, no, it's actually very hard for me, not becoming angry, too quickly, being able to cultivate, a mind, love someone unconditionally, well i went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent i was very afraid for my child to go through that same trauma, tried to protect him from it, i think it's really hard 'cause you never really know people what they'll do, outgoing, because if i'm in a room with people i'm usually, the first one to start talking, as a matter of fact i have fish aquarium, that's what, keeps me calm, not very good, <laughter> seems like everyday i argue with somebody about something but yesterday, um a lady tried to cut line, in the grocery store and i politely told her i was in line and, she didn't wanna move, yes it has, because sometimes if people don't want to move then i feel it's my place to move them, hurting people physically, uh if i feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me i can get very ugly, i don't like that about me, um, i was pulled over by the police and they had uh, someone with my name and they were very rude to me and, i really wasn't happy with the way they treated me, um, how to, stay calm when, someone has, crossed over into my boundary, my personal space, i can't let people get too close to me if they do i i lash out, i don't want anybody in my area of, protection i guess, stay away from people, <laughter>, stay away from, it's hard you can't live in this world without other people, sometimes they just irritate the heck out of me, being assaulted in the military is something i wish i could forget, just that i felt, helpless alone ashamed and angry, that's about all i wanna go into, eighteen, yeah, very young, no, because i was assaulted and, and i have a fear of, people in uniform, like the policemen hurting me or um, other military veterans, hurting me when they, explode or go off or, have issues of, p_t_s_d, i can't remember, i worked for the federal government, well it just seemed like a normal progression um, federal government gives you ten points preference over other people for being in the military so, it seemed like a natural choice, a organization that had a book of rules and they followed them, the government one government to another, yes, well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're given um, you're told to handle it handle it, and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and, different people to talk to to get something done, administration of justice, no um i don't work anymore, oh yeah, almost two years, the feeling that i was, always gonna be hurt that someone was out to get me, i had nightmares panic attacks, anxiety attacks, outburts <out>, outburts of anger, i was always in emotional pain, and i always wanted to hit somebody, yes mostly disrespect but i feel it's disrespect of people getting too close to me or, i feel in fear of them for some reason, i can't remember the last time i had a good night's sleep, what, irritable angry moody pissed off, irrational, tired, sick of the world angry at the world, wanting to be left alone, sometimes i don't wanna go on, yes, oh yeah <laughter> oh yeah, well i i could recognize a trigger now when something is gonna trigger me i can at least, know, and uh, act accordingly if i want to <laughter>, when i saw my grandchildren when they came to visit, <sniff>, they're just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around they, make me forget about all the pain in life, <sniff>, <sniff>, planting seeds for some vegetables making a garden, <sniff>, i read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt, so i decided to find out <sniff> plant something and watch it grow, <sniff>, sitting on the beach looking <look> facing the water, thinking talking to god, wishing i were somewhere else, like hawaii, penthouse over maui, that i could trust people, that i wouldn't lash out at them, that i could sleep at night, <sniff>, crazy, hot headed <sniff>, emotional, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, don't trust anyone, be careful be wary of people and what they want from you, my son, my grandchildren, <sniff>, i don't have a a real family i don't haven't seen my

you're not programmed with this knowledge but uh katrina happened in two thousand five, not really, um, hmm where to begin, uh just l_a's different culturally, i have a different culture out here, it's just a different place, um it's it's bike friendly, louisiana isn't, new orleans for that matter really isn't, now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful, <sigh> the drivers they're crazy, mm not really kind of but not much anymore, don't have the money kinda broke <laughter>, just being able to go on an adventure, um, let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike, um and that that was pretty fun, kinda scary and dangerous, nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>, traveling or just in general, hmm, um, i gotta say, i gotta say we were, we were heading out of um, we were, heading off the p_c_h and going into um, laguna, and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic, and i i remember going down, the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click, and i was like oh god, and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic, going down a hill, unable to brake, and i'm going down, and suddenly, there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i, turn, sharply, in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic, and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes, and like not managing to keep my bike from, rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot, so yeah, yeah that's it, <laughter>, um, various different things uh anthropology visual effects, kinda weird but yeah, um, i just i've always had a fascination with film, and, i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating, just as like the the mob mentality of people, especially, ooh dream job, um, huh, i have no idea, just a job i guess, i consider myself more outgoing, um, you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me, like people i i i like people i don't know, i'm not, i'm not afraid of what they think, eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me, i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really, affect me, eh, um, <deep breath> <mumbling> <sigh> uh i play video games listen to music, um, yeah read books i like reading books and drawing, reading books drawing playing video games, did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping, i like sleeping it's fun, uh <mumbling> not good, <laughter> frequently <laughter>, um, <sigh>, uh, in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker, um, yeah, yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker, that's a great way to get suspended, um, i don't know, yeah things like that just, getting into fights, <sigh>, um, like a serious argument, um <sigh>, uh, i guess like, , argument over, over, um, uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control, and gun control laws, i mean, it was like, yesterday evening, eh it was, it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally, but that was like the last argument i got into, that that's kinda what you specified i think, ooh, um, uh my entire life um, <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh>, i have, um, about, two years ago i broke up, with like as everyone calls her my evil ex, and um, yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean, uh, eh, <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then, like just as a person as a whole, but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like, a hundreds plus miles in a singular day, and i was in a ton of pain, like, later in the evening i got home i was like oh god, like i could barely walk um, and yeah i i think running off and, like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like, eating too much and like, just, overeating 'cause i was depressed, but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death, <deep breath> <sigh> hmm, um, i don't think i've had a singular hard decision, i've had ever had to make, because, my my biggest thing, in life, is don't you know don't regret, don't regret, the the the things you do, just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me, that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years, like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept, and to answer your question, i think thinking about it, the hardest decision i've had to make, is, i'd say, probably, probably to break up with my ex probably, um, <sigh> ooh, um <sigh> where do i begin, <sigh>, um, my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word, um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with, um just to the the people around her and to me, and, i, <deep breath>, <laughter> you know, they say you're supposed to give forgive people, for making mistakes or doing things, and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for, no matter how hard you try, and i think there are some things that once done, that that can't be, undone they just they're they're the way that they are, and i think, i think after what she did, i i like i just , eh, things just fell apart after that it just it it we, mm despite us trying, it just it didn't work out, i mean, i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened, oh geez, oh man, erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening, um, huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard, um, katrina, just the experience of katrina for starters, um <laughter> my <m> my ex, i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina, 'cause that was just that that was not, i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um, in two thousand five um, uh this giant storm hit, uh, new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people, leveled the town, um, and um, i i lost a lot of friends during the storm, um, i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it, but, it's still, it's it's still there, and i think, uh i i don't know i mean, you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive, in that but there's just there's nothing the only, thing you can do, is <i> is, just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again, though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know, <laughter> earthquakes, <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather, rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming, yes, <laughter> yeah, <sigh> um, mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times, that's no surprise, um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school, um which would've been, <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago, i don't know , i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's, it's when i first was told that i was depressed, um, as far as p_t_s_d goes, um post katrina, um, and then, you know, uh just, post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing, um, i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school, it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school, and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it, um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it, um, you know, just kinda happened, no not not anymore, um, eh, <sigh>, <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter>, uh geez uh you know i really don't know, i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore, uh sometimes, sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today, and stuff and, you know, it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but, ask me in two hours and who knows, you know, um, <sigh>, i guess, it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen, and to just get on and move along with your life, um, mm essentially just, mm like carry on you know, things will happen carry on, <sigh>, um, wow <laughter> um, uh i was um, i was hanging out with my girlfriend just, hanging out, um, well for starters i mean, you <y> you can't, see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently, and uh i'd i'd make my leg better, um, let's see cane's over there, that way but anyway um <sigh>, i don't know, uh make myself less fat, <laughter>, um, i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day, um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time, like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that, i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good, like you can sleep six, you know, like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with, seven, or eight, you know, like, that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours, it's just, i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too, i mean, yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much, um, <sigh>, um, utterly insane in a good way, utterly insane in a good way, um, uh i guess, like they they would also, say like you know, there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just, you know, i i just have issues like everybody else, um specifically i have, uh asperger's so that's a form of autism, um that just kinda makes life awesome, they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric, 'cause i totally am, i just, i i don't know, i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive, and you know, who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for, so i should you know, live while i'm alive and just, go out and do stuff and not, not sit and be calm, except when i'm reading, and i like reading, <sigh>, um, uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up, um, i think, i would've told myself at the time, um, 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known, my my evil ex, um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five, i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl, don't trust her she can't be trusted, um and more importantly, don't, <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that, and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally, um, yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain, it's not worth it, <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive, maybe, yeah, uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it, um, just, i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride, i don't really feel pride, i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>, i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane, who knows, do i press the button now, oh bye, okay",15
323,"sure , good, chicago , it's cold in chicago , hmm, oh i think in ninety nineteen eighty nine actually , oh very simple very easy , oh weather of course and i'm so easily, located to san diego palm springs las vegas san francisco and things i like to do, smog of course is bad , crime rate's higher than it should be, um , and financial economic problems here , every year thanksgiving , very very much so we're a very big family , yes i do very much in fact, i love flying on airplanes i love visiting new places i even like visiting different airports everyone's different , ooh let's see , i started off in, pre-med haha i ended up in uh physics, yes i am i teach <tea> i teach physics , and math and higher level math , well i enjoy working with kids , i enjoy teaching my mother was a teacher uh my dad was a truant officer, and uh i've enjoyed it, keeps you young , my dream job , my dream job would be to be a judge , yes, in in the uh , youth court that would be fantastic but i should've thought of that sooner than now so i'm not gonna be able to do that , no <laughter> not at all , um i enjoy people being around people i'm very talkative at times uh , i like to do a lot of things and i'm very social when i do them , uh believe it or not i play bridge i play chess and i watch a good old old movie , ooh, bad drivers , uh bad laws , politics often , when i'm annoyed , you know i really don't get annoyed that much i just let it go , it's not worth the pain and problems they could cause, if i can't straighten out a problem let it go , go somewhere else , ooh, always my bridge partner but that's different uh as far as anything else i don't really argue with people, i i don't argue i don't like confrontation, my parents of course very very much so, um, i had great parents , uh , my mother uh my parents met at tuskegee, which is a black college and they always want me to go to a black college but of course i didn't wanna do that <laughter> uh i went to illinois so, they're a very positive role model for me there's certain things that i don't do today because of them i don't drink i don't curse i don't look down on people who do but i don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things um , i love to drive i love to travel, and my dad used to always take us some place every weekend he was off we'd go somewhere 'cause we were in chicago indiana michigan some place in the area we'd go up to michigan and pick fruit or we got all our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana that kinda thing, uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer so my dad used to love to drive and i love to drive also , mm, that's a hard one , i've had a lot of great experiences, uh, i think the best one was uh we went for my anniversary we went to europe we went to paris and uh , we rode the orient express, we went from we didn't go all the way to istanbul we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris uh , that was probably the best experience i've ever had in my life i i've never really cared for europe because there's so much here in the united stated to do and so much in america and i had been to alaska and hawaii but we said we'd do something different and, we'd always wanted to go on the orient express and we did that expensive but phenomenal trip, gotta do it once it's a once trip not once in a lifetime just once, not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger , but um, there are a lot of things we should've probably done we didn't do i wish i had gone to chicago <chica> we would always go to chicago on thanksgiving but i think we should've gone more than just on thanksgiving, my parents come here at around christmas time but i think we should've uh, done a lot more when it comes to that , yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us , i think that people <peop> most people, oh yes very definitely , ooh , that's a good question ten or twenty years ago , i would've said um, don't take things too seriously but don't be too relaxed over 'em either, sometimes you can uh take things for granted never take anything for granted , nothing's promised , oh heaven forbid , <laughter> no i have not <laughter>, no no , no , very very easy i really have no problem with that once in awhile if i uh am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due then i get kind of uh anxious a little bit , i don't like to be late uh i don't like to make mistakes so therefore i i do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that i have everything right , tired , i don't get irritable i think i just uh, lethargic maybe a little <litt> just a just a little bit , very good i was up late last night so i'm kinda tired now but i i usually have no problems sleeping , uh, and i get a good night's sleep , mhm, no i have not , um, no not at all i just came back off a christmas break <laughter> so i'm should be very relaxed now, ooh i have great kids , i have a son at u_s_c, and i have a son at u_c_l_a , and my daughter just got married , so i'm i'm proud of my i'm really proud of my kids , they're they're going to have a good life , oh yes, um i enjoyed it i still enjoy it , being a parent is forever <laughter> so , uh <sigh> let's see , taking care of someone else and getting started off to have a good life , i think that that's rewarding, making sure everything is covered , that needs to be covered with you kids whether it's their eating their sleeping their clothes they dress make sure they're content make sure they have no problems at school or home or uh that that they're safe, physically mentally spiritually everything, hmm, my best friend would say she has not changed since high school <laughter> uh, level-headed, but uh great sense of humor, relaxed i don't take things too seriously, ooh, i love the holidays i love christmas i love everything about it i love preparing the house for it i love baking cooking, especially baking i love experimenting with new recipes and so the last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here i felt fantastic, everything is is quiet i'm not at work i'm not stressed out in any way at all i have no projects due, that i have to think about anyway , so uh christmas time holiday time , really enjoyed recently well christmas of course we went to las vegas um, the twenty seventh of december that was fantastic <fantas> we only stayed for two days we had a really good time uh we saw a great show , we had some great food, we drove there we don't usually drive i don't like to drive a lot but we drove there and just took our time, so, it was good it was nice , okay , goodbye thanks for listening how's that one okay",1
481,"<synch>, yeah, i am, um good to moderate, los angeles, yeah i'm from, um, just a lot of different kinds of people and um eh i love the weather most of the time and um great creative scene i'm i'm really into music so, um it's a great scene for that, i i don't like driving <laughter> i don't know who does right, i it's just it's just such a drag and uh, getting from point a to point b is just a daily need and it doesn't get any easier, it's too many people, too many people <laughter>, <laughter>, i can't see your shoes, um, uh yeah when i can, uh when <whe> when i can afford to, um <sigh> just being somewhere else not having to drive usually most places have better public transportation, um just i love <lo> i'm you know i'm a culture junkie i like experiencing different types of cultures so, that's, , um well you know i haven't been to that many places i've been to like mexico and italy, it it's uh, you know i wanna go to more places i wanna go to japan, so that'll be that'll be interesting it's usually just with my family, um it's my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just uh, yeah we go to italy we spent two weeks there though that was cool, yeah, um, living next to the best gelato shop in italy, in we <w> we were in florence <f> when we were in florence spent uh spent a week in florence, that was great, very very good uh culture there as well, art, studied uh film and digital media, 'cause uh i make music and i wanted to learn how to make music videos, so it's something i'm trying to get into, uh yeah yeah i mean, i need to get a camera though that's the thing, uh but um i mainly my main focus is music i studied film but my focus is music, um yeah <y> sure, i've been playing music i've been playing guitar uh keyboard bass drums, for um for about twelve years now and uh i do uh production and songwriting i'm in a indie rock band, , um that's a great website i highly recommend it and it's uh it's mine so, check it out, uh international rockstar music producer, and uh, filmmaker, director, probably outgoing, um just just feel like it's a way to get the best <be> most out of life, uh just talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's uh, kinda just goes with the territory <caritor> territory <laughter>, <laughter> yeah, um i uh do meditation, and, uh it's not really hard 'cause it's fun, and it it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time, which uh you know that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time 'cause normally when i'm relaxing i'm i'm tuning out, i'm focusing on something else but, um to be able to combine those sensations was uh yeah i've been doing that for about, uh three months now so, yeah it is, um, almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there's things that should be said, that i that i don't, um just because, um you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily 'cause he didn't do anything to them, and uh i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a, awkward social situation but um, you know i make do, um, <makes sound with mouth>, probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh, we had a falling out we're not gonna be in a band together i mean we're still friends so, at least there's that mm but um it was just basically about, creative control of the project and how we're gonna prioritize it in in our lives and uh, you know we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so, that was the end of that, um <sigh>, i felt, good that it was definitive that it was you know a choice had been made on both parties, uh also regretful that you know he didn't, feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so, the fact that he wasn't really in it kinda pissed me off, um but, i got over it, um and you know i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me you know even honored, so, you know, i'm uh i'ma keep going, thank you, um <sigh>, hmm, i don't know, i don't really i don't really have any regrets like that, at the moment i can't really think of any, um, <deep breath>, um, when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i didn't think it would mean anything at the time, but i did it, i i regret it, but um, you know, you know life happens you make some mistakes, selfishness, um being young and thinking it wouldn't matter, um, you know, thinking, you know you only live once and, you know for eh it was probably for the best ultimately 'cause you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so, that was <wa> that was years ago but, uh she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so, i regret it, <deep breath>, um, shit geez um, i guess uh whether to go to college or not 'cause uh i uh i had some projects going in l_a that i didn't really wanna, shut off uh i i had a band going we had a manager, um we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over, and um, i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and, it it was a difficult decision but, i'm glad i did 'cause i met a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that, you know we work on stuff together and all that so, it's good, i agree it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter>, um, maybe i wish i could forget, getting spanked in the parking lot when i was four by a danish babysitter, uh, you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget it so, i have a pretty vivid picture of it and, i'm i'm i'd be happier if it wasn't there, it's positive, they're supportive um they give me a hard time sometimes because, they, don't think that, i keep things in perspective in terms of how i'm gonna support myself even though i do it's just um, you know i have a, a more long range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and, the creative projects that i make so, yeah, there's a bit of tension there, just 'cause, you know they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but, i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer, but they're sweet people, how do i cope with them, uh i you know they're lovely people at their core you know, um, cope with them 'cause i love them, i just uh, you know at times i'll just uh, go off on my own for a while, and eh you know take a breather whatever, you know everyone makes you mad sometimes so, <deep breath>, challenging, um <sigh> i just i try and it doesn't work, um sometimes i have to take medication for it i have to take ambien, something like that, um, yeah it's difficult <di>, i'm someone who sleeps in late, so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something, um, i get nauseous sometimes i'll throw up in the morning, um, yeah i've had jobs where i'd wake up and, you know vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible, it does suck um it's kinda, something i'm worried about you know i i kinda need to get some part time work while i'm, not, you know, getting a steady pay flow for my music production so, yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh>, got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how, just, not feeling good getting nervous when, you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or, just something i that doesn't sit, well with me like, being in a, you know a a rushed and, you know stressful work environment it just um, unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to, to give a shit frankly, like, and you know i i try to psych myself into giving a shit and, it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and you know my body doesn't want that in the morning it just, i feel like my body rejects things and, yeah, okay, i've been feeling okay, very uh very reflective very contemplative, you know there's gonna be some changes and there's gonna be, some new people in my life some new people uh in my band, um, you know i'm gonna try to push myself, but try to stay grounded at the same time 'cause you know i expect more from myself, it's just pissing me off when my get my you know i basically feel like i'm, shitting all over myself my body's shitting on me anyway just by, being so um, shitty <laughter> yeah, no, yes, um i was diagnosed um, about uh, twelve years ago i haven't been in therapy since, um, they gave me zoloft and i didn't like it, it made me feel worse than i do in the shittiest moments i was telling you about it it uh it made me feel numb, um i don't wanna feel numb, i wanna feel everything even if it sucks, being forced to, it was a private school, they thought i was acting up thought i was a uppity kid i think i was just being a kid so, yes, i do, um well i haven't been in, in twelve years, but i do think that it might be helpful for me in the future, i thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there <laughter>, um well yeah i uh, uh i i kinda wanna go back to therapy it might help, might help me, find some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist i need maybe it's a life coach i have no idea but, i'll be seeking help soon, um, yesterday, i was watching a movie with my girlfriend, and i looked over at her we smiled at each other and it was it was it was great, yeah, um, very honest, um, sometimes brutally so but i'm a good guy, i think that my friends all think i'm a good guy, probably funny, um, open-minded, um, i guess well it's what i'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline, and try to work through, my body rejecting shittiness, of the world, <laughter>, it gets better <sigh>, um, stay in shape it gets harder, the longer you wait, um, don't give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing, my music, you're welcome nice talking to you",7
397,"sure, i'm good but i caught a cold, morning <sniff>, l_a, <snort> born and raised born and raised, it's home <snort> food people culture, traffic, uh there's a lot of us <sigh>, too many of us probably, oh, <snort> i have in the past i haven't traveled lately, uh the destination i don't enjoy the traveling anymore at all i did when i was young but no longer <snort> it's the destination point, mm okay, <snort> uh in ninety two i went to spain, and my grandma my father's mother was born in spain i went back to trace her roots <snort>, and i spent a week in madrid a week in barcelona and a week in majorca, <sniff> had a great time, i enjoyed it, ooh, it was a an everyday thing people were friendly uh, finding out that some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting, <snort> uh i studied uh poly sci and uh sociology, uh <sigh>, well at the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do, no no, uh <sigh>, well i had my dream job for a while i was doing sports research for uh native american tribes, <snort> but uh yeah, i enjoyed it, but that's uh it's not as uh, as often as it was <clears throat>, mainly because of the uh, the sports bureaus that exist now that didn't exist when i started, i still when i do i still enjoy it, uh <sigh>, i'll be what <wh> what i'll be what suits me in any given situation, uh listen to music, uh i like oldies, jazz, mm soft music, uh i've learned to do it well i wasn't wasn't always that way but i've learned to do it well, by when by arguing i assume you mean words uh, with my youngest daughter it was about uh a year and a half ago, uh well it was it stemmed over an incident i didn't like what the, the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her she got, extremely defensive and rather than deal with it she became she became angry with me <snort>, i was mad, uh three girls, thirty eight thirty seven thirty one, uh three granddaughters, eleven fourteen eighteen so i haven't won an argument in a long time, but i adore all six of 'em, uh, well now i don't really consider myself a parent <snort> since mine are grown my baby is thirty one and you never lose that but i mean i'm not parenting at this point in my life, i'm enjoying my grandchildren, when i was a parent yeah it's a difficult challenge, is uh, getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand and don't understand, and not putting your your stuff in front of theirs, the hugs, well my dad was was physical uh in those days you know uh nobody called child services if you got hit, uh, uh my mother was very loving but my dad well you know he he'd raise his hand to you if he thought it would it would uh disappoint you <snort> i never did that, adored my mother <sigh> my dad uh was a hard guy, but i loved him, uh, i never felt abused by him but i mean, i the one thing i remember he said when you when you're capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house, that's my that's kinda the the basis of our relationship, my mother, my kids my grandkids, well i'm i'm one of i'm one of three <sigh> three sons, <clear throat> so i really didn't have any experience with females other than uh with my mother in terms of being you know related, and my grandma, and then when my first daughter was born it was like wow <snort> that was it i fell madly in love with her, changed my life, yeah well that's the way it happened, uh <sigh>, when my mother got sick i i wasn't <wa> i wasn't there for her the way i should've been, and i don't feel good <goo>, oh yeah you can always fix what you did in the end <snort>, i was just in a real bad situation, but that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there the way i shold've been, at least not in my mind, uh <sigh>, uh my second marriage probably she uh, she wanted to have uh children and i already had my children with my first wife, and uh, i i had i had told her initially that i did not wanna have children and you know i had three, uh that and i was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children <sniff> so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant, and our relationship changed and, i basically wouldn't relent and we ended up getting divorved, uh i i i don't know that i would've had children <chil> would've, would've had children with her but i, i wasn't very flexible in the process, what to be flexible, i don't know, sometimes i am sometimes i'm not, uh, that'd been pulling my uh, pulling my father out of off uh uh life support, i just kept going back to something he said to me when i was uh younger, that he would come back and haunt me and, if i you know if i let him lay there lay there and suffer, it took me a while to convince my other two brothers but that's what we did, something i could erase from my memory, uh being locked up for a while, i'd like to erase that from my memory <snort>, it's just, it's an everyday hell, where there's very little humanity, and uh, you even do some things that you're not proud of, i've never slept i've never slept a lot and i'm one of those people that if i wake up i have a hard time going back to sleep, so it's it's difficult <diffi> it's uh, i'm pretty much still the same, i don't change, so so i had friend <f> uh, things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the little incident with my granddaughter <granddaugh> uh my youngest daughter but i had a friend recently who was uh, runned over in a crosswalk and uh he's on, he's on life support so i haven't been feeling too good about that, it's it's affected me, it wasn't like he was jaywalking or anything he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the break so, and he's on uh life support at this point, mm no not really only consistent thing about me is i'm very inconsistent, uh no, no, but i've had moments where i felt i was i was depressed, okay i was talking when you were talking so i didn't hear the question, uh uh yesterday, had a conversation with my fourteen year-old granddaughter, i'm happy i have moments of happiness every day 'cause i i either speak to or, text with uh my daughters and granddaughters every day, even if, we're upset with one another, oh i have a lot of regrets, uh, i should've went to law school, that's that's kinda something i thought yeah began to think about more in my lifetime, i was accepted i just didn't i had other other things i thought i wanted to do <snort>, uh <sigh> uh i i played with uh wanting to be uh uh a kicker for football on a football team, had some tryouts things like that, but they didn't pan out, and as as that didn't pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer, so i just did other things, i don't think it'd make that much difference i probably wouldn't listen to myself <snort>, um about myself uh <hums>, uh, i could be uh, if i don't like you i could be very uh very difficult, if i don't like you, i'd very much like to change that, it has in the past yeah <snort>, well i have this theory that you could make me feel bad about myself only if i let you, and i'm not real big on letting <let> letting people do that to me uh although my first wife when, when she left me with the children <snort> she you know that it was my fault, and i wasn't sure that i believed that but i knew i was an ass, and and uh, but i probably believed it and not in its totality but in part <snort>, <sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judgemental uh uh i would listen to anybody, uh, whether i agree with you or disagree with you, uh, uh i've taught myself to uh, control anger that i that i have uh, and uh if if i've called you my friend or if i tell you i love you uh i mean it it's that's not something that i do uh, casually, <snort> uh oh okay well i i played eighteen holes of golf with a, with an old dear friend and we got caught up and, uh <sigh>, we four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner, met his new wife uh had a good time, a lot of a lot of memories came back, mm, <snort> uh well i like i like my my kids <ki> uh my grandkids i like that you know i like the hell out of them, i don't know if all kids are like that i i think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology but, but that's me mainly 'cause i don't, but if my grandkids are any any uh sampling of it i think they're good i think they're pretty good, raising my girls, basically by myself with the help of my mother, i think that's the uh most proud of, or, okay nice chatting with you, bye",5
423,"yes, i'm fine., los engles the larger los engles area, people, diversity, and, various entertainment and activities, around unstable weather, transport, and litter, i have not been travelling internationally, to see other places and how people live and culture, the last trip i went to was san diego, but.., from childhood or as an adult, to family vacation around baja and rosarito beach, yes, the reason why this memory comes to mind is because, this weekend is easter and we will usually go, to the east < east> east spring break, to rosarito baja, i have a bachelor's degree in communications science., because it's an open field, but it's not about.., communication interactive but performing art, telecommunications, entrepreneurship, no, i'm not really unemployed., um, i think owning my business is my dream my dream job to have my own company, um, i want to open something in the telecommunications area, as an enterprise, doing something online services online, i like doing things with my hands, so my next venture would, it would be to create all natural soy candles, something in this area, around a mixture, a mixture of shy and outgoing, because i have to watch people and crowds, and so i usually make a destiny when i, remain reserved or open, i hear like a meditation band or i take a walk, or go for a massage, fair, oh man <laughter> uh probably yesterday or this morning, um, in general, it is about the argument, i'm making myself clear, or i repeat myself twice, no, it usually gets the other person in trouble, mm, i redeemed a service from a mechanic who repaired my transmission, and i had a guarantee, and i wrote to the consumer affairs department, and the guy offered me a part of, the resolution agreement , and i decided to bring him to small claims court, to get a larger amount, and i wish i had, took the offer he gave me, in the middle of, dealing with the third party, which was the consumer affairs division, and therefore i took him to small claims court and i end up losing, the whole settlement and was offered only a very small part, so i wish i had, the higher, street taken as the lower street, i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things., the most difficult decision, i don't know, financially emotional, mm, emotional release of a past relationship, it's the hardest thing that i can do, i'm not gonna say the most difficult thing, but it was a difficult thing., yes it was a relationship of seven years, but this person has moved on., so, they want me to be in their lives., in the hope that , when something goes wrong with my current relationship, we will always have something to fall back on., yeah, it's hard., around an event, something i could erase from my memory, um, i don't know, <laughter> there are a lot of events, that i only delete automatically from my memory, but whatever comes to mind, right, um, probably the death of a relative, to be alone and misinformed, because i didn't know they were so sick, and i didn't know they were numbered around their days, and i would have had more opportunity,, spending and making time with them, better a better connection in the last days, um, it's fair to midland, mm, my immediate i am very close, but distanced not very close, my mother, yeah, she encouraged me,, continue my training, time and again on my, hobbies hope for goals and dreams, she always encourages me,, always stay away and, out there looking for a better opportunity, and she encourages me,, don't be afraid to, explore other ventures, light <laughter> light <laughter>, i felt good., um, a little stressed out, but i'm trying to do this., i'm leaving the stressful environment, um, in the past, about three years ago, um, because i had problems in my learning environment, and i felt <f> i felt, emotionally attacked, yes, i had a problem with a professor who, was just very, i don't know any other personality., and, he almost chased me down the catwalk at school., i felt, i felt like i was in a dishonest environment., i felt, as i wanted you to know change his class and get into another class, but i had no choice but to stay there, and deal with his meanness for the whole semester, i think by finding p t s d, they tried to link depression., no, financial, i'm not capable and i haven't found a consultant who's ready and committed., to work with me and help me with my problems, i think a lot of consultants listen to me., and then they laugh at me, and then they tell me, the opposite of what is, what i'm telling them, mhm, mm, the last time i felt really happy, i really don't know., that's a good question., um, just done what i just want to relax, i was just relaxing and, i don't know, <laughter>, i don't have any best friends, my best qualities that i'm working hard i'm reliable, i'm an excellent friend., um, i'm energized., and i'm a go getter, things i wish i could change myself, likely to be less sensitive, don't take things so personally, and, learn how to help yourself before helping others, no, i have no regrets in my life., if i could have done it differently ten years ago, i probably would have done it., concentrated and studied more, and less, to come out of the house and, hanging with friends, that i have a college education, and i myself am sufficient, and, i can pay my own bills <laughter>, and, i'm alive., goodbye.",0
456,"<synch>, yes, i'm well thank you, uh boston massachusetts, yes, i moved to l_a about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one, uh quite often at least a couple times a year, um god i love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that that i love, uh to pursue acting and writing, mm it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um, the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and, it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality, <sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path, uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so, sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year round and, uh i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is, what i don't like uh well i miss my family <fam> i miss that there's not <no> i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here, mhm, mm i can't see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and, mm eh florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here, oh just to have an adventure do something fun or if i'm going home it means i'm gonna see my family, <clears throat>, um one of my trips mm god well, i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco i have family and friends there, always super super fun uh in god in college i with my college boyfriend, when i was in boston i we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to l_a and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one, uh in general, just, <clears throat> mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and, i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport, we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was, it was big monumental, i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever, mhm, studied communications um got a lots of every lot of different uh writing writing styles i eventually graduated with a a concentration in public relations and a english minor, writing to pursue writing, writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first, hard, very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to, i would say outgoing on in general, i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise, calming calming area and just, just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to, to come back to a calm neutral place, i am, getting better no <laughter> um i'm okay <ok> i'm, good at controlling my temper, 'cause i don't usually, have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it, yes, no, <laughter> hmm mm, argued with someone um, god, i guess it was a friend, a friend a girlfriend it, it wasn't it was about, uh our, our each separate perspectives on a, a certain situation between us that, were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is, this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly, <sigh> hmm mm, i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that, it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it, mm, i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've, made the outcome much less, chaotic, hmm, uh i guess that would be, hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and, kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for, sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and, i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that, you know you're not always gonna, feel great <gr> every decision's not always gonna be easy and feel good, yes, i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just, yeah, mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be, in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that, my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i'm completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and, i could not ask for a better family they're, the ideal, my parents for sure they're just wonderful people that just taught by example and, i feel like i'm a good mix of both of them, it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've, come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy, <sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm, in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and, uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and, just um sweat more just feel, feel um just a little off, i've been feeling pretty good lately, mm not really just, trying to be more focused <clears throat>, get things done, um just trying to focus on what i wanna do career-wise and really, stop wasting time or you know, just procrastinating and and get things done and being inspired going and seeing, you know being around people that are doing what i wanna do and just carrying it over to my own life, no, no, uh oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and, that's why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome i'm always happy when i see her, probably as um very, funny, humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say joking always a little, wise-ass in my personality but um they would describe me as always uh unconditional there for them and just, they know they know that i'm there if they need them always, my drive being more driven and just getting things done, mm i guess it would be well a recent, a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh, yeah sort of just, uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and, even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel, like i'm let allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so, i'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible, yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts, don't second-guess yourself, <sigh> <clears throat> um great listener, constant sense of humor, uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all, just people from just all ages race gender, whatever i just i crave diversity and love to just you know i just i i i'm people person, and i um, i start every day with a blank slate, i um i did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience very inspiring, probably coming out to l_a on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what i wanna do, thank you, goodbye",6

where it gets out of hand i think kids these days are to some extent much wilder than i was and, and generations before me and just able to do and say and lack of respect and you just know, education wise it's just i think it's just hard times for kids and the way they act uh it's, it's ridiculous to me., um, i definitely like to see sport uh i like to play i like to travel i like to skate, um, i

um, many things i regret, i regret, many choices in my life, uh, yeah, one.., i'm actually.., let a lady go in my life years ago that i thought was my soul mate and, we had a big fight and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that this break i started with someone else and i told her i'm going my way and she's going her way i think that this is a big deal., a bad decision a very bad decision, yeah totally i think i'd have a step back and really just about the situation a little more instead of uh, be so excited and move forward, i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get so clouded, uh mm i, i need to think a little more when i'm excited, i don't know, just, experience and time, when you know how to make up for your mistakes, and and.., be better over, different decisions after you have made the mistakes, to <sigh>, think a little harder about situations <situatio> uh about situations and things and the decisions <dec> decisions that you uh, think much longer and harder before you make it and i think the result would be a little different today, um, my grandmother was always one around a positive influence uh she's a big black woman uh with an

outbursts, things like that, um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend, and she actually she has kids i don't, and for some reason she thought, or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and, she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things, um i don't think i've ever made her feel that, i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it, um, well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because, when she was talking to me she was very upset and, i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her, but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling, match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and, maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument, um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation, i felt that maybe i could've just let her, let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly, um instead of yelling at her too, oh wow um, that's a tough one i think um, gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years, um, although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was, kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and, i kinda felt by ending the relationship um, i would've wasted those last seven years of my life, it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did, because then i went on to meet um, my husband, thank you, um well about i would say, maybe, fifteen years ago i was, hanging out with a couple of friends at a, club, and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place, and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it, but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them, and, back at their house um, one of the guys, actually pulled me into a room and, tried, i i got scared i yelled, he tried to choke me and i thought, i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me, but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left, so, it could've been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind, it was, um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother, um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older, and we get along pretty well, um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now we're actually closer i think than ever, and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents, um my dad, still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes <laughter> which annoys me, but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship, yeah, um <sigh> i usually wake up, a few times throughout the night, um, so, i think it's rare for me to sleep, uh the whole night through ever, um and i do feel a little, like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely, um, so yeah it's kinda hard to get a good night's sleep, um i don't know it, i have a hard time falling asleep, and then sometimes i have bad dreams or, i need to get up to use the restroom um, but yeah it, i don't remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once, um, emotionally good, um i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice, um, physically i feel good i haven't been to the gym in a while so that kinda, makes me feel, bad um 'cause i like working out, um but health wise i'm good <laughter>, no, no, um, it was, last <la> this past weekend i actually went out of town with my husband, we didn't go very far we went to santa barbara but, we really enjoyed ourselves um we went wine tasting and, went to the beach and just had a really good time, um she would probably describe me as a good caring person, um, patient, very shy, um, she'd probably say too that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors 'cause i'm always doing things for other people, um so yeah that's how i think she would describe me, i wish i was more outgoing, um, i wish that, i, what else, definitely more outgoing, um, so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i am very shy, um i also wish that i could have more patience than i do <laughter> sometimes i'm very short of patience, and um i wish i could, find a better job so i could do more traveling, um, yes i actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree, and i really wish that i could've, you know taken care of it a lot sooner than i did, um, and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend, um i would've told myself to stay focused on school that, going out and hanging out and just, you know, and going to parties um was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first, um i'm proud that after so many years of not being in school i was able to, go to u_c_l_a and get my degree, um, yeah that would be my proudest achievement, okay, thank you, bye",3
383,"yeah i'm totally fine it be confidential or not you know my words <wo> my words are everybody's get wild <laughter>, i'm doing pretty good hanging out nice weather um i just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you <laughter> the the digitial you that i'm saying uh i don't know it's yeah it's funny, um <tisk> because i just always thought that uh the conveying of emotions or feelings uh, be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non human entity such as yourself, yeah, i, i think you see what i mean <laughter> i'm from um born and raised in los angeles venice area mar vista specifically um, that's where i'm from, um well, there's a lot more that i don't like but what i do like is, that public transportation is coming up uh, that the idea of, certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent you know topic very, thought upon and i feel, that los angeles' deep culture is um why i stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to, there's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand <laughter> yeah, um, well the, the human mentality here is um, is very very hectic very chaotic, you know a lot due to, the vehicle the car the freeway, and this idea that we're on, a grind you know this, yeah it's it's a very, it's it's very hectic um, atmosphere human atmosphere that, is not very conducive for a, supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing, yeah, well i can't see your shoes <laughter> but um i love to travel i do love hiking i do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides uh <laughter> i do love to travel yeah, um, from my travels it's not like, well i do enjoy a lot of things about travel but, it's more like what do i, it's it's just more like i i enjoy not being, uh trapped in the city with all these uh, made up ties and restraints i enjoy, traveling because, i get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux image, you know man <ma> man made image that it is here, so i love traveling because i get to get out of this and see the world as it is, thanks <laughter>, would you, <laughter> okay <laughter> um, well i um, kind of recently last year went to, los banos central california area, and although it wasn't that far from l_a it was completely different energy um there was no phones, there was no wifi there's no t_v, there was um, there was sanity there was a relative sanity, in the sense that um, people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and, outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chilling i was working at a hot spring resort, and i just got to breath and hike, and farm and do a lot of carpentry, yeah, um not hard you don't you don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't, um, i guess uh kind of what i described about the city i just wanted to uh, get out of here and, kind of, kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal yeah, um well, currently i'm studying um, currently i'm studying physical therapy i'm about to become a licensed massage therapist but before that yeah kind of cool but before that i was going to, , um for music composition so i was just writing scores for, films animations dance productions theater productions, stuff like that yeah it was it was cool it was fun trippy, very trippy um but it was cool but i had to leave that because, tuition hikes, up to you know going up to like fifty thousand a year for like a four year b_f_a, is uh not not the deal not trying to, trap myself with these uh chains of federal loans, so yeah, hey that's not a good word sucks <laughter>, um dream job hm, my dream job would be, anything <exhale> that i can do to, alleviate these uh metropolitan, like cities from, the nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to, incite dream back within, the modern human world, and with you know physical therapy and artistic expression, i've got some, great ideas <laughter> yeah, um, i guess more outgoing i just like i just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah, <laughter> i thought that was really funny um what i do to relax is uh, just kind of breath it out chill maybe make a smoothie or some tea and i go bike riding write yeah, hmm, pretty good i guess i haven't, yelled in a long time, um, well it wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to state my opinion, and have it be understood and i like the person that i'm conversing with to say their, opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was, uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes, things are not ready to be written, yeah so yesterday, hm, guilty, that's tough i haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt, what about you what's something you feel guilty about, okay, mm, i don't really wish i could erase anything from my memory 'cause then that would just, be like, i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if, something just got erased you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah, hmm, um maybe the time, , um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just, kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend, and it didn't turn out, you know not all, nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little, uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and, i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up, yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh, maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully, the hardest decision, huh, hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a b_f_a, yeah that could've been the hardest, um, it's just uh i don't, i mean of course money money is the motto money's a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support <s> not a fan of support that, but um, yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um, but another reason why i, decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was, also because um art institute you know um that's a, that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician, being taught by a musician, to, make music, and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know, and it's just um, yeah it's just not, quite as artistic as i thought, art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not not from out there you know so yeah, hm, if i, if i um, it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i, remember to breathe and go through my mantras or, remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um, but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah, um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice, a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice, pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know mm you know medical herbs uh, like chamomile and cannabis and, just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju <laughter>, mm, mm i i guess not if i can't think of something no, i've been feeling, kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a grey line but it's a nice grey it's a really nice hue, um some people wouldn't like this but i really like that and it's uh, it's stable, yeah it's it's comfortable yeah, no no i haven't, not by a certified um medical professional no but no i haven't <laughter>, um, yeah i mean i just think like the whole, you know like you said p_t_s_d depression and you know other you know mental instabilities i think, everybody is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybody's angry, i think everybody's shy everybody's social all at the same time you know it's just, different days different you know variants different floats different boats you know different, waves different swells um so yeah i think, i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know all that but just on different variants different floats, really happy, um, i i mean i feel really happy a lot, uh and i feel really sad a lot but really happy was uh i guess, maybe this morning when i just biking over here just enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze, biking, yeah it is <laughter>, um well i have a lot of best friends and they describe me all all pretty differently but underlying that same idea, that maybe i'm just uh maybe in a nutshell just kind of aquarius i guess, well i'm twenty one so twenty years ago <laughter> i would've told myself to keep being a baby uh stay young, and don't lose sight you know don't stop listening keep letting things happen don't make them happen, be, be a beautiful baby that's what i would've told myself or yeah be a beautiful baby, mm, um, well i guess recently what has been shown to me uh through me by me, is um my ability to work, with others and i'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint i've been uh collaborating a lot with, artists working on a lot of different um mediums mixed media projects and, i'm really comfortable with it and with other peoples and melting our ideas together, yeah, mm, that's a weird question like, um, like that's trying to make me single out, the you know one moment that i today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that i'm not capable of fulfilling today so i think the proudest moment of my life is right now chiling hanging with you, yeah thank you, mm, it's interesting um my immediate family is uh, mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in south asia, just kind of backpacking around uh younger sis she's really chill she kind of does music too and we just hang out, we're really cool mom mama i'm really chill with love her to death, uh she gets me and dad, uh he, he doesn't get me but, i love the art that he makes he he does crazy painting and i kind of get him through that but uh, uh yeah there needs to be more communication which is being worked upon, hm, cool yeah thanks for wondering about my thoughts, goodbye, so i guess i, push this guy, oh so i could still talk to you, or i could push this button, but this is kind of fun <laughter>, and you can laught you should laugh one more time <laughter> can you do other things than laugh",7
396,"yes, all right., virginity, i wanted to live somewhere else than virginia with a little more variety, um, once a year maybe, it's.., it's much slower and there's much less to do, i wanted to live somewhere else and, a nicer warmer climate and around somewhere where there is much more to do and, there's a lot more going on., it was really easy for me because i wanted something <someth> it was very different and i wanted something different, i like.., i like to do all the things, like the museums i like, the beaches and the mountains and all, hiking and doing all the free things, people don't appreciate what they have here, they just want to come here and take something with them, but they don't want to give anything back., bad drivers, not as much as i'd like., travel whenever i can, but usually it can not afford that much, mm, well, i like to take, i like taking pictures and i like it, new places to explore my wife and i like to see, flora and fauna and migration and, monuments and only different areas to see, um, we're good., we went to central california, where we would like to go., more international places, but that takes a while to afford, so we went more local, so we went to, um, we went to hurst castle and to see the sea lions around, the, elephant seals and things like that, um, i guess our uh, i guess our palm springs trip to our anniversary we have the, eh we have the tram and a nice hotel and jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall, i guess somewhere in between, english and film, well, i.., they told me i had to go to college and i hadn't quite decided what to do., chose something i would like to do for the time, all right., i wish i had, not put under pressure, so i had more time to find out what i wanted, i might have done something else like physiotherapy, but, uh no i've been teaching <t> gymnastics that's something i do earlier, um, i didn't have to starve, and, i did it, i'm not as bad as i thought it would be i went for it and it ended up kind of fun, dream is to have money and not have to work for it, overall pretty good, um, i don't remember what, but it would probably have been, a few weeks ago with my wife, well, everyone i ever really upset and, scream, i always wish i wouldn't, but sometimes when someone doesn't listen, it makes me crazy, you know if i'm just.., to say something over and over and they just don't listen, it makes me really angry, to <sigh>, i don't know, i spend a lot of time with them, but, i don't know what the most difficult thing is, because if i decide to go with something, you know it's usually for good reason., well, i think i feel guilty about moving to california and leaving my family in virginity, i mean,, i know i shouldn't, but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like it, living there, you know, i'm the one who moved away, so it's like i left her., well, i mean,, i don't miss virginia, but i miss her, so i guess a little hard, i have a good relationship with my wife and my parents in law with my mother and sister., no problems, everyone gets along well, mm very close, um, i mean something <anyth> anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise, it depends on how much exercise i have, a lot of exercise it's pretty easy if i don't, um, just like now a little bit, slow and out of it, but, not really.., otherwise too different, um, i just walked down 'cause my.., my mother in law dies and we spent three days., in the hospital and we will go back after this, so not much time to, sleep, mm, just.., just slower <sl> only slower and, tired and, that's all., no, no, um, usually only if i have <havi>, having a fun day either alone or with my wife is pretty easy for me to just be outside and, and uh and hiking or exercising it's not hard for me, i'm not sure if.., maybe, of a width not exceeding 3 mm, eccentric, but in a good way, i hope, no, um, to, be careful with your, to be careful with your, work to make sure you don't get hurt and to, i don't know, just your normal, your normal type of, uh older type of wisdom <sigh>, mm not much to say really everyone recognizes things when they get older that they want they had when they were younger, i wish i could get rid of my back injury so i could get back in shape like i used to, that's.., the biggest thing at the moment, um, not much to say, just hurt my back at work and, i just like to come by because it's, you know you're keeping me from doing a lot of things that are everything., to do well as i used to uh gymnastics and trampoline and used to be much more active or exercise and now i can only exercise a little because it hurts too much, um, likely to be the same as during the, during the day go on a hike or in a park with my wife and, uh, enjoy pictures and wildlife and movement and then, in the night, you know, we're watching a movie or going dancing or, just something like that, um, very proud of the, i mean, i came here without knowing anyone., i was at a point where i could stay in virginia and feel comfortable and, you know, in the end, i did something that i regretted, but i came out and i always thought that was a good decision., mm, my parents my grandparents my wife were most people in my life, see you.",5
344,"yes, i'm okay , i'm from uh los angeles california originally , yes, sunshine uh the weather's great , it's about it, smog pollution crime, um , certain things like that yeah , i did in one point in my life i was in the military so don't do hardly a lot of traveling no more , seeing different sights different people i think it's more the people and, being around different types a city and the people <peop> see meeting different new people , uh <sigh> i traveled to uh , new york one time and uh, it was quite different big city , different people , uh that's about it , eighteen , uh yes i was <laughter> , uh no i did a lot of combat training but no combat , mm disciplined more uh, more motivated, uh you get a lot of things done more <laughter> even when you don't wanna do 'em, you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that that that you really needed to get done but you didn't wanna do it but it got done, uh like uh , you had to uh do a lot of cleaning, uh you had to wake up pretty early you had to do a lot of p_t you had to uh stay up to like two three o'clock in the morning you didn't wake back up until four or five, yes <y> uh <laughter> to a certain point yes , after the military i joined the national guard and i did uh fifteen sixteen years in there uh i was, uh excuse me ma'am i didn't hear that <th> quite hear that, uh what made me decide to do that , uh, just the motivation just you know really wanted a career see if i could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit yeah , thank you , it wasn't that easy , uh i mean i'm sorry it was easy it didn't bother me too much to go back to civilian life , yeah it didn't bother me at all i just <ju> i adjusted pretty well , uh <sigh> history basically a lot um , yeah just basically history , uh no i'm not i'm uh disabled, oh no it's okay it's okay we can all i can heal i can get better hopefully i will , yes i try to keep a , excuse me ma'am, i guess i don't , my dream job would probably be, working with others working with young people working with kids seeing that they get the uh the right and proper uh uh education that's you know, that's due to them so they can be productive in the life of society as we live in today , yeah , excuse me , <sigh>, what i think about 'em i think uh they should uh be more, more uh <sigh> i mean they should they should <sh> participate <tapicitate> more in what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to uh, really achieve something, within their lives to give them the mm to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life, 'cause a lot of 'em don't get it, <sigh> when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing , uh <sigh>, it really eeks me i mean really bothers me and when people, talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just giving me the the run-around <laughter> won't you just be straight up with me, that can be very frustrating, uh and really when people do really i'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <laughter> that really botthers me too , uh spray painting on the wall , uh, just, throwing garbage anywhere and not picking it up, uh not really being uh you know not really being , hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean , yeah , <sigh> what i do when i'm annoyed uh i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you, and it's something that's not really me, but uh i'm learning to, really let go of it a lot you know just you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like i'm not in control i can't control it, yeah i have only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good, it's not good for me, oh my temper can be controlled i can control it pretty well , uh , i i don't know i think it probably was my sister, and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and i have mine don't tell me what to do, yeah , we real close i can get along with 'em we're real close i have no problems with them , yeah very good , uh , this morning <laughter> , yeah i wake up pretty you know i i first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so, when my spirit's in connection, with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world i i feel pretty good , yes , uh <sigh> up and down you know, up because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life than just not doing anything at all, and then other times where you wanna get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's road blocks in the way but uh, i'm learning how to uh overcome those road blocks as well, uh , well for instance uh looking to go to school and i was having problems uh getting enrolled in school, i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and uh to do it so i'm like okay it's well it's gonna get done <laughter>, yeah , uh can you repeat that one more time ma'am , uh yes i have , see i had to be, uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh, i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry , and i have to take , excuse me ma'am , uh it's not hard at all 'cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh, and then go from there and find out what's what's really bothering you , it's very seldom , uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh getting that type of sleep, would be would be great , because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so , <sigh>, i i think it is and i don't know what it's triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone 'cause i'm a veteran , at the uh v_a about the situation now, about the p_t_s_d basically right now , excuse me ma'am , uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression, uh i noticed all this in me and uh, i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help , and that's that's basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasn't wrong with it something wasn't right with me , and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it , and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah , somewhat yes it is somewhat , 'cause i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist , well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell 'em my situation and we usually will go over the problem, and uh, i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit , yeah , it's a good thing, excuse me ma'am, no, no not really , my best friend , uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh , think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it, so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me, yeah they see something in me they wish that they had , excuse me ma'am, uh can you be a little bit more specific , oh okay , uh books crossword puzzles, uh walking, that's about it , i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because , this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on , because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future , yeah , <sharp inhale>, uh <sigh> more education uh , being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing, like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago , uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life , uh <sigh>, yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> i mean consistently motivate me, to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot, and uh, he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done , excuse me ma'am , uh <sigh>, that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated, and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished, if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it, oh wow huh , oh really and you know what i really enjoyed, was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life, and school was one of 'em uh , and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me , yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing

art major but, i didn't understand why i was in math classes among other classes and i thought i was wasting my time so i decided i really didn't wanna do that, so i moved back to l_a, i don't really have a dream job uh i, would like to be self-employed though, right now i'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer but i'm not really sure, uh around new people i'm very reserved

and self-hypnosis, i try, it, depends on, what <wha> how i'm feeling, or how upset i am or how calm i'm trying to be, if i'm really upset it's a lot harder for me to calm down and, bring myself down through meditation or through self-hypnosis, but, yeah, um, i'm alright at it sometimes i lose it, i yell when i lose my temper and, i have put holes in walls, not, yet <sigh>, last night me and my

ticket a week in advance and i didn't want to do it last night, that situation last night, i wish i had not blown up or, gotten as raged enraged as i can over the situation 'cause it escalated, my little sister i'm very close with, um she's fifteen years old she's about to turn sixteen in a few days, uh i would do anything for her she is the world to me my mom um we fight we push each other's

got out of hand i guess and, my mom was trying to get me help and i didn't want the help so i kept uh escaping to different places and running away and not, wanting to be in the places so i finally agreed to go to utah and try and get sober, , um, he's my best friend my entire life ever since i can remember and we we grew up together, he used to use drugs with me and he's been sober for more than a year now, almost impossible, um i either have to have no sleep the night before to get a few hours, or i i just i don't i don't sleep well i'm against taking pills, and i stopped smoking marijuana and so now i just i don't sleep, or haven't been, the past few weeks, yeah it's not fun, i lay in bed until i finally fall asleep in the early morning, or i watch t_v until late at night or

place the entire weekend so, i've been happy, um, <deep breath> <sigh>, i don't, i'm not as irritable, no, but, yes, i was probably, i was i believe i was twelve the first time i was diagnosed i've been diagnosed multiple times though, um, most recent time being less than a year ago, uh my mom sought help for me she saw that i was unhappy and she became worried, no, uh i stopped in on june first when i graduated my uh drug rehab program, in utah, of last year, i'm learned coping skills, so i'm able to, calm myself down when, i'm angry easier i i i know how to stay away from the my trigger points and getting away from staying away from being angry, or becoming depressed, it can be, if the person's willing to change, and wanting it, two days ago, it was because i was with my girlfriend we were having a moment, and so i was just overwhelmed by the happiness i guess, <laughter>, trustworthy, um, funny, shit i don't um, outgoing smart athletic he would um, yeah, i wish i wasn't i was so short fused i, wish i wasn't depressed i wish i didn't feel like i needed something to help me sleep, i wish i was just completely dependable on myself, um, when i was younger my father would uh, he once hit my dog in front of me 'cause he was mad at me, so he started hitting the dog and i don't that was probably the biggest thing i was little i remember just being sad, yeah, everyone has something they regret, <deep breath> <sigh> not to be so naive, hmm, uh, i went to hypnosis, i had a a, an appointment for hypnosis a few days ago, it was really relaxing really calming and i feel like it could help me, um one of my mom's colleagues, referred her to a, psychiatrist who's really good with a_d_h_d and patients like that, <laughter>, um, i'm athletic, um, i'm nice, i like to, i put other people before myself, most of the time i don't know if that's a negative quality or positive, i, i don't know, my ideal weekend i would either go, to a a few parties or i'll i'll hang out

i found., mm, mhm <laughter>, it depends on the situation if i'm dead when someone comes to me, looking for me to help them, i take control, but if i need help, it's anyway i work at asking for help so, it depends on the situation, mhm, i garden, and i paint, i'm very good at it., three days ago it was about communication, it was the lack of communication on the part of the other person., and, i needed them to communicate better so i could understand, they didn't communicate, so we fought., and uh has cleared it up <laughter>, i felt ignored., because this is an individual with whom i spend almost every minute of my day not being told what was going on in the person's head and then creating a situation, you know, i was kept away, i didn't like it., uh, i'd rather have <laughter>, mm, uh, probably the lack of time with my grandparents, growing up, it's just when they're gone, you're sorry you didn't miss the time with them., so, mm, uh one thing i really wish i could remember i was a, i was a professional athlete at once and, i had celebrated until four in the morning and then i had my event at ten in the morning., and uh, i was my captain and i embarrassed my whole team, and uh, this is one thing i really regret, i was a professional fighter, so.., yeah <sigh> like no party thought about other people but me, mhm, uh, i studied massage therapy and got my nursing degree, um, and much of it was just on job training, around very close, uh, because of my own injuries., i had just gone through the therapy process and believed in people and saw how it worked, and i decided to do that i also wanted to help people, yeah, that's good., oh, yeah., yes, i want to paint., that's all i want to do is just paint <laughter>, um, i have two sons and it's time for me, uh, to continue

reminds you so much., who you are, consistency, even if you are sick <laughter> are consistent, i don't suppose my children are right or wrong., i'll listen to her first., and then i make my decisions, and i'm not trying to come from an emotional, increased space, i think logically and i put myself in her place, before i do, we'll discuss how hard it is to communicate in my family., uh, because that's the only way we can get along is through communication., how to communicate, my family is pretty much separated, so my family and my relationship with my family, on the reservation is very tight, the rest of the family we are all fragmented and scattered around the southwest, so it is not very close to all, uh, i have too many to count., start with my uncle my uncle was like my father pulled me a good way, uh , uh he paid attention to me, he told me that he taught me hard work at a young age., um, he taught me to protect my family, too., and taught me glory, taught me love, he's a good man., i haven't slept good night in years, so i got broken sleep., uh dreams the dreams become too real, i get up and go to the toilet <laughter> and go back to sleep <laughter> i try <laughter>, um, uh, um, uh.., my years of struggle it just uh it caught up to me, , uh reserved, yeah, that's good., reserved and i'm trying to find things to distract my brain i'm thinking about different ways to do things, uh, mm, well, i got rid of t v about eight months ago, so i got rid of this distraction, so what i'm doing now is, i either paint, i garden, or cleaning house washing dishes, you know, or go out and go, that's another thing to do, a lot to go out these days, uh anxiety <anxi> anxiety <sigh> uh for a lot of worries, but it's good that i have techniques to calm down now., um, nothing new, out of the normal, yes, uh three years before <sigh> around there three <sigh>, insomnia, it was about, two years ago around there, two years ago i was released from therapy, oh, the therapist released me., um, well, i had noticed that i'm still dealing with pictures and emotions, but what i do now is that i practice really hard, taking care of myself and coming to these places, the things that, hit me to get scared or excited or angry, i've learned how to, to work out of it and to realize that it is not real, it's not real., it's just the emotion it's not really., so these are the things i say to myself like little mantras, and that really helped me a lot from the therapy because it taught me that these emotions and pictures are really not real., and yes, so therapy has helped a lot, i mean, it's just it's changed my world, yes, at the same time as the p t s d, three years ago, in my dreams when i dream , last night, i only dreamed of fighting and then in preparation fighting fighters and that was another thing to build fear dreaming about preparing fighting fighters, and then step before thousands of people and then i always end up fighting in my dreams, so it's always mm what scares me in all my dreams that i would have made the train and ended the fight and i didn't, and so it builds fear and stress in me and then i tend to act in my sleep, yeah, that's good., as if it were real, as if i were there, how i smell taste feel everything i was there, yeah, that's good., this morning., <laughter> go here, talk to my girlfriend, this mm,

mm starts a new art project yesterday, it was nice., mm, well, i know., we were in santa barbara and we found some stones and yes some old rocks that someone had made a pile and just threw a dump of old rocks out of the way and i walked through the heap of rocks and, i found this old rock that was in the middle., and i took it home and now i'm making a work of art on it and for me it was as if this thing was totally forgotten, was just looked at as a rock, and now it might be sitting on my grand table, you know, it's just for me that's really cool i like that, mm, start something, the, i'm so bad at it, that i don't think there's no way that i can be good at it and that i suddenly, to be better at where i don't even have to think about it, just so good at it that i could just touch and

uh took about a couple of years, but uh, i feel like i'm pretty used to it now, uh i like that uh it doesn't snow it's warm weather, and there's lots do to with a lot of beaches, uh the traffic, and the cost of living is pretty high, i've never been outside of the u_s but uh i would love to at some point, uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance, i like uh listening to music uh doing crossword puzzles, reading and hanging out with friends on weekends, uh very good, hmm, uh, i don't think it was argument maybe <may> maybe a difference of opinion so it was more like a debate, but uh it was pretty pretty tame, uh i think it was a, debate over sports, over a basketball <ba> a basketball game, and uh, i was talking on facebook with somebody about it, but i think it's good to, uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh, it's natural to you know, not always agree on things, so, i think talking <ta> talking about is healthy <hea> is healthy, i have a very good relationship with my family um i get along with all of my family members and extended you know cousins and aunts and uncles, so uh, there's no one that i i've ever had any rifts with, hmm, with my family, hmm, i probably could've been more disciplined growing up, and, more, uh, more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kinda thing, but for the most part uh i had a i had a good childhood and uh there's not much i would change about it, hmm, probably leaving my comfort zone in uh south carolina moving out here that was pretty, hard but at the same time it was, uh exciting, so it was it was a bittersweet feeling, um, a lot of excitement mixed with uh some anxiety but it uh, it went away pretty quickly, sure, not doing better in school uh when i was in high school, uh definitely i could've been a a <ss> um more diligent worker and i could've uh applied myself a little bit better, hmm, i've always had a strong support <s> uh family support system, and uh parents and uh siblings, so, that's definitely a positive thing, hmm, an event, uh, probably going back to school i wish i would've uh, wish i would've done better in school so if i could take something back from my past it would be, uh scholastically <sch> scholastically related, it's pretty easy, when i don't sleep well um, i tend to be, kinda lackadaisical and uh, just tired throughout the day kinda groggy, uh no everything's pretty much uh the way it usually is with me, i've been feeling pretty good, uh no i have not, uh no i haven't, last time i felt really happy um, i made a lot of money uh a few weeks ago and uh i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so, i'm still kinda have the lingering effects from that happiness, yeah, uh, when i, when i have money i tend to be a lot uh, more even-tempered, not even-tempered but i tend to feel better about things, and more optimistic, and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game, and to have uh, have sources of income, uh, i think i'm creative, and i think i'm a good listener, hmm, to be as disciplined and focused as possible, because once you're out of your, parents' homes and out of their lives you have to, depend on yourself and the better the better you do in school and the better you are um, uh as far as discipline's concerned the more pleasurable <pleasur> pleasurable your life will be and, a lot eh uh, your life will be a lot easier, hmm, let's see here, i wish i was more, disciplined, but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better, at that, it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older um i'm out of my twenties now so, i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here, hmm, um, some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but, uh i kinda take insults in stride and um sometimes i welcome, constructive criticism, 'cause some some things are wrong with you that you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited and it's coming from the right place, i think it could be an invaluable uh tool you know listening to what to what other people, have to say that might be negative, hmm, uh probably optimistic and, um, outgoing optimistic and, uh helpful, my ideal weekend uh, i would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with with three or four friends, you know packed in the car and just uh lots of disposable income, and um you know good weather, uh i haven't been to vegas in probably five years but, um, i've gone to casinos with my brother and that's pretty fun sometimes, uh, i'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm uh a lot more disciplined, um, i read a lot, uh, i do crosswords, and i think i've, i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want, hmm, i'm not a big fan of high taxes, um, but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and uh, i guess i take it in stride though, uh, i had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun, it was a documentary, a sport <s> a sports, sure, goodbye",0
434,"<synch>, yes i am, i'm doing very good today, i'm originally from chicago illinois, moved out here when i was three, yes, i never go back, family issues, it depends on what you're into, if you're into, um the fast life and hollywood it doesn't compare at all, um if you're into the cold weather then you would rather be out there i i like the sun, i'll, my mom and my dad split up, <laughter> it's okay, i have no idea i was only three when i moved out here, i like the sunshine, i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter, fall and and and the summer i like the beaches i like hollywood, i like that the lakers are here and, and, <laughter> i love um the people is it's a different variety i think, l_a is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to l_a for a better opportunity so that's what i like about l_a, oh gang violence, <laughter>, no not really i've traveled one time to arizona and one time to stockton california, and another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now mainly because of finances, i studied alcohol and drug counseling, i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that that's what i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions so, um, that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and, i just went into it, to do it just just to see what it was, and, i finished school and, did a intership and got hired and so, i believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life, i'm not working right now i actually moved away and, i had to <deep breath>, i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um, in order to make that move, but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling, well, it can be it can be very difficult at times because, um, i have a felony uh and and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly, and but the regular dopes i can, and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours, so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um, yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience, and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard, <laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility, um, or or as an author, you know that depends <de>, that depends on on, on people mainly i mainly, adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky then i'm gonna be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not shy i'm just giving 'em their space and allowing them to decide when they wanna open up, but if people open up right away then i open up right away, <laughter>, i i mainly listen to music or, i watch youtube, write poetry, um, or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i can't, so <laughter> that's, and another thing i do is, i eat ice cream <laughter>, controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that, last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was, um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred, i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and, i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and, you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it, i just believe that, and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um, heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that, well i was just telling you about um, it was it was my mother's husband and, to tell you the truth um, i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped, you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure, as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um, that, i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so, i should've just left, i should've just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um, yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months, so, yeah those six nine months i can't get back, yes, well my brother's in prison um i haven't seem him in twenty years he's been there twenty years my sister moved to chicago, thirteen years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother, and um, my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and, how that's gonna turn out for me i've just you know i have small family and, i have family in chicago but, i don't, mess around with that side of the family just just because um, of what i seen, and heard so i just don't want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance, someone who's been a positive influence <inf>, influence in my life i would say, , taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me <m> me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else, and, taught taught me how, how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until, that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um, and of course um he's, he was the one that encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he got, twenty seven years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and he <h> the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that i'll never forget, feel guilty about, my grandfather, um passed away in two thousand four, and, at that time i was just getting out of prison, um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he, told me in so many words that he wasn't gonna be around for that much longer, but i didn't get it 'cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that, plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying, but, when he died, i figured out that he was telling me, that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then, and, i feel, i think about it all the time, something i can erase from my memory, huh, would be the day, my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like, that's one memory i just i can just go without, replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there, i felt conflicting feelings, because on one hand, on one hand my brother was protecting me, from getting beat, and on the other hand he was hitting my mom, so, was kinda in the middle, uh most nights i don't, i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably <prob> i'm more than likely up at seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep, it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well, i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um, if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep, how i been feeling lately, i just been feeling like, that, things are about to start going better for me, um making some better decisions, um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people, that can um open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes, i don't care if i get, five interviews i'm i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission, and, and um i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people, um know about me because i've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before, um, the that the public is exposed to what um i've been gathering, my behavior i'm more mellow, um i laugh more more humorous, i let a lot of things go that i used to just, let tick me off, and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and, mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally, and psychologically eh, and the um, acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me, so, i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um, my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm, you know um, back then i just tolerated myself now i um, actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you, to feel the same way, no no i haven't, no, last time i felt happy was last night 'cause the lakers won the basketball game, <laughter>, yeah, my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth, because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it, and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it, and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people, um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them, like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and, yes that's why he calls me the truth <laughter>, um, i wish i would've never, well obviously i wish i would've never went to prison um, i wish, that i could change, well, um my economic status my employment status, and um, my teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of, stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be, um, confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up, every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they looking at my teeth i wonder if they're looking at my teeth i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says, are they looking at my teeth so i would really, change that and i would change my physical um size i think i would like to be, at least thirty five pounds heavier but i'm working on it, twenty years ago which would make me eighteen, i would've at that time i was a big time um high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i would've given myself the opportunity, was to stay away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i, could've been playing for the lakers last night but, hey, i'm most proud of the fact that, you know what i'm most proud of my mom, really, really, um, she graduated from school, she had a full-time job she had a full-time job um she would wake up at, five in the morning, go to work, get off her job at three thirty go straight to the college leave the college at nine o'clock at night she does this five days a week, and still had the strength to maintain um she was on the dean's list and the president's list so doing all of this, you know when they say , that older people can't do things i i just think that dispels that rumor um, and she recently got her um license as a evangelist in the church so, i'm just real proud of that and um, her life has been affecting people, in a in a positive way so yeah my mom, <laughter> okay thank you, goodbye",2
384,"yes, i'm doing fine, indiana, yes, uh i don't know maybe ten years ago, never, uh just don't like the cold weather, l_a has beautiful weather and, activities all the time, new life, uh reasonably easy, the good weather the ocean, and there's always something to do, hm uh, the traffic, sometimes, seeing new places uh and visiting new people, well a couple years ago i went to the catalina islands for my birthday, i was i spent the whole day uh on the catalina islands, i took a boat there, uh, hopping on the airplane and leaving indiana for good, okay, sleeping, uh, being a filmmaker, because it's one job i haven't had yet, not too hard, shy, hm, because of my past, um i, just have trouble making new friends and, just let <l> trusting people, okay, uh watch t_v or go to the movies, i really don't have a temper, when i was sixteen my stepfather, uh because of uh nightmares i was having, i was just having nightmares about my childhood, about my involving my biological father, so far i have no idea if they are or not, uh go for a walk or drive, uh maybe a few days ago, uh just walked around the block a few times, pushing people away, uh i guess, try to trust them a little bit more, let them in my life little bit more, well that'd be easy that'd be the first half of my life, it'd be easier to start a new life if i can't remember my old one <laughter>, uh, really i mm all my decisions is not that hard i just try to avoid stress and everything so i don't really have hard decisions, uh, well every time i push someone away i wish i handled all those situations differently, uh well uh whenever someone gets too involved <volve> involved in my life, i always say or do something to make them want to stay away from me, um this, depending on the type of person they are, uh i really don't have a relationship with any of my family i know i have a sister someplace in vegas, a half of a brother in indiana, uh my stepfather's in arizona, other than that i have no relationship with any of them, um, we really don't talk, so it's kind of hard to talk about them <laughter>, edgar cayce, well he died way before i was born and i only know him from like books and documentaries, uh really not that easy um, i, usually <use> usually take me like a few hours to get to finally get to sleep once i lay down in my bed, uh well basically i try to lay down i have stressful <s> racing or stressful thoughts, a few times i might even try to listen to music for one hour just to see if it calms me down, stressed out, and just yeah just basically a little stressed out, well i've been feeling a little bit lately <leet> a little bit upset and, just wish my life was different, uh well i wish i had friends and loved ones and all of that and i wish i had an actual relationship and everything but i don't, well lately i live <li> i move we moved a bunch of stuff <st>, things out my stress <st> life stressful things like, bills and what not, and just try to keep, uh, to make sure there's the least amount of stress in my life by, just, removing just different things out my life and trying to incorporate new things, yes, i i guess we're number sixteen, nightmares, uh stopped a while back because it was getting too stressful, well basically i just, i just pushed like i got rid of them out my life because i didn't feel like they was really listening to me or anything, and uh, yeah so i just didn't feel too much beneficial help from them so i've been looking for alternative means, uh well just basically like music and, going forcing myself to go to like different social related events, yes, depressed, mm just but basically just depressed uh keeping myself locked in, not talking to anyone, uh, uh i guess a few days ago, okay well basically, i feel that the best way to keep people in my life is, having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars, and user names and everything and, i just have some uh fun, going into virtual worlds with these avatars, and talking to people that way, so they don't know who i really am, they don't even know my real name, okay well my ideal weekend uh let me see, is uh if i'm not working that weekend i will get up maybe go to like starbucks or a mcdonalds, get online while eating or drinking something, maybe play a online multiplayer game for a little while, and then later on in the day maybe go to a movie, uh whatever's playing then, uh go someplace else relax watch some t_v, um, and maybe put on a d_v_d movie and, um, or i might spend the day i the whole day driving to someplace i haven't been before, or it's been a long time since i've been, just try to spend the day in that area, and just, yeah so that's the weekend, my life, i just regret how my life turned out i wish i wish i had a more normal stable life, uh, let me see ten twenty years ago, i was especially, uh, i would just tell myself to keep a journal or something <s> uh or, to basically, tell myself, how my life will turn out now, so that way hopefully the other me will make different choices, uh my mind, well i wish i wish i was a bit healthier, i wish i looked a little bit better i wish my eyesight was, a lot better, and i wish i had a bunch of people in my life that i could call friends, um, i'm a freaking genius, i could, uh everything that i'm good at i learned self taught, so basically i can't get a career in that type of stuff unless i go to school for it, but, it's hard to, it's basically easier if i teach myself than like take some type of a class to do it, and everything 'cause, yeah basically <bay> yeah just basically, the fact i'm a freaking genius okay, thank you, have a good day",15
336,"hello, sure, good a little tired, indianapolis indiana , uh i'm a singer, i like singing , um diversity my girlfriend's uh, from taiwan so it's dealing with different cultures , the traffic, the uh, crazy people, it's um , seems hard to get anything really accomplished, <laughter>, it took me about six months just to figure out the directions, twenty eight years ago, a long time, haven't been there in about eight or ten years, well, uh i don't like my brothers so i don't want to hang around them, i started my girlfriend uh we did about uh just went back got back from orlando and uh she likes to travel so, meeting new people seeing new places uh helps me to get out of l_a and get a different perspective, uh i just did the avatar seminar which is like a, raise your consciousness and um cleaned out the crap in your head , <laughter>, um, yeah i feel better uh been having a lot of psychic attack and, it's uh i'm psychic so it's very hard to deal with it , <laughter>, um, well um, there's more to life than what you see so um, a lot of things are in other dimensions and other places so have to deal with not only the emotions but people uh direct energy at you, um, well have to do a lot of clearing and grounding and, stay true to yourself, i am both, well i'm introverted because i like to spend time by myself, and i'm extroverted 'cause i like to meet new people uh used to be totally an introvert , watch movies watch t_v read uh do crosswords i'm a singer sing, write music i'm writing a novel, um it's sort of like the matrix, um well i wrote the first twenty pages pretty quick, so um, uh now i'm expanding it, i get inspiration uh it was actually a dream and then i wrote down the dream and now it's becoming uh i could probably turn it into a movie, <laughter>, yeah, uh when people don't respect me that's the number one, no i just that my brothers they don't respect me they don't really, um, you know i want to love my family and but i don't want to hang around my brothers so it's a conflict, exactly, pretty good i only get mad about once a year, um my girlfriend about two or three months ago, she was wanting me to do something and i said no <yawn> and, i don't know, yeah, she's my girlfriend i know her for about a year now, pretty close, um, one time i, was singing and, , and i was singing to an audience and that was great, um, well i'm looking into ways to expand my consciousness so that i can have more money and more abundance in my life, so i can uh, have my own house and uh live in my own creative space , <sniffle>, uh singing i'm a singer so let's see like unforgettable so uh that's what i like to do, no, no, no, oh that's the hard part i uh i don't , i don't know maybe it's because when i was, uh a kid my brothers beat me up and, i don't feel totally rested in myself or in my life so, uh, i feel like uh <sniffle>, i don't feel totally safe, yeah, um, a little irritable, but i have been sleeping better since i met my girlfriend so it's not totally bad, my what, behavior what, i don't know, um well i feel more positive i did the seminar and uh, so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain <sniffle> and be more positive about life, um, well did a lot of exercises to uh, reduce my stress and lot of my stress comes from uh judging myself and other people , yeah you could say that, <laughter>, uh, well, <sniffle> mm, mm, i don't know it's hard, <yawn> hard to deal with sometimes i mean sometimes a lot much too critical for my own good, uh <sniffle> , well, watching t_v gets up but, <yawn> uh lately i just been feeling like i need to, um, have less judgement and more fun , uh well i did that seminar, um, it was about a week ago i think , uh well i went to that seminar i got there i was able to, take off work and <yawn> <sniffle> be in a different environment 'cause my job is stressful and <sniffle>, my life is stressful so, uh <sniffle> i was able to take a break which is great, uh i'd say i'm outgoing fun smart, uh, but i mean in l_a people in l_a they don't want to most of them don't want to spend time with you, i don't know if that's because of me or l_a, <laughter>, uh, that i spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward, avoid it yeah, watching t_v or going to see movies or <sniffle> trying not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem, uh well a little bit i haven't paid my bills a lot i still owe money <sniffle> so um, it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy <proph> prophecy , uh stop criticizing and, start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen , uh my girlfriend's been really helpful, <yawn> well she's funny and <sniffle> she loves me and cares about <abo> about me and , uh, <laughter> yeah, um singer and i'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and, uh, i'm a good listener , uh well i've written about four or five books i uh, my voice i think would be number one 'cause when i started i

305,"i'm fine., i'm originally from california, uh born in glendale, i'm not so happy with that., just unemployed at the moment but uh, active in search of uh, uh do what i'm supposed to do uh there's some uh, some prospects there, but hopefully i'll learn something today, yeah, that's good., well, i have one, it's a girlfriend, so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing, excuse me., we're pretty close., uh i met her last year and uh, we've been through something., disturbing times, but we begin to see a light at the end of the tunnel, uh, the disturbing times, uh, i would, let me see uh, all right., i got a d u i last year and lost my job, i'm a truck driver by trade so, such a way, threw me far away uh with a fourteen hundred dollars a week job uh and then go to nothing like plus losing my license somehow threw me away really, and i couldn't get around, i didn't really uh, i found everything i was interested in, so i started cooking., and we try to see which other route i can go as far as uh a kind of career and uh, so, i decide to go to the culinary field, but, you know, i still have to work, it's hard to find work with uh without going to school., and uh so, but i think i applied to ralphs today, so i hope i get the job i should actually have, so.., um, but i'm starting to see a light, as i said at the end of the tunnel, now a little bit gradually, my dream job would probably be a forest service, out in the wilderness yeah, i like being alone, excuse me., all right., you know, i have a lot for animals i'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like it, i don't like people too much, uh so being out and uh i've always enjoyed being out, that's how i'm a truck driver i've traveled the world, i don't like being in a warehouse or an office., outdoor kind of guy so, one of my trips would be uh, i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the lower island uh there that they built this bridge, uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh, i was there to work., uh for a very white oh uh a very white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus, so it was interesting that many people on this island didn't really see many americans, because that was also one of the islands we bombed., so there was a lot of negativity, but i've got quite a good idea, you know, outlook uh on life uh especially during the times you know i, i enjoyed it that you know., through all the travel and meeting new people and to eat you know different around different foods and uh it was a good experience for me, all the experience was pretty good for me you know, just traveling around with circuses and uh, you know it was great., uh, likely, a few of the things i like about l a, there's not much i like about l a but, i like hollywood, i like the film industry., the uh huge uh, um, different people you know differently uh, different ethnicities of uh people here you know uh, i enjoy talking to some people who know many foreigners i like to see where they came from and what it looks like there., the traffic is horrible, you know, transport < slaughter>, uh ignorance uh, be disrespectful uh disrespectful or whatever you know other people disrespecting you or other people, um, that's it., dishonesty, excuse me., uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i drive the bus a lot so uh, you know, or i, when i ride my bike, uh, people tend to drive me almost over, so if i don't pay attention to the traffic all the time, uh you know i find myself sometimes, you know you have to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of having the right to go or something like that., yeah big time, what do i do if i'm angry?, um, i'm probably sitting there, sitting there, airing, you know, i speak my opinion, even if i'm often myself, you know exactly how you know assholes or whatever you are., now you know, i carry stones in my back pocket, so i can know it's happening so much where i'm just i'm just surprised about what people do sometimes you know that you almost know about everything you know, i'll probably almost run over probably on a daily basis, and if i don't watch, i'd be in the shit stream., it's hard to deal with people who are particularly trying not to respond because there are consequences for your reactions., it was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest., i'm pretty honest with, i am open and honest about everything and everything, and uh, what it was about uh just she lied to me to uh told me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something and that and this aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie, so i just, you know that didn't like it at all., excuse me., um, i'm trying to miss the word for it., just that i don't know now if i could believe everything she's saying now, so it was uh, i felt hurt you know, uh, you know that here we're in a relationship for a little and good, that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is being honest, um, i don't like that i said i'm not holding back and i'm pretty honest in everything and everything i do or say so, you know and if you lie about something good, you always have to cover up., more lies with the lies you've already told and i just, you don't see anyone you know, so somehow it took a lot of me to trust her now, or you know whatever i am, you know, it's true it's not you know, so it's somehow hurt our relationship, there's nothing i can do about it., uh fun i, how to go to the beach uh, i love shooting darts, but i haven't done it in a while i love to paint uh i get in watercolor painting, and i'm pretty gifted about it and around, uh i want to try some other media and uh let's see here i love fishing, i haven't been gone in a long time., and uh, i like driving a truck, you know, it's my job, you know, i was a really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities, but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like stars i'll see if i'm looking around, pick some of them., astronomy uh stars up there and around, i'm a pretty easy guy to go, so shoot pool around, sunshine only, which i like, uh most memorable experiences around, good or bad, uh, the most memorable experiences, probably., play with lions and tigers uh, to wrestle a baby elephant in a mud puddle, uh, i'm just enjoying myself., i know, not, i don't have much family as it is, uh, at least here in the states, i'm not from central america., but i'm not close to i've got uh, three brothers a sister, and i'm probably not really close to any of my siblings, i'm talking to a brother, uh, a little.., my other youngest brother you know he just i would rather not know that i'm talking to him, but it's you know, only i'm trying to keep it on a professional basis my sister i'm not talking to at all my other brother among me, i haven't spoken to him in years, so i'm just near my mother, uh, my niece., a few of my nephews and that's it., i've done everything i can to avoid it, um, to avoid them, uh yeah, i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask for them i know, i'm talking to my mother pretty bit of my brother a little bit, but i just don't mention these topics or when they're being raised i usually say that you know it's on them and i really don't want to deal with them so, it's been hard lately, it was probably hard for the last uh, goes to one year, you know that i.., depends on my thinking process at the time i said i was looking for work., so just.., wonder why you know i'm not gonna be called i just mean i have racing thoughts, so , or i'm getting depressed you know because i or i'm worried about things you know that really i don't control, so, i don't know., lately i just slept a little too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to sleeping only four to five hours per night, but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired, lately i've probably spent the last few months, um, tired <laughter>, i know., sometimes when i don't sleep well, i just stay with the same things that bothered me so you know that i'm more of a guy you know, i love working., um, and if i'm not, it's just a little too much time for me to spend in my own head, and so, you know., i there i either when i'm busy or i do what i know you're in what job i kind of know you get it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me, and uh, so i can remember that you're either working or thinking at home and then thinking about knowing that i don't have to worry., you know about money, you know, bills are paid and i can just focus on other things, either you know, do the things i like, or, maybe spend a little more time with my girlfriend or something like that, how do i do something?, how can i deal with them?, um, i just.., don't try to think about it, it's not about whether you can handle it or not., i just do it's uh, i'm more of a guy who just, you know, it may take a moment for, to the, saying that i'm done with something, but you know, it's when i don't have control over it, there's nothing i can really do, the only thing i can do is control what i do and that's actively looking for work to go active on uh interviews, i'm talking to others about work so i can somehow know that i'm going back to.., back to the basics you know that i just don't allow a lot of things to bother me, it bothers me but i'm not trying to keep it bothering me, when what got me in trouble, my mood swings i mean, um, yes money i mean you know my past i have a past so uh the kind of tends to uh, i don't know if i'm hired, so i have to deal with different employers who, uh say uh crime friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i'm trying to tell you i've been teaching on uh, on uh how to interview, how to uh, how to answer some of the questions you know, come pretty a little and uh, i'm kind of thinking about it, but i have to keep pretending that this isn't the one that, who i want to be more like this or you know, i've done, uh, i did it., i have done my time so to say, but i took the time you know the last time i took only a lot of time and, and try to uh work on, the problems that have bothered me so much, you know what's positive, i've been thinking about my g e d differences many classes around uh uh going to school, i didn't go to school., and uh, anything that would somehow change my old ways and uh and try to move on to more productive activities, excuse me., i still haven't heard you., the, the people are deceptive, can you repeat that once again, all right., i was diagnosed with bipolarism., um, it's hard if you don't know., i'm not medication, so i mean, i used to take medication, but, um.., again i try to live from life uh i try to live life according to the conditions of life and i just know,, i know that the medical institutions always want to label something and, and what i don't like about it is that they're just experimenting with pills, you know, i was probably on every imaginable pill there is and around, you know, some of them were too strong or some of them were not strong enough and, so i just try to deal with things uh, it's just my life skills you know i don't want i don't want to work with drugs i know certain drugs work for as three to four months six months and then they go well here i'll try you on this and or i'll try you on that and it's just an ongoing process and i'll probably go for about the last two years, for about three years, i said that you know what that is, and.., whether it's different than if i'd be on top drugs for it, i don't think so you know it's still the same stuff that i'm still getting the same problems and i'm still, uh get the same fear as if i was on medication for it or not so i just, and i'll deal with it you know, sometimes it's not good, you know that i get very irritated with people i don't like people, i don't like crowds, i don't know how disgusting people like huge empty rest, um, but i'm getting a person you know it's not that personality, but i think people can see me and just say that you're not messing with this guy or you know.., but still you know, i like driving public transport quite a bit and around, you know you have a lot of disgusting people on it, sometimes i have to get off the bus., that's how i deal with people because i know there are consequences if i didn't deal with them like that., so i just let it go., i'd rather take the time to leave the bus and wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad, had a problem before i quit, uh, i don't know if i knew i had a problem before i found out i knew other people., um, i have a lot of ups and downs, so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me that you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that around, many remarks were like oh, that's what's wrong, you know that was what was wrong with you, we want you to have found that years ago, i don't think the drugs really work, but what i do, i think, um, as you know, just getting older., type of uh, you know it works, you know it, i'm so in contact with life, excuse me., uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while, um, recently, and it helps a lot what you know just to erase my anger, uh my thoughts.., many people may not understand, but uh, a therapist is, i think the bigger thing is that i can just figure it out, whatever it is for me, whether it's uh., people you know uh, uh, other problems you know were whatever may be the case, i just think to talk about it and they are so good listeners and can somehow like, you know they're giving me the same advice you know i'm giving myself or whatever i'm giving to others., but it's always helpful to hear it from someone else who, will be a you know you know they're going to school for this, so you know, but it's good to have, yeah, that's good., well, i'm not going around like that anymore, i kind of miss that you know how i said uh, uh, i really miss it, but uh, it's just one of those things that you know i'm just acting so you know, uh after you know if i'll ever get a chance to go back to therapy i'll probably, to good monetary reasons and uh, you know, i don't have health insurance, there's a lot of things you want to know, but i can't tell you,, you know, money situation isn't so great right now so, how my friends describe me, um, they would probably describe me as uh, uh energetic uh outgoing person uh as soon as i get to know people, um, i laugh you know i laugh i laugh a lot, um, but.., they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh, uh, hidden person i don't reveal much you know,, and uh so, someone who had a positive influence in my life, someone who.., someone who had a positive influence in my life, uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i started with uh, with exotic animals he really was, you know, he was uh, uh german and um, they have not been taking place, i don't know what he saw in me, but, he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and.., showed a lot of trust in me and that in it also built trust in me, and uh, let me know that you know there's nothing i really can't achieve when i imagine it., you know, yeah, that's it., you're welcome., to <laughter>",7
397,"safe, i'm good, but i have a cold, tomorrow <sniff>, oj l 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1., <snort> born and raised born and raised, it is at home < snort> eating people culture, transport, there are many of us <sigh>, too many of us probably, oh, i haven't traveled in the past lately, uh the destination i enjoy traveling no longer at all i did when i was young but no longer < snort> it's the destination, all right., < snort> uh in ninety two i went to spain, and my grandmother my father's mother was born in spain i went back to pursue her roots < snort>, and i spent a week in madrid a week in barcelona and a week in majorca, <sniff> had a great time, i liked it., ooh, it was an everyday thing, people were friendly uh, find that some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting, <snort> uh i studied uh polysci and uh sociology, uh.., well at the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do, no, uh.., well, i had my dream job for a while i did sports research for uh native american tribes, yes, but yes., i liked it., but that's not so.., as often as it was <freezes the neck>, mainly because of the uh, the sports offices that exist now that didn't exist when i started, i'm still enjoying it, uh.., i'll be what i'll be what suits me in a particular situation, uh listen to music, i like oldies, jazz, mm soft music, i've learned to do it well, i haven't always been like this, but i've learned to do it well, if you argue, i suppose you mean words uh, with my youngest daughter it was about one and a half years ago, well, it was because of an incident that i didn't like what the, the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her that she, extremely defensive and instead of dealing with it, she became angry at me <snort>, i was crazy., uh three girls, thirty three thirty eight thirty seven thirty one, uh three granddaughters, 11, 14, 18, so i haven't won a fight in a long time., but i worship all six of them, uh, well, now i don't really think of myself as a parent < snort> since mine have grown my baby is one thirty and you never lose that but i mean i'm not upbringing at this point in my life, i enjoy my grandchildren, when i was a parent, yes, it's a difficult challenge, is uh, to come to their level and understand what they understand and don't understand, and do not put your things in front of them, the hugs, well, my dad was physical in those days when you know no one called children's services when you got hit., uh, my mother was very loving, but my father, you know he would raise his hand to you if he thought it would disappoint you., revenge my mother <sigh> my father uh was a tough guy, but i loved him, uh, i never felt abused by him, but i mean, i remember saying that if you're able to kick my ass, you can leave this house., that's mine, that's kind of the basis of our relationship, my mother, my children my big children, well, i'm one of three sons of mine., so i really didn't have any experience with women except uh with my mother in terms of knowing you're related, and my grandma, and when my first daughter was born, it was like wow < snort> that it was that i fell madly in love with, has changed my life, yeah, that's how it happened., uh.., when my mother got sick i wasn't there for her as i should have been, and i don't feel well <goo>, oh yeah, you can always fix what you did at the end <snort>, i was just in a really bad situation, but that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there as i did., at least not in my head, uh.., uh my second marriage probably she uh, she wanted to have uh kids and i already had my kids with my first wife, and uh, i had told her at first that i didn't want to have children and you know i had three, uh that and i was good with it and she hinted that she didn't want any children, so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant, and changed our relationship and, i wouldn't basically give in and we were finally divorced, i don't know that i would have had children., would have had children with her, but i, i wasn't very flexible., what should be flexible, i don't know., sometimes i'm sometimes i'm not, uh, that stopped me., pulling my father out of life support, i kept going back to something he said to me when i was younger., that he would come back and haunt me, and, when i know if i leave him there and suffer, it took me a while to convince my two other brothers, but that's what we did., something i could erase from my memory, to be locked up for a while., i want to delete this from my memory <snort>, it's just, it's a daily hell, where there is very little humanity, and uh, you even do some things you're not proud of, i've never slept, i've never slept much, and i'm one of those people when i wake up, i'm having a hard time falling asleep again., so it's difficult <diffi> it's uh, i'm pretty much the same, i'm not changing., so i had a friend <f> uh, things are good with the children and grandchildren except for the small incident with my granddaughter <granddaugh> uh my youngest daughter, but i recently had a friend who uh, run over on a crosswalk and he's on, he's on life support, so i didn't feel so good., it influenced me., it wasn't like he was yaywalking or anything he literally ran on the crosswalk, and the guy never took the break., and he's at this point on life support, mm not really just consistent thing about me i'm very inconsistent, uh no, no, but i had moments where i felt i was i was depressed, okay, i talked when you were talking, so i didn't hear the question., yesterday., had a conversation with my fourteen year old granddaughter, i'm happy to have moments of happiness every day because i'm either talking to you or, sms with my daughters and granddaughters every day, whether or not they are , we're mad at each other., oh, i have a lot of regret, uh, i should have studied law., that's kind of something i thought, yes, started thinking about more in my life, i was accepted i just didn't have other things i thought i wanted <snort>, uh <sigh> uh i played with uh wants to be uh a football kicker in a football team, had some tryouts things like that, but they have not whistled out, and since that didn't work out, i kind of lost my desire to become a lawyer., so i just did other things, i don't think it would make so much difference that i probably wouldn't listen to myself <snort>, around about me uh <hums>, uh, i could be uh, if i don't like you, i could be very difficult., if i don't like you, i'd like to change that., it has in the past yeah <snort>, well, i have this theory that you could only make me bad at me if i gave you, and i'm not really big on letting people do that to me, uh although my first wife, if, when she left me with the kids, you knew it was my fault., and i wasn't sure i believed that, but i knew i was an ass, and uh, but i probably believed it and not in its entirety, but in parts <snort>, <sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judging uh uh i'd listen to anyone, uh, whether i agree with you or disagree with you, uh, i taught myself., control anger that i've got, that i've got, uh, and if i called you my friend, or if i told you i loved you, then i'm serious that i'm not doing something i'm doing., incidental, <snort> uh oh okay well i played eighteen holes golf with a, with an old dear friend and we were caught and, uh.., we spent four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner, met his new wife uh had a good time, many memories came back, mm, i like my children, my grandchildren., i don't know if all children are like that, i think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology, but, but i'm mostly because i don't., but if my grandchildren are any samples of it, i think they're good, i think they're pretty good., raising my girls, basically alone with the help of my mother, i think this is the proudest, or, okay, nice chatting with you, see you.",5
481,", yeah, that's good., i'm, good to moderate, the angels, yes, i'm from, um, just a lot of different types of people and around anyway i love the weather most of the time and around great creative scene i'm really in the music so, it's a great scene for that., i don't like to drive <laughter> i don't know who's doing the right thing, it's just an urge and.., getting from point a to point b is just a daily need and it won't be easier, there's too many people., too many people <laughter>, < slaughter>, i can't see your shoes., um, yeah, if i can., if i can afford it, around <sigh> just somewhere else do not have to drive usually most places have better public transport, i just love <lo> i'm you know i'm a culture junkie i like to experience different kinds of cultures so, this is, , well, you know i wasn't in so many places i liked mexico and italy., it's.., you know, i want to go to more places, i want to go to japan, so this will be interesting, it's usually just with my family., it's my mom, sometimes my girlfriend, sometimes my brother and we.., yes we go to italy we spent two weeks there although that was cool, yeah, that's good., um, living next to the best gelato shop in italy, in we were in florence <f> when we spent in florence uh spent a week in florence, that was great., very very good uh culture there too, article no, studied film and digital media, because uh i make music and i wanted to learn how to make music videos, so it's something i want to interfere with., yes, yes, i mean, i need a camera, but that's the thing., uh but um i mainly my main focus is music i studied film, but my main focus is music, yeah, sure., i've played music, i've played guitar, uh keyboard bass drums, for about twelve years and uh i do uh production and songwriting i'm in an indie rock band, , this is a great site i highly recommend it and it's uh it's my so, check it out, uh international rockstar music producer, and uh, filmmakers, director, likely to start, just the feeling that it's a way to get the best out of life the most, i just talk to people, learn from them and let them learn about you and take care of you it's uh, way goes simply with the area < caritor> territory < laughter>, <laughter> yeah, to do me uh meditation, and, it's not really hard because it's fun., and it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time, the uh you know that this was a great revelation to me that you can relax and concentrate at the same time because usually when i relax i'm tuning out, i'm focusing on something else, but.., to be able to combine these sensations, uh yeah i did this for, uh three months now so, yes, it is., um, almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there are things that should be said, that i don't, just because, you know, it's like opening a can of worms, maybe one of your friends, for example, i have a problem with him, but they don't have a problem with him, necessarily because he didn't do anything to them., and i had to deal with that somehow in the past., uncomfortable social situation, but.., you know i can do it., um, <makes sounds with mouth>, probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh, we were freaking out, we're not gonna be in a band together, i mean, we're still friends, so.., at least there's this mm, but it was basically just about, creative control over the project and how we will prioritize it in our lives and uh, you know we weren't the same priorities, and i was very excited., that was the end, to <sigh>, i felt, good thing it was definitely that you know that a choice had been made on both parties, uh also regretting that you know that he doesn't, feel how i wanted him to feel about what was excited about the project so, the fact that he wasn't really in it somehow pissed me off, um, but.., i got over it., um, and you know, i've got some other people who are really excited to work with me, you know, even honored., so, you know, i'll keep going., thank you., to <sigh>, hmm, i don't know., i don't really have that kind of regret., right now, i can't really think of any, um, < deep breath>, um, when i was in high school, i cheated on my girlfriend, i didn't think it would mean anything at the time., but i did., i regret it, but.., you know, you know that life happens that you make some mistakes, selfishness, to be young and think it doesn't matter, um, you know, thinking, you know that you only live once and, you know for any time it was probably the best thing to end up because you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that with her so, that was years ago, but, she was a nice girl she didn't deserve., i regret it, < deep breath>, um, shit, man., i guess whether to go to college or not, because i had some projects that i didn't really want., shut down, i had a band where we had a manager., we played a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep doing that or go to school and start over., and, i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and start a new life there for four years and, it was a difficult decision, but, i'm glad i did it because i've met a lot of people i'm still very close to today., you know, we work together on things and stuff., it's good., i agree that it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter>, um, maybe i wish i could forget., spanking in the parking lot when i was four of a danish babysitter, uh, you know, on the abuse scale it's pretty low, but it was a bit humiliating and i don't forget it so, i have a pretty vivid picture of it and, i'd be happier if it wasn't there., it's positive., they sometimes support me because they give me a hard time., they, i don't think so., i'm keeping things up about how i'm going to support myself, even though i'm doing it, it's just.., you know i have a, a bigger picture than they do and i have confidence in myself and, the creative projects that i do so, yeah, that's good., there's a little tension., just because, you know they expect certain things from me, and i expect them too, but, i just have a different way of doing it than they might prefer, but they're cute people., how can i deal with them?, they know they're lovely people in their core., um, to deal with her because i love her, i was just.., you know sometimes i just uh, go off alone for a while, and you know whatever you know, you know everyone makes you crazy sometimes so, < deep breath>, challenging, i just try and it doesn't work., sometimes i have to take medication, but i have to take ambien., something like that, um, yes, it's difficult <di>, i'm someone who sleeps late, so i always get at least six or seven hours when i have to wake up early for something, um, i get angry sometimes i'll throw up in the morning, um, yes, i had jobs where i woke up and, you know, vomit while i brush my teeth, it's terrible., it's annoying, it's kind of, something i'm worried that you know i have to work a bit part time while i'm, not, you know, get a steady salary flow for my music production so, yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh>, i've got a few things i need to get over, i'm not really sure how, only, not feeling good to get nervous when, you know, there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or, just something i don't sit, good to me like, in a, they know one who hastened and, you know, stressful working environment it's just about, unless it's about something that matters to me, like music or the arts, it's just very hard,, to be honest,, for example , and you know i'm trying to make myself a psyche to give me shit., it makes me sick, you know, maybe i have a red bull or something and you know my body doesn't want that in the morning it just, i feel like my body rejects things and, yeah, that's good., all right., i felt good., very uh very reflective very contemplative, you know there will be some changes and it will, a few new people in my life a few new people uh in my band, um, you know i'll try to push myself, but try to stay grounded at the same time because you know i expect more from myself, it just bugs me when mine get my you know that i'm basically feeling like i'm, i shit on myself, my body shits on me anyway., i'm so.., son of a bitch, yeah, no, yes, i was diagnosed., of uh, twelve years ago, i was no longer in therapy., um, they gave me zoloft and i didn't like it, i felt worse than in the shitiest moments i told you about it. i felt numb., i don't want to feel deaf, i want to feel everything, even if it sucks., to be forced,, it was a private school., they thought i was going to perform and thought i was an upity kid, i think i was just a kid like that., yes, i know., well, i haven't been to, 12 years, but i think it might be helpful for me in the future, i thought you weren't a therapist, that's a typical therapist question., well, yeah, i.., i want to go back to therapy, it could help., could help me, find some solutions maybe it may not be a therapist i need maybe it's a life coach i have no idea, but, i'll be looking for help soon., um, yesterday, i was watching a movie with my girlfriend., and i looked at her we smiled at each other and it was it was great, yeah, that's good., um, very honest, um, sometimes brutally like that, but i'm a good guy, i think my friends think i'm a good guy, probably funny, um, opened, um, i think it's what i'm working on, trying to improve my discipline, and try to work through, my body refuses shit, of the world, < slaughter>, it gets better <sigh>, um, staying in shape will be more difficult, the longer you wait, um, don't give up doing your dreams what you do, my music, you are welcome to talk nice to you",7

uh you know i was sort of withdrawn and um, the it was sh i was not able to focus on my things so, i thought maybe i should go see a doctor and i ended up doing that, uh no, mm, i lost appetite i was not sleeping well and, i i had difficulty um concentrating you know and, focusing and, uh i was not getting uh my assignments done on time uh these <the> these were some of the problems, i been feeling good, but, uh, no i don't, i started doing yoga and uh you know i've been doing that for about a year and, that's uh and meditation and that's helped a lot, uh it's just that uh you know when i was diagnosed with uh depression i thought i shouldn't be taking any medication for it, and i was looking at uh uh other ways to get over the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and, uh you know i got influenced by them, uh it's a little difficult but uh of late i've been able to sleep uh within half an hour , there are days when it takes almost one two hours to uh go to sleep, are they what can you repeat that, uh no, i just uh you know uh, just switch off the light and uh you know keep tossing around and, uh, try to focus on things uh that makes me uh feel good, and this and that, um about <bout> three days ago, what am i proud of, uh i was in i i was among the top two percent in my m_b_a class and, um, and when i used to run my business i designed a product um, that was uh working really well, and uh i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful for my business, uh, my my, i'm thinking my friends would describe me as uh very friendly very easy to get along with , uh very focused, uh very intelligent , and a good cook, um, albert einstein, uh, i mean some <so> some of some of some of his theories um, you know it, obviously it involves <inv> it involves a lot of deep thinking and uh the the first few times i read about him about his uh, uh theories, uh i had difficulty in um um really understanding that, and uh that you know we it, i mean when's when there when there are things that i really try to understand and i i'm not able to, i and uh you know there are there are the type of people i admire, listen to other people, uh it's diverse um and i like the the entertainment industry , and uh, i like uh, yeah the fact that there are more women uh than men here, <laughter>, um, uh there are certain areas where only spanish <spa> uh where only spanish is spoken uh you know i would like uh for all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english , so that everybody can participate, um, in l_a, um, i mean like i, some of the things the political leaders uh do really makes me mad, uh uh sometimes i think they're wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing , and um, you know these <th> these guys don't get things done and you know i feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry, uh, yeah, i mean the first four years of uh, obama administration i'd i think it was wasted because, uh if the, if congress, had acted together, uh eh got things done then uh you know we would <wou>, mm maybe we could have uh you know uh made it much more difficult for china to catch up with us, and you know the fact that china's able to do things and get things done much faster, and these people still um you know uh argue and uh, you know find <fi> uh find faults with each other and not get things done, um you know they don't seem to realize that you know uh you know the clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done, um, i mean like you know uh <laughter>, one thing that comes to my mind is well you know i made a lot of money while uh you know once in los angeles uh, and, you know i thought it happened during christmas some ten years ago, and uh that that made me very happy, good music good food, uh, i mean the eh, a party with friends that i like, and uh, and, you know i also like cooking and i enjoy cooking with groups in groups, uh those are things that really put me in a good mood, um, i'm very clean, um, i listen to people, and i empathize, uh try to solve their problems, uh, and i'm

anything, oh i like the beach, i love all the restaurants, um, um the music scene just the general excitement oh and the parks and all that, yeah, um the traffic, the um, the maintenance on the streets all the pot holes, um, um, the pollution, well i studied a number of things at school um, i studied um, um at one point i was i i had majored in public relations journalism specialization in journalism, and i also studied um i was a pre law major, and so, i studied the law and then i also studied um, um, human um, human services courses, mhm, um mainly because i'm a people person, and i enjoy helping people, wow my dream job, hm, mm, my dream job, hm, i don't really have one right now, no i don't and i can't even see your shoes, um, um listen to music, watch horror movies i love <luh> i love horror flicks, um, and i have a fish tank too so i like to watch my fish, also like to play tennis when i can i haven't been able to play lately though because of physical problems, um, mm, it's just that um, i had injured uh my my my ankle because i have anemia <aneenia> and um, and i got dizzy one night and i fell on my ankle and on my leg and so i'm just waiting for that to really heal, but i'm planning to get back um into tennis it's one of the things i enjoy doing it really relaxes me, i really don't have a temper over the years i've learned how to do how to control that, probably would've been yesterday but there was no argument, and what was it about, nothing that i can recall <laughter>, something i feel guilty about, hm, there's nothing right now that i feel guilty about, mm, oh a situation that i wish i had handled differently, i really can't think of one right now, the hardest decision oh, um, the absolute hardest decision that i ever had to make, um, was when my uh i had twins twin twin twin boys they're grown now, i had twins, twin teen teenagers, and um i had lost my job and we were living in a motel, and, the rent for the motel was outrageous i couldn't no longer continue to pay the, um pay the type the type of money that they wanted so i had to briefly um, um, put my son under the in in foster care for for for a minute, that was the hardest decision that i had to make, , um a schizophrenic, and he had had, um he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hearing when he was four years old, um but, and then when he turned fourteen the schizophrenia came up, um so right now he he's in a supportive living environment he's twenty seven years old, um but he he he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now, i had problems in the past 'cause he didn't wanna take the medication you'd give him the medication and he'd hide it stick it in his pocket or whatever, so but he's come to terms with that and we've all have come to terms with that and he's doing he's doing pretty good, , um that son he's twenty <twen> he's twenty seven as i said 'cause he's a twin, um, um was living in texas with his wife, and um he got a promotion to um, , now he's in california too both are in california okay so, um, i feel very good about that yeah, uh, hm, well of grown children yes, <laughter> of grown children yes, no no no no no no no, no i take that back, not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger there were difficult times okay difficult periods and um, just it was a lot of good times too but yeah it was there were some difficult times, mm, well the mm the difficult times i really pretty much already alluded to and that was when um one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and um, and um, they were in, temporarily and, in in well one was in foster care and one was actually um in a institution 'cause of the um the um schizophrenia, um, so, think i lost track of the question <laughter>, the hardest thing about being a parent, at this point at this <the> at this point in my life there is is nothing hard about it, um, the best thing about being a parent, i don't know i guess it's just to see <cough>, something that you created um develop into a you know pretty decent human being you know a decent person, that's the best thing, oh a lot of ways, um well actually, i didn't have two parents i had a mother, and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him um, but the thing that i do, differently than what my mother did, um, she was a strong disciplinarian, um both verbally and physically, um, and, she at she had this tendency which she outgrew, she had this tendency to be very critical okay critical and um, um opinionated <laughter> and very religious, um, and sort of, sort of looked at people who were not and that was me um as if they, were living life wrong because they were not going to church or reading the bible and that kind of thing, what was the other part, of the question, i i i don't get a good night's sleep or i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is to it if i don't take medication i don't sleep i'll be up all night i'll, i will be up for days if i don't take medication, man irritable um, and tired <laughter>, well well, lately, you know just a little anxious really um, you know um i just recently um, made a move to a new apartment it's a lot of expenses and, new expenses and things like that you know and new furniture and new this and that that you have to get which um i've i managed to do all of that but, um the whole thing was kind of stressful, yes mhm, no not p_t_s_d, yes, um that was back in i think two thousand and four, um, because um my life had gotten so stressful, to the point where, it was either i had to do something or, or end something to tell you the truth yeah, um yes mhm, yeah i think it's useful um you know as a good sounding board, you know someone to throw, you know your concerns out and you know discuss things that may be bothering you or good things too yeah i think therapy with medication, um, since i've been going to therapy, um the changes, a lot of changes um, i've been more focused, more, hopeful, um, hm, it it's just been a good experience for me which is why i continue to go, really happy, well, i can feel really happy, um by some occurrence i can't think of anything right now just like that, and then, i go back to how i was feeling, so i can't really pinpoint anything really i mean, eh eh i mean if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time, that that makes me happy when things go right how about that, hm, mm something i did recently, that i really, something i did recently that i really enjoyed, mean really really enjoyed, recently, hm, i can't think of anything, i don't have a best friend, um my best qualities, are that, i'm a honest person, i genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt, um everyone in my book, is as they appear to be, until they prove prove it differently, um, i'm very generous, overly generous <laughter>, um, and i'm very i like to help other people, i mean help you know i'm on a personal level help people, you know with anything whatever their problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out, mhm, anything i regret, how so, there's only one thing i regret and that is that, um, after my twins became um became old enough to um, start going to um school the elementary school level um, i was taking some courses um as a pre law major, and um, at that time i was married to their father, who who turned out not to be a good, fit for me, and, because of the stresses involved with him, you know knowing that that was gonna end and i was gonna leave him, um, i dropped out of college, so that was my biggest regret, hm, stay in school no matter what, stay the course no matter what, that i'm a good person, i'm a good human being, that's all, okay, goodbye",10

474,", yes, i'm good, how are you?, uh i was born in hawaii, but i grew up in colorado, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., about seven <s> uh seven to eight years ago, i try to go back once a year <ye> once or twice a year, yeah, that's good., um, it's.., how is it comparable to l a around it's, it's different, it's not so busy, there are more uh things to do out in the mountains, my family <fam>, for work, yeah, i love it here, it took me about a year to feel really comfortable, but, um, once that came through this kind of hard year, it was pretty good out here i've had a good time, for the, love that i can go to the beach, i love that it's warm most of the time., i love that i've met a lot of people who love the arts as much as i do., traffic just like any other, um, yeah, that's good., yes, the traffic and, it's pretty much just traffic, earthquake, not as much as i want, it's just nice to go to a new place., experience something else, around i went to alaska a few years ago and that was really awesome, i have to go fishing in the ocean and i got seasick, that wasn't great, but uh, it was cool i saw a bear in real life a bear walked through a yard, it was really different than it was really cool, < slaughter>, english creative writing, i've always wanted to tell stories., it just made sense to work on writing in some way, yes, i am., to, have my own t v show where i write it and everyone looks at it every week and it's awesome, really hard, because there are a lot of people who have the same dream., yeah, that's good., more outgoing than shy, i like talking to people, i enjoy other people, go to the movies or, turn on music dance, pretty good, around <sigh> it was at work couple about a month ago <ag> about a month ago, um, i've got, angry with someone because i didn't think they gave me clear instructions, and when i tried to have a conversation about it, they got angry and then i got angry and, we got crazy, i felt like i wasn't being heard or heard and, i felt that we were not able to have a real dialogue., because we couldn't have a dialogue, i felt like no one was listening to me., total, um, <makes sounds with mouth>, i don't know., i i um, no, no <laughter> regrets <laughter>, i guess.., hmm, i don't know if there's one, i mean, i'm sure there's one, but, once i went after someone, and they cut me off., and, i think it was just one of those days, like a year ago or two years ago., it was just one of those days when i just didn't want to., or i was just a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got into an accident with them, i just followed them to their parking lot, and, actually, i pissed on her and they pissed me off., and so it really came to me under the skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh, and then turn me off, so i followed them to the place and i asked, i told miss, why did you turn me off when you cut me off?, and she said oh you know i'm, i had a hard day, i don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well that you're not really a good example for your daughter and you know,, i didn't have to be so petty, but i just wanted to, i guess i wanted to be., oh, hi., <laughter>um, oh, i guess the hardest decision was to come to my mom's uh, to tell her that i was gay, i mean, it wasn't hard because it was the right one, but it was hard to do because my mother was very conservative and she, she had difficulty accepting it and it took a while, but once she knew everything was better and i knew it would be, but it was hard at the moment,, you know you're telling her something she didn't want to hear., all right., um, when i was a little kid, my.., my grandfather found our dog run over on the road, and he uh, , and brought it in and i think i just remember when i was a kid, to see death like this, really only, threw me away and, uh scared me and, it was just one of those moments for which i guess i wish i hadn't been there because my grandmother was destroyed, she was just so sad, and uh, it was just one of those moments that i think you need as a child, but i didn't really want to experience like loss in your face, yeah, that's good., my relationship with my family is pretty good around, we're probably not as close as most but uh we, you know that we always, we don't talk often, but we talk with love and we, always love each other when we see each other, um, my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me, to uh you know, pursue my dreams and, not to let the little things get me down, so i'm glad i had them, usually it's easy, sometimes it's not, um, well, i've been between jobs recently i'm starting a new job uh next week, but, while i was away while i wasn't working, i tend to, my body wants to stay up later and later and i try not to like, fall into the pattern of walking to sleep like two or three and rise like eleven, so i try to let myself sleep by midnight or twelve thirty., and i just end up lying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half, when i should, i should be able to just sleep and get up like nine, but, i guess i still want to stay up., uh a little scattered, like today i'm a little scattered, because uh, i tried to go to sleep early and i ended up throwing and turning and, so <sigh> scattered <laughter>, now that i had a lot of time on my hands, as if i didn't usually have so much time on my hands, it can sometimes be frustrating because, you don't know what to do with it if you don't work., but, yeah, that's good., i think that answers the question, to me just that maybe a little more absent than usual just lately with uh the not working thing, no, mm, a few days ago when i got my new job when i was hired, um, outgoing listening, uh attentive, um, fun, loyal, i think, i hope, i wish that i, i wish i looked better. i wish i had more hair up here mm and would have lost it a little bit., uh probably wish i was a little skinnier that, this belt is quite tight <laughter> and around, you know, sometimes i wish i had more money, but.., nothing too drastic, i'm fine., yeah, that's good., oh, uh,, when i was a little kid, i was the fat kid., and, god i remember i was like going to high school, and it was like the second day, and i remember this guy came to me and was, um, how he was like pretty nice to me i thought, and i didn't know that he, as if it were from a movie, just like he had put bandaids on my back, who said i was a fat cow., and said how uh like, yeah, that's good., like a bunch of mean things and i didn't know it and i walked around with him for half an hour i heard people laughing and i didn't get it and then finally this girl just came to me and was like hey, there's like bandaids on your back saying all these mean things and then she just walked away, she didn't want to help me take them away, and i remember how i couldn't get it, i tried to find it and then, um, i just remember how to put my head in my locker and how, i didn't want anyone to see me cry, so i put my head in my locker., and as if i were looking at things in my backpack, but really i was you know, the crying fat child who couldn't get the mean stickers from his back, yeah., anything, um, likely, yeah, that's good., <sharp inhalation>, um, you know, i would i would try to keep, i would try to let myself know to look at things positively and not like worrying about what other people think about you, i think i spent too much time like a teenager, worrying what people thought of me, and when i got older, i didn't care so much and i started to enjoy life so much more, uh i went to coachella it's a music festival it's been three days with, all my friends and my friend and we, uh we danced and we went swimming and we grilled and we laughed and had a great time, yeah, that's good., oh, um, i guess my, my career modest as it may be, i really spend a long time in l a, when it was uh, when it was hard i stayed < stay> i stayed around i didn't stop so, you know, i'm proud that i managed to follow my dreams and really stay out here and, try to do it in hollywood, it's my pleasure., see you., see you., see you.",4
407,"yes, <clears throat> i'm actually feel <f> i feel pretty good 'cause i uh, i slept, all day yesterday almost and i usually i'm doing something if it's not work it's school if it's not school, it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school, i only have school on the weekdays, so i actually slept probably like, eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good, but i'm actually kinda tired as well and i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today, i'm originally from bakersfield, california, really, uh i moved to l_a when i was an infant and then, i left here when i was around three or four, and i've been move i moved back here, in oh seven and i've been living here, um ever since, um, wow since i've been here since oh seven i've only been back maybe <clears thoat>, maybe like, a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer, like in oh, eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here, unfortunately, uh <sigh> uh <laughter>, uh it compares to l_a, um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i, anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um, l_a has all the stuff to do it has um, oceans and it's by all kinds of um located, um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh, san diego and what have you not so <s> um, but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss, like the actual city, i just miss uh some of the people that, i grew up with, oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of, california like six times so, i would like to travel, once i uh, have enough money to do so, um, well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker, and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um, studying <stu> i was, took i took communications and uh, did general ed stuff too and um, took like video production classes and um <tisk>, did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking, and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back, here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento, but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be, uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done, with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and, become an optician so, but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans, and i still actually i got into um playing poker, a few years ago and i really like, the idea of becoming, a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are, extremely difficult to make a living out of and you, have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then, hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere, to be an optician, oh um, uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but, it just like specifically, trains you into um, one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and, all these other classes like you normally would do for like um, like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field, i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si>, it sound like something maybe i could do, it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually, um got my attention to be an optician so, i'm now trying to be an optician, and it's interesting so, it's fun it's um, really hard but it's interesting and it, and it um, and it's it's fun it has um rewarding, um, rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see, better and feel comfortable with, glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel, more comfortable with, cool, uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy, sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because, talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon, or uh animated or whatever <laughter>, so, cool, but no usually ninety eight percent, um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe, this might go for some of the poker players too um, i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like, um i actually, playing poker is um, actually something that, helps me forget about anything as far as like um, stuff in the past or present, um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela>, i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy, thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past, i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however, playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um, catch twenty two or whatever but uh, yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball, i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually, one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does, um it makes me feel good, but it i didn't go, i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the, cold season, so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter>, um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like, i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and, all six of 'em were started by the other person, so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but, talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like, thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been, a couple times maybe in the past where like i, wasn't able to control it, but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would, but for um, majority of the time yeah i don't have like, people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um, on the freeway and stuff but uh, oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really, um petty things i guess that maybe we just, i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh, we just bumped heads too much so, obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so, we just argued about, girlfriend boyfriend things, uh, um, i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um, handled differently, there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh, uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and, i was um working for, , production assistant for filmmakers around, um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned, and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment, and then i got involved with like uh the wrong, group of people i guess and, kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment, so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with, those kind of people that kinda of girl, um uh, ever, uh because <clears throat> i woulda, probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason, and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh, <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um, not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so, you know, mm, hardest decision i guess, i guess uh hardest decision, the hardest decision i have ever had to make, would be um, i guess you could say uh i don't really know, was gonna say that uh, maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like, stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh, would like to be with her and miss her, but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like, i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and, i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that, i don't think it would end up working out anyways so, i guess the decision my hardest decision would be, to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her, and uh, be uh not with her so, i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um, i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been, happier in that way but stressed out and, um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so, it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it, not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me, or whatever so, cool, oh what was that, i beg your pardon, nevad, i don't understand the first part of that question, oh an event, oh an event okay um that i could erase, uh event that i could from my memory, uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her, my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w>, we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard, so, i guess both of them, oh it's extremely easy i could fall asleep, anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would've been weird because i guess i would've, fallen down or something i don't know i just caught myself, i guess i was really <r> i mean i was really tired but i i do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep, as much as i would like <l> like but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever so, as they say, <tisk> uh no, no, uh lately i'm just tired but i'm alright i guess, i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month an a week, but it's actually it's not i mean i've had worse things happen i mean worse things happen, had worse things happen so yeah, i guess, well i'm a religious person i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so um i obviously even all of it even devoted, people to god um regardless of what they are they uh sometimes lose faith so i do lose faith sometimes but it doesn't really last for that long and i know that there is a god i know, that i'll be okay and that everything will be okay but you know it's hard um deal with them i i don't really i just keep going you know go to school and work, and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just, try to stay busy and, staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping, a lot helps but i don't get to sleep a lot so, um i don't know, uh playing poker, playing basketball, deals helps me deal with it and like uh, hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes, why, uh uh, uh i felt really happy on friday because um, i went to san diego for the first time, and uh i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it was gonna be but uh we were like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so, i would've much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i was had fun and i was, happy about going to san diego for the first time and i um, had a good time, oh, she's, um <laughter>, a lot of things but i guess i would say like, be nicer to like um, family members you know a couple family members that i wish i would've been, different to um, acted different to not that i was like a horrible but i could've been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh, i would've never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did, like high school and different part times of out of high school i would've just, really focused on um schooling and stuff and then, did the partying later uh wouldn't have gotten relationships that um so i would've just told myself more basically to be more, uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh, stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but <sniffle> um yeah i just would've done a lot of stuff different but, i um i don't know if i said this earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason, um, so i guess everything's happening, now for a reason, so i'm just gonna keep going, uh, <tisk> i guess they would the few that i do have or few that i used to have 'cause i have best friends now a couple i guess one new one, and i've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like went out own ways but i guess they would all probably describe me more as like, um happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy, uh loud uh, silly, uh smart, and uh, i just in i guess in uh in general just like, entertaining to be around, have, i haven't always <a> always been the best bestest best friend but i try you know my hardest, so that's it like, cool, um <sigh>, change myself uh, <tisk> i wish i was um, < > i wish i was like fifteen pounds lighter, um, i wish i didn't need, uh, how do i say put this uh i feel like, um, i feel like i'm a i feel like i, i need to be like in a relationship with a girl, i feel like i wish i didn't have to be, like feel like, that i needed to have a girl all the time, and so i could that could help me like focus more, and i wish that like i didn't need, sexual um, i wasn't always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like, me having to be in a sexual, thing with them like, as far as like wanting sex as much as i do 'cause i feel like, if i didn't concentrate or have to do, like get be with girls or in a relationship to like, well who i don't know how to say it but i'm just saying like i there's like guy friends that i know, that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need <n> need it as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit, where like i i could focus on more things other than just, i mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like if focus on if i didn't want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get more stuff done in my life, but, yeah so i'm trying i'm working on that, <deep breath> <sigh> what am i most proud of, uh, i'm most proud of, <makes sounds with mouth> the the, i'm most proud <prou> oh i guess i guess i'm most proud of working for um television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of um, film sets 'cause like i, i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then, two years later a year and a half later basically i got i started making steps to become a filmmaker and then i ended up working <wor>, working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really, really um, really um, good um cinematographer a really good um freelance cinematographer that was based that lives in sacramento they did a lot of things so i'm proud that had a dream and i went for it and i and actually ended up doing stuff to go towards my dream that were in my dream so, um yeah i guess that's one of my biggest accomplishments

to see her there., it's pretty cold <laughter>, i didn't like that., on this special journey, or, um, i don't know her., made us this uh like canadian food, i think it's poutine or something., so i

um, i don't know how two days ago, i was arguing with my sister about something., oh yeah <laughter> i really don't remember anything, stupid, i think she, i don't know that she borrowed something from me and she didn't return it in time <laughter>, um, i don't know, i guess, i mean, i wish i didn't lose my temper so fast., sometimes, but this doesn't happen so often, um, i don't know, i think thinking more before i talk, then maybe i won't lose my temper <laughter>, um, i wish i could erase it from my memory., i don't know, i just guess, like uh negative people, or something negative i've met before, i guess i just want to delete, the thought of meeting them, all right., had like friends who just like, not very good company and, they're just very, not very good influences so, yeah, i'd just want to delete them, but i'm not friends with them anymore, so.., um, my, who is a positive influence, my family is a positive influence <laughter>, and my friends now, oh, it's pretty good., i, talk to them a lot, i see them a lot, so, yeah, that's good., mm, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, i don't know <laughter>, i guess.., what i wanted to study at college maybe, it's not that hard, but <laughter> it's a little bit, it's a, big decision, information technology, thank you., yes a little <laughter> not, not so much, but a little, well, i got it when i came into it when i was a teenager so, i guess i'm just.., and i was good at it, so i just thought,, i'd continue to study it., for higher at a higher level, yeah, a little bit, but i.., uh, somehow i wanted to, i tried to make a decision between that and the arts., so, yeah, i'm just glad i did., my dream job <laughter>, uh fashion designer <laughter>, yeah, that's good., how hard work is, um, i don't think it's a hard job <laughter> i like clothes and, tissues and, making such clothes so i don't think it's a hard job, i fall asleep like within five minutes, depending on how tired i am, i am very irritable

guess how, a week ago or so i went to, i went to, where did i go?, i went to this event., in the city center, it was like a, art walk thing, so it was exciting, thank you., oh, it was different., art around galleries and stuff in the city center, they only exhibit their work and, i don't know that it was just interesting to walk around and see all this., um, i think i'm, generous, um, patients, i think, i'm a good friend <laughter>, um, i think i'm working hard., and, what else is it?, yeah, i know., that's it, i think., um, i wish i were more absent, like a more social person, and, um, what else is it?, i don't know and i wish i was like i don't think about, not easy to get around, anger like, you got a temper or something., oh, no, it's not in trouble, it's just, sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people, i'm getting a temper , but i have never got into trouble or, mm, really bad no, um, i can't think <laughter>, um, i guess,, i was in, i was once in an elevator and this person, as if they were running towards him, and, as if i had tried to think it was her, but i couldn't reach it in time and they liked to start cursing me like i really felt bad because they probably thought i wouldn't try to open it for them, but, yeah, that's good., it was that <laughter>, um, everything i regret i don't really i do well yes i regret about, not, contact like old friends i knew, so i guess, yeah, maybe i'll do that in the future, i know her from primary school, yeah, but we've lost contact over the years., because i changed schools., empty the throat , for now i mean, oh okay um, i don't know, i guess i'd just say, um, learn as much as i can and, i don't just know, don't hold back so much, with how to, how not to be, i think i'd tell myself to be., more outgoing

places, uh because uh i was engaged to my fianc e and we lived in florida, i moved there to be with him and, he loves the water, but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i loved florida not, and he wasn't connected, so we decided to go somewhere where we could both be happy, and also have more opportunities in the economy and, all the great things it has to offer, very light, there's not much i don't like about l a, i love it, i think it feels magical, uh so many creative different people, of all age groups, around shapes sizes colors breeds, um, the mountains the water, uh, the

can really control my temper., for the most part, before i came here <laughter>, um, it was just about.., financial stress, uh, um, there are probably a lot of examples, i think i'd rather move on to another question, yeah, i'd rather not talk about it, either <laughter>, i'd rather not talk about it., not very easy at all, um, it's been a lot better lately, but.., i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so, it's a challenge., not to feel rested most of the time, last week i felt much better, yeah, i know., the weather has changed spring has jumped it's a little warmer i had, for more trouble with my depression in winter and around, difficulties with tolerating cold, and so i don't have a lot of things i usually do, and i was also sick with the flu, um, and last week, i decided, um.., that i felt better enough, that somehow i had to get out of my rod and start to, more and more focused on things i have to do during the day and my dog every day on foot and around, do not isolate so much, and see some of my friends more, so i saw, i feel much better than i've made progress and.., last week things have taken a more positive turn, no, yes, uh, it's been official for quite a long time, it's probably already, i don't know exactly, but let's see, maybe more than fifteen years ago, i felt suicidal., no, because i've found a better alternative, i've been in therapy since i was 18., and i've tried a variety of methods, and then i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer, and that was really the first person who, to have helped me, uh make permanent changes and i was able to get my antidepressants as well, and even though with some fights of, depression has never been anything, extremely heavy and around it was, one of the best things that ever happened, i was physically ill., with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client who referred me to that person, because he had healed them from this disease, and, um, that was.., treats several expenditures and so, everything is connected to each other, so to, once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me, i was so happy, i felt like i was something.., i felt that, i found the answer i was looking for that i hadn't given up hope and uh, that.., <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i, i had suffered for a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally, found, the answer to the, the solution i was looking for was like, it was the best thing i've ever done in my life, it was the best decision i've ever made., i felt, extremely hopeful for the first time in a long time, i went to my place., i was at a music store., because i had thought about it, i recorded an instrument that i played., the violin as a child and uh, i wanted to do something., that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it was extremely suppressed, and, and so i went to the music shop to try out, to see what it feels like, um, to handle the instrument again, nan, and see if i thought that was something i wanted to pursue, it was fantastic <laughter>, mm, yeah, i'd rather not talk about it <laughter>, um, all right., there's probably a lot, but.., i'm always working on being more optimistic., it's difficult, it takes time, but.., yes, i wish i could hear my own, internal voice better, <laughter> yeah i'm sure i regret yeah, um, appreciate me more so that i would make better, relationship decisions, uh, my fianc e is the most positive, person in my life, my ultimate supporter, he's i think very unique not uh, not at all

477,", yes, thank you., thank you, how are you?, i grew up in oklahoma, mhm, i moved to i a five and a half years ago, so i used to be in the west on the east coast and then i decided to come here., my home town not very often around most of my family moved away so i visit them, but i didn't really go back to oklahoma much, < sniffle>, oklahoma is quite different around, uh l a is much more exciting, there is much more to, to do here and to, uh the sea is obviously very nice so, um, you know that's a good question., i wanted to try something new and i always loved the beach and, i thought uh and i also like big cities, so i thought l a could come a good place for me, very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i've ever made, < slaughter>, pretty easy i think around anyway it seems kind of natural, it seemed like a good fit, i just really like it here., oh, it's great, i've got some roommates and we're really getting out of here i live a few blocks from the beach, every day i can walk on the beach or, you know, hanging out with friends, and it's just like being on vacation all the time, it's really nice., mm, i studied philosophy and political theory and government, and made a little english literature on the page, um it, i think it just happened., i went to liberal art school and got a kind of exposure to a lot of different, areas and, i simply followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that, um, not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit, so i work with graduates <grad> with graduates around in the social sciences and humanities, but i don't really use my philosophy background very often., <laughter>um, you know that i actually studied to become a success coach, so, i work with students is a kind of nicer, aspect of doing, but i would really like to work with others <o> with other people so not only students, but to help them achieve their goals and realize their dreams, i'd say it's pretty hard in the sense that, um, you know, it can be a challenge for people, actually, are motivated and do all the work that is required to, made to realize their dreams, but and it is also a challenge because there is a life in it, uh requires the collection of money so to find people who are willing to pay for it can also be difficult, i'm definitely on the shy side i'm an introvert so, i'm pretty good at a situation with people, but if you get me in a group with more than a few people, i'm very much an observer, so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not so engaged, and i think this is, something that goes it is noticed by others and it is perhaps a little strange for them especially if they are not introverted, so i would say, and it's also a challenge for me, i tend not to be the person who imagines himself in a room full of strangers., <laughter> pretty good, i think, but i have a temperament so i can get upset from time to time., not really around it can be a challenge when i drive < laughter> but other than that no, hmm, hmm, i'm not sure., it would probably have been a discussion about politics., and it would probably have been a friendly argument, um, probably with one of my liberal friends so, but i can't remember the appointed time, < slaughter>, < sniffle>, mm, i'm meditating, for the, do it almost every day, i also go to the beach i love the sea and i like the sounds and just out there is very peaceful, and i like to read and am alone with my thoughts, that's nice., mm, let me think about it for a second., <sigh>, hmm, <laughter> i have a hard time coming with everything i mean, i'm sure there are many things around, simply nothing comes to mind <sniffle>, <sigh>, hmm, okay, i'm sorry <laughter>, hmm, well, that's not exactly an event, it's a dream and it's not special, go to traumatic dream as far as dreams, but, i have it sometimes., probably more often than i want so that i wouldn't be upset if it, do you know if i didn't have it?, um, and it's just a version of a dream i think a lot of people probably have, but.., i'm usually in school somewhere., at the end of the semester, i didn't go to class to do the exams, i'll fail., and, you know really unhappy about why not i, learn and attend class as i should, um, that was actually no problem for me at school, but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating, and i'm not quite sure, why i mean, i know why, but i don't know what it's about, because it's not like i'm consciously worried, at least about the failure things so, no, i don't think so., at least not that i'm aware of it., < sniffle>, i feel guilty, i have a brother and a sister in law and a nephew., and they live on the east coast, and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and around, i lived there when he was younger., to spend a lot of time with them and, since i was in california, and especially last year, i've spent a lot less time trying to, for example, i saw her for a week at christmas and then i went back, in <i> at the beginning of may, so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i had seen her, and that i felt bad because, we enjoy each other's company and he, you know, i really like being there, but then he gets angry when i go and he asks when i'm coming back., so this is.., that makes me bad sometimes, mm, um, well, i have a brother, i'm very close to him, he's younger., and, he's four and a half years younger., he's married, i have a nephew., my two parents died., so it's just the two of us and we have a large, extended family, but we're not that close to most of them., um, on my father's side is a brother, um, and he's married and has a couple of kids, so i have some cousins on this side, but then on my mother's side there's, <sigh> five <fi> four or five other children, most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on this site, but they live throughout the country and around, so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook around and there a few i talk to on the phone and visit from time to time, but you know we're not so close to our extended family, um, i would say well, i mean, i have a lot of friends that i think were positive influences, , when i came to california, um, i started at a non profit work and it was kind of a strange place, it was very different from what i was used to, it was a bit challenging and she also worked there so, we worked on a joint program over the summer and got to know each other and, we have just built up this really strong friendship and, she's kind of, i'd say, my best friend probably here and probably only in general, and now she's moved to vegas, which is a bit tough for me., but we're going to napa this weekend, so it should be good, but she was a very good woman, because when i came here and didn't really know anyone, she was very positive., and you know, since i'm an introverter, it's not that easy for me to make friends, it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know, i think she's kind of bringing me, so it's a lot of fun hanging out with her and that was nice, i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy around, sometimes i know you know., depending on how long i'm awake < clears throat> i can get hurt < wou> a little upset and so sometimes i need to take a while to decompress, but, i usually meditate right before i go to bed and that's very helpful, um, and i can sleep, uh, you know, i sleep generally in 90 minute cycles., so, you know, usually six or seven and a half hours, but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination, i don't usually wake up in the middle of the night., or at least if i don't remember, so, well, i don't actually sleep very well when i travel, is one of the things i do for work, that i travel, a little bit, because i work for a company that's in the east, so i work from home, most of the time but then i travel, like a week in a month, and when i travel, i take the red eye, um, and then i'm going to visit with many friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i, sleep, bad or bad it's just that i don't have so much time to sleep, and on the first day, after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay, but usually the second day is not very good, so i get much tireder uh and it's harder to concentrate, and, i don't know it feels like a fight., i'd say good., um, summer is a little <l> is a busy time for the organization i work for, so i'm a little, i don't know if stress is the right word, but i know i'm a little worried., everything is going well this summer, but in general i feel pretty good, i can't think of anything., there's one thing i'm fighting for with exercise as i like walking around a lot, and i wander with friends and, to i was really motivated to go for a few months, but then i went away to the east coast and when i came back, i was much less motivated, because i didn't really train when i was there., and i had been out of habit, although it was only about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try to get back into the routine and it's not as good as i want, it's okay., thank you., no, no, all right., , he's having a lot of fun and, he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and, we're going to make a book club now, so we're going to skype and, maybe i get more time with him so but uh just being around him is fun, hmm, <sigh>, she'd probably say i know how to have fun., but that i can be serious, and, that i know you care about others, uh, and that i'm loyal, and, i'm not sure what else, um, i think those are probably the most important things., < sniffle>, i wish i had more self discipline, so, um, i wish you knew i could diet or eat healthier foods and not have a problem, uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar, i wish i wouldn't postpone because i got much better about it, but i still do, and that can be a challenge, um, and i wish i.., , i don't know., uh, i think i wish i was in a relationship, so, probably those things, mm, hmm, so at the last organization i worked with, i had a boss and she was, i don't feel like she's.., i don't think we were very compatible., i pressed my buttons or so i thought, and so on, one day she was really upset about something because a board member called her and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer., um, and he was upset about something and, it was something to do with my department, so she called me to her office and let me know how unhappy she was, um, but it wasn't me being a manager for many years around and i, have very strong opinions about how you treat, challenges with people <peo> with employees, and the way she treated the situation with me was really inappropriate, i thought., she wanted to scare me and make me feel., you know, incompetent or at least that's the way i thought about it., and, i knew it., i tried to be very calm and, said i'd take care of it, and i took care of it., after that our relationship was not the same anymore and i stayed left there in the end <st> uh, to go back to the old organization for which i hadn't worked so long after, because i just didn't really have much respect for her after she did this to me., or after we had this interaction so, < slaughter>, so i heard this advice the other day and or so, thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish i had, read it then, this is, when you think about buying something instead of thinking, uh oh, here's this beautiful coat that costs 100 bucks i'm going to buy., it uh don't think it's as cost a hundred dollars think it's as cost ten times that, because that's effective what your money could do if you don't spend it on this coat, but it invests it, you know, intelligent, you'd have ten times as much money., you really should think about it in these terms and i think i was much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i could uh, ten or twenty years ago, i was more aware of this, <sigh> probably, , they asked me to be his sponsor and his guardian if anything happened to them., and that meant a lot to me because it made me feel that they trusted me and thought i was a good person who could take care of their child if something happened to them., so, <sigh> let's see, good uh in <i> it wasn't really recent but in february i liked to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore, uh and i have to fly first class, we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get those around, tickets and so uh that was really pleasant because, to pull the seats down you get to sleep the food is delicious, you get special attention and i was also not in singapure before, so that was kind of cool too, safe, thank you., see you.",2

466,", <sigh>, yes, uh, okay., < slaughter>, the angels, the weather, um, the diversity of the environments of the ocean you know different environment or environment diversity, < slaughter>, i don't like the superficiality of people., around the narcissistic attitude around, i'm just.., the, it doesn't have a small town where you feel., they only know the heat the human type of heat interactively, so, yeah, that's good., no, i'm afraid of flying, and i've developed agoraphobia., < slaughter>, uh incredibly difficult, yeah, i guess you mean the agoraphobia more than the fear of flying., it's more of a new development and.., it's.., oh, it goes on, <pregr> continue to get worse, uh, it's very.., what's the word?, immobilization and and very oppressive, mhm <laughter> yes it is, how to cope with it, just.., i'm just trying to uh, do what i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in order to take small steps, to i read a lot i read to bibliotherapy read around, and i try to inform myself, the professional literature so that i can hopefully overcome it one day, mhm, uh, yeah, definitely., um, uh certain things trigger it like around closed rooms, um, travel in a car around, i'm away from home to be in someone else's car., things beyond my control, um, uh actually i'm not going to school right now, my dream job is, to be a psychologist <laughter>, i'm not a psychologist, but what would make me do that is.., uh, to have experienced some challenges such as these, to have experienced some traumas, but i've always had an interest in it since the junior high of, um, uh, i am very interested in people and in the human interaction and in the human connection and, to make these things better.., bridging people and helping people in person through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges around, uh, so this is kind of about it in a summary, um, i think i'm someone who, i can be very outgoing and somehow a warm and friendly presence very light, but i think on <o> on the outside around, but i think i'm shy and i challenge to do that, i think i'm shy in my heart, but i challenge myself because i love human interaction, so i take these risks and jump and these challenges., the last time i interacted with someone was <laughter> today, when i think i understand your question right, oh no no anyway i think i'm misunderstanding your question, but i interacted with rachel around i'm just to interact continuously with people, take these risks, um, very good., mm, very good <laughter>, um, when was the last time i had a fight with someone?, i can't remember it wasn't new <laughter>, i have to think that i don't know yet., i draw an empty.. i can only remember things.., of when i was like twenty one <laughter> now, i can't think of anything contemporary right now., my mind is, okay, when i was younger, yeah, i lost it., a relationship with my aunt, and my uncle and my cousins, for when i was twenty one, i was forty five, um, i um, uh, uh, had a disagreement with my aunt and i said something that was uh critical, from her and, she threw me out of her house., and, uh, leave me back to uh i apologized immediately, and they left me in their lives, and changed her mind so, i regret that, um, i suppose you mean, how did i feel when they asked me never to be in their lives again?, and to leave, shattered soul shattered heart shattered, well, that was my family, the.., the good side of my family is around uh, the majority of my family, they were the loving aspect of my family, the rest of my family, is very cruel and how very abusive., i don't have a relationship with my family at all., how the, since i.., twenty one since my aunt and uncle., uh, denies me i think is the right word, estranged yes, um, i'm drawing an empty bear with me for a second., um, something i could erase., <laughter> i can't even remember it, um, uh as an example to, uh, i was hurt and i wish i could get that away from my memory, yeah, i know., i was injured in the er., , i went in for food poisoning., from a doctor around i had collapsed and, i was instructed to go to the e r because i said food poisoning and i came out with a neurological syndrome injured i was with an injured, what do you call that?, uh intravenous procedure uh and now i've got uh, r s d reflex like dystrophy, and it was the scene in the emergency room, it was a scene out of control, there was a problem with the procedure., and the doctor cried out to his staff, who made a mistake., um, eh and it was extremely painful around it was a crisis, and so every time i think about it, the injury and it was uh disfiguring i was disabled, um, for <f> i uh was disabled for it uh permanently around from it i was also around, uh hindered by my employment for quite a lot of quite a lot of time as well, and, and i have left it around, physical trauma of him and distortion and around, severe disability < disabil> disability limited by, um, functionality uh with my right my, i'm right handed uh with my right hand, and arm, thank you., i don't even know what that is., um, i, you know i really do., i apologize because i can't give you this., uh the most appropriate answer to, uh, i guess it had something to do with.., my cat and her, your urgent uh, um, what do you call it?, she was in intensive care and i'm sure it had something to do with it., um, but unlike that, i would say that i chose my way of life if, , um, and uh, i was admitted to this program., or if i went to art school for four years.., and i had to choose a way of life, but that's not a traumatic situation., i don't know how to answer your question., i can't., um, i just.., severe nightmares <laughter> and i have to be nocturnal, uh panic attacks, and i also have physical illness on it and i am in painful pain, yes, yes, yeah, they're triggered by the injury i told you., they're being triggered by my family., um, they treated me, what they told me, what they did to me., they're triggered by.., what else around mine around my physical illness not my injury only but my physical, sickness also, so yes., um, i feel very sick, and, feel so tired, very sick and very tired, um, when i don't sleep and sleep enough around uh my anxiety level i think is up and, i'm receptive to feeling depressed., um, so yes., yes, about three years ago around my latest um diagnosis, and in two thousand and one,, uh yes, um, three years ago and around, when i.., 20 years old, around the background of my childhood, from my family of origin around, and their around uh, you know the abuse i've been through., uh and her ultimate um uh, what's the word?, rejection from me and alienation, that was the first reason, um, no, i quit six months ago., <sigh> um, why did i stop to just take a break <laughter> i'll continue, yes very, it has helped tremendously, um, i think it helps with fear it helps with, um, it helps to inspire to create inspiration it helps to, um, uh feeling connected, to help create what i'm ultimately about my goal,, to give me a voice and to, um, uh it helps to do <d> to uh, it's part of this process., it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself., um, and anyway there are only as many advantages it is, i, i'll stop right away, there's a lot more., mhm, um, the last time i felt really happy, it was a really long time ago around it was before my illness, um and it was in nineteen ninety seven around the beginning of my illness was in july of ninety seven so it was around before that <laughter>, yeah., i was in a very good place, in terms of my career., in order to , um, just my relationships and um everything was kind of best around, career relations, personal fulfillment around somehow, also around i was very active and did, many things that were meaningful to build a life and i was in the process of, especially in the planning stages of my life, but also very successful, at the same time, so it was just things just went very well and around i just really liked uh, the place where my life was only in a really good place in many ways, mhm, i wish i could change about myself., i wish i could change for my agoraphobia., my p t s d around means my trauma around and around, uh, what else.., um, my insecurity, as far as.., uh, just.., with <w> with other people in the sense that i always try to make sure that, that i don't do something that.., wait a second., i'm just trying to make sure i don't do anything that offends or offends her., um, or uh is disrespectful uh and i feel like i'm too careful about it and uh, it will somehow be a fear for itself, so i definitely think that would be useful, to change the other thing i want to change about myself, i wish i could feel, and also depression that i want to change about myself. i wish i could feel better., i wish i wasn't feeling., um, um.., i don't wish i didn't have the burden i'm doing., my family doesn't have one., um, i wish i hadn't had my illness and the physical, um, agonizing pain i'm in, so these are some things.., and i also wish that, and this is a by product of p t s d i wish i hadn't had to, uh, symptomology, of p t s d, because this is definitely about, affects a complete <com> completely the complete life like anyway a lot of their impact on their life uh completely, and i wish i were more articulate, and i wish i was someone who was well spoken, and someone who is well written, but there are many more., things i wish i could change about myself to improve myself, so many more, <sigh> um, i'm not sure., < sniffle>, maybe not to be so trusting, i have faith., i trusted some doctors that.., you know, again caused the injury, and, you know that, there's a uh, what's the word?, there is an expectation and a kind of demand to live up to, blind trust for the medical profession and, <sniffle> um, don't ask any questions and just somehow change, you know, and when and not to trust your own self your own around your own instincts or intuition, and so i would, i would have told myself to be more careful., i guess if that's what it is, useful for your question, < sniffle>, what did i really like?, you know i can't figure anything out., but.., i know it should be.., either read or re read, connecting with someone on a meaningful level, < sniffle>, i'm very proud of.., my compassion, um, my around my uh empathy and caring for people, um, i mean, i'm proud of it., but also especially <sniffle> around i come from a, to an environment that is the opposite to a background and i was not taught that < sniffle> but i really care about the people and about, i'm very proud that i'm proud of my career, too., benefits, around and mine for perseverance around my grim <fie> my grim perseverance to be successful, to <sniffle> and uh, you know, just to get the power that it takes to get through, injury, uh living with it and living with the disease i live with the physical illness, um, so i think that's it., < sniffle>, yes, all right., you're welcome., see you.",9
369,"sure yeah, i'm doing great thank you for asking um, you know how about yourself, oh awesome, uh i'm from guatemala, my parents here migrated here to the united states when i was like three years

cousins aunts uncle so, practically i i have my my life here so i probably, i mean it would be nice to visit but, you know it just does my curiousity hasn't you know gone there i guess, oh okay, um i love the people everyone's nice i love the diversity you know there's different types of, people and you know the imaginations out there everything is just great, you know everyone's different you know no one's like the same at at least to some aspects, um and i love the scenery i love the you know mountains they're beautiful, you know great for hikes you know taking out you know the dog the family you know, it's nice it's pretty active yeah, uh the smog <laughter>, uh i don't like the smog it's just, you know if you go out um further out you know you could tell by the air you know or, you know everything's clearer the sky is bluer <laughter> um but other than that like you know and traffic <laughter> nobody likes traffic i think, yeah, yeah but um, yeah that's you know pretty much l_a is pretty nice you know it's i like it, um, well i was studying just basic you know um i'm not sure exactly what i wanna be so it's just kind of you know, here and there just jumping through hoops and stuff so, not really, set yet it's just i'm still trying to find my interests i suppose, so, um my dream job hm, that's a good one, um i love working with children so i would say probably a child psychologist just 'cause you know it's great, you know to learn what's going on in the young minds, and you know how we could help children develop a better way, you know make children you know or help, you know help them you know grow up in a positive way i supposed instead of like going the wrong track, yeah, i just you know help children, uh it depends it depends on the situation i'm in sometimes you know i could be like super outgoing and just like you know, and sometimes like it just i could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention you know if i'm like in class or whatever, i don't really like and there's everyone talking i just i'd prefer just to, stay away from that you know 'cause i need something else to concentrate on something else you know there's like a moment and time for everything i suppose, yeah, um, i like to kick my feet up on the couch and like read a good book you know just, get my mind going to another you know, galaxy or universe or, situation you know it's pretty fun you know just, you know reading and then just having just, yourself relaxed and you know feeling good, yeah it is it's just fun i love reading, um, i'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know temper controlling person there is out there, you know i try my best and i guess that's all i could do until i keep, doing better eventually, but i'm not like the best, i mean i sometimes i do have my outbursts you know um, but you know i guess that's everyone, i'm not sure haha you know, uh huh, that's a good question, um hm, i don't remember <laughter> uh let's see uh, honestly i can't recall maybe, uh, my goodness, i i don't know <laughter> i've i've uh sometimes i'm very passive that i'll just like let things go 'cause i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things, you know so um, huh i don't know, i'm not i i i can't honestly i can't tell you that <laughter> at this moment, sure yeah probably come back to it, um, huh, well i guess, when i was younger i you know uh could've been better older sister and i i wasn't, and that makes me feel guilty for sure, you know i could've been a better sister, better role model <laughter> you know but i'm trying my best now so i'm trying to make things better, and it's working <laughter>, yeah, woo um i guess huh, hm, i don't know i mean, i'm the person that i am because of the events that have happened in my life so, if i erase something then it just there's something of me in my present self or you know that would change and, i don't know i'm pretty okay with the person that i am now i mean, you know i don't think i would change an event, you know i'm i'm okay with what, you know ups and downs and good and bad that has happened, so, yeah, uh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot um, but i am kind of like an explorer i guess i love to explore like, even the smallest things like if i go hiking i go off trail and you know just find my way up to the top, you know

i wasn't getting uh my tasks done in time uh this < the> those were some of the problems, i felt good, but, uh, no, i don't know., i started doing yoga, and you know that i've been doing it for about a year, and, that's uh and meditation and that helped a lot, uh, it's just that you know when i was diagnosed with depression, i thought i shouldn't take any medication for it., and i looked at uh uh other ways to get about the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and, they know i was influenced by them., it's a bit difficult, but i could sleep in half an hour., there are days when it takes almost a two hours to go to sleep uh, they are what you can repeat,, uh no, all i know is that you know., just turn off the light and you know, throw around and, uh, try to focus on things that make me feel good, and this and the, um, about <bout> three days ago, what i'm proud of, uh i was in i i was among the best two percent in my m b a class and, um, and when i ran my business i designed a product around, that worked very well., and uh i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful to my business, uh, my, i think my friends would describe

thinking and uh the first few times i read about him about his uh, theories, i had trouble really understanding that., and, uh, that you know that we do, i mean, when is when there are things i really try to understand and i'm not able to, me and uh you know there's the kind of people i admire, listen to other people, uh it's varied around and i like the entertainment industry, and uh, i like uh, yes the fact that there are more women here than men, < slaughter>, um, uh there are certain areas in which only spanish <spa> uh where only spanish is spoken uh you know i would like uh for all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english, so that everyone can participate, um, in l a, um, i mean like i, some of the things the political leaders do, uh, really drives me crazy, sometimes i think they're wasting their time, moving forward our time and other countries., and, you know these guys don't do things, and you know that's why i feel very bad, and sometimes it makes me angry., uh, yeah, that's good., i mean the first four years of uh, obama administration, i'd think it was wasted because, if the, if congress, had acted jointly, uh anyway, things have been done, then you know that we're going to be, maybe we could have made it much harder for china to catch up., and you know that china is able to do things and do things much faster., and these people still know about you uh argue and uh, you know, find <fi> uh find faults with each other and don't do things, you know, they don't seem to realize that you know the clock is

414,"yeah, that's good., i'm fine., burbank california, yeah, that's good., the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather, um, it's not too, city like chicago or new york, it's big enough that we have beaches that we haven't locked., sometimes the smog, transport, the fact that i was just here, like my whole life almost, not enough because i'd like to go to school in chicago., and i've been to new york a few times, san francisco and i made a road trip through the country, that was cool i saw a few states, see new places, um, go to places of interest that i only have, over or seen images of, um, i traveled from los angeles to chicago under route sixty six, and the best part was to see the grand canyon for the first time, it was, the coolest thing i've ever seen, probably <laughter>, happy, and then it was just happy it was nice it was nice, i haven't felt that way in a long time., i studied film., it's just, something i've always loved as long as i can remember and when it came time to start, i wasn't sure what i was going to do., and, i applied to the northwest as a film student, and it just ended up as the right decision, oh,, um, i love making movies, but part of me really loves, make people laugh and stand in front of the camera, so, uh, comedian a comedian <comie> <laughter> comedian actor would be awesome, but, that's hard <laughter>, i'm super exiting, and i love talking to people, i like to be the center of attention usually <laughter>, i um, i like watching mindless tv, how to, small children in tiaras and around, entendynastie only t v programs where i really don't have to pay attention to all, i'm fine., i, really getting, emotional really fast, but i'm usually, be able to , to keep my anger down and not like eyelashes on others and so on, for the most part, sometimes, i get in like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are really easy to care about, and i hate to apologize to people so the fights can take quite a long time, um, my best friend <laughter> ryan i think, and it was about, our relationship and only, how we kind of messed it up and crossed some boundaries and, how about we get back to the way it was before?, really hard, it's.., he's my best friend and i miss him., but, we screwed it up, and it's just not the same thing., it's not like the same friendship <laughter>, me too <laughter>, <laughter>, i guess.., , when i had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend, which was not okay, i wish i had just, realized that this was bad, and would have just stopped there and not let it go on for weeks, which has led to my separation., and then our friendship gets really messed up, i don't appreciate spending as much time with him as i did, be more confident, um, i guess.., it was, november, i was very depressed and suicidal, so i told my friend., what i felt, and that she had to take me to the e r, and from the e r i had the choice,, i don't know, i guess i'm going home or being sent to a psychiatric clinic., and even though i felt that i had no choice, i knew it was my choice and i, decided to go to the psychiatric clinic that was like the worst experience of my life ever, um, exhale it was terrible, it was in chicago and around, it was scary., i mean, i didn't know anybody, and they like all your stuff, and they put you in some scrubs, and they just.., start giving you medication and you are basically left to your own devices, there were only three group therapy sessions a day and everyone was there, mostly men and.. they were all really old., and, it was scary that i didn't know anyone most people there were not depressed, they were violent <laughter>, so that was pretty scary, and i.., it was really hard for me <laughter>, i was as depressed for as a month, i stopped going to my classes and working and i told my teachers lies, about being sick and i just called sick to work, i dropped a class and i failed my classes and didn't turn in any work and, i haven't spoken to any of my friends and, i was, drink much and faint and vomiting everywhere and, i was just in a really bad place., and when i finally tried to kill myself, i realized i needed help., it was, um, i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager, and then i tried to kill myself, and i was put into therapy for some time, so, i thought i didn't want to go down., again this bad way, i just want to get better, so i had to do it i had to get help, i go once a week, i feel like you have the right therapist., it's really useful, i had a therapist i really liked, and i thought we could have gone really far, but, unfortunately, she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles, so i have to, i have to deal with this new therapist, and she's fine., she is not, we are not going to sleep, so great together, but she's the one i've had right now, it's better than nothing <laughter>, not so easy at all, um, since <yawn>, i came out of the hospital and started, and i started taking medication for my depression, i um, i just couldn't sleep well., sleeping is hard to stay <laughter> sleeping is hard, have really, crazy vibrant dreams, who wake me up and disturb me, um, i just guess, sometimes they reflect, things i'm worried about, or happens in my life, but they are just, they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mother how we were here, we did that did this really happen, and it's usually not you dreaming that, sometimes i get so scared i like to talk in sleep and wake myself up, probably <laughter> like two nights ago, this is a, hard question, i think, november <yawn>, after i got out of the hospital, i finally had a good day, and my friend took me with him., downtown chicago, and we went to the sailor's tower, and must look, about the like big windows you go out and see the city, and that was really cool, <laughter>, super starting, he likes to be at the center of attention, funny and a little crazy, i'm not trying to regret things in my life, oh, um, i would say that, life is worth it, and don't be afraid to ask for help, if you need it, don't wait until it gets really bad, i guess my ideal weekend would be <laughter>, sleep and then, catching a movie with my friends, maybe go home with them and, bake some biscuits <laughter> eat all cookies, watch some t v have a sleep over, and then how to make pancakes in the morning, and see more movies we see a lot of movies i would like to do that <laughter> in my spare time, go for a walk i don't know, go to the beach <laughter>, that's a difficult question., i mean, i think i have, i've done a lot of great things in my life., and, i've achieved a lot, but, i think one of the proudest things, proud moments in my life is something really small and insignificant, i did this training boat camp and, the last person who crossed the finish line had to like, thirty push ups and, it was a guy i didn't really know him at all and the coach said that someone wants to help him, if someone helps him, you have to do half everyone, and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start with him to make push ups, and i just, it wasn't because i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good that i did it., and no one really knows about it, but it's just me feeling really good about it, it was nice., it meets you <laughter> bye",16
464,"<sync>, mhm, um i'm doing good what about you, mhm, um, l_a <l> los los angeles but, i currently reside <res>reside in inglewood, wait did i answer your question, i don't know, okay, l_a, um, the murals, the ocean, what else, the people, my family's over here so, that's the best part, what about you, oh wait yeah <laughter>, um, i would say, the smog, yeah the air it could be cleaner, and, yeah, um, that's pretty <pre> i mean, there's good people and bad people too, but yeah for the most part it's all good, um yeah i've been to mexico <me> uh mexico and the temples, and northern california so yes, traveling, like cleaner air that's good it's healthier for your body, cleaner bloodflow, the um people, culture, and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends, yeah um any time, like right now, or when, okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples, and um it started raining, so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go, the the smaller the steps get, so, like people back then had, uh smaller feet, so what happened was, as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways, so my feet could measure up to the the the steps, but once you get up there it's a nice view, i yeah, uh general education but, um mainly art, yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes, um well, when i was a kid, i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so, i just pursued it, so, yeah, my dream job, would be to get paid for painting, painting art, yeah, um, yeah, pretty simple, um, it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion, um, persistence, and faith and will, you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed, mhm, i consider myself to be shy in certain um, time and places, but i am also out outgoing when, like i have the energy, so, i feel like it's well balanced you know, like i'm shy when it's, i guess, okay to be shy, you know, and i'm outgoing when, like the need to actually, um have fun or just explore, it feels good like, if that makes sense but yeah, <laughter>, yeah, to uh relax, um, either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter>, so that helps, and, i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax, you know especially when i use the color blue, because the color blue um relaxes me, and also green, when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down, yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah, my temper, um well my thoughts, my thoughts control my emotions, and my emotions, yeah that's pretty much how, my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad, or if i do get mad what will be the outcome, you know, so, controlling my temper is just, by training my thought, um <sigh>, the last time i argued with somebody, was with my with my father, and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine, so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no, so that kinda frustrated me, and, the way i handled it was like well, i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so, you know, and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace, so, yeah, my family, um it's pretty good, um, my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married, and my brothers and sisters, um we help one another out, so that's good it's just, yeah it's like a team, a situation i wish i could handle differently would be, hmm, that's a good question, i mean, can i get a scenerio, okay, um, a situation i could handle differently, well see that's the thing like i feel like, if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out, you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube, maybe, how would i handle the situation would be just by, uh failing um failing making mistakes, because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after, so, that's the best way i could answer your question, you know, yeah, a positive influence, pretty much, anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence influence you know, like, yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt, well they're not trying to be mean they're actually, good influences so i would say my friends, uh my mom my dad, my brother my sisters, yeah, mm, well see that's the thing like, you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife, but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware, and, it taught me how to read people a little bit more like, just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like, scar me, it did prepare me for like, the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like, you know like guns knives and all that stuff so, it's it's bad but it's good in the long term, you know because, if you get out of that slump, it's like, nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know, and, so yeah, the hardest, um, man, this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it, but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing, life changing, whether to continue school, college, or not, mm i kinda chose, to like, i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like, like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in, so that was a hard choice because there was no, um guarantee that i would, like, run into like the right people, but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so, yeah, yeah, yeah, um it's actually really easy, i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know, i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down, like like slow down my air pattern, yeah, mhm, lately, i've been feeling, good, i've been feeling like i have free will, like at this point in time i feel like, if i chose a path any path, with like, my heart, i could, get there you know, but i'm kind of like, still deciding it's like everything in all all these paths are in the air, just trying to make my own i don't know, that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will, so yeah, lately like in the past two weeks or today, <laughter>, okay, uh yeah you know like, um, yeah, things happen that would change like, my feelings and, for example right now it just happened, huh, for right now like, this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought, because, yeah it's like, it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far, like, one could take a thought, and then make it, reality, so that's kinda like shifting my thoughts right now, this experience this this whole experience, yeah, uh post traumatic stress disorder, no, depression i know how it's like to be depressed, but diagnosed by a doctor no, uh depression, how, how it feels, how does depression feel like, it feels like, it's like a bird in a cage, being depression is like, being <ss> a fish who can't swim in the water, i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings, um, pretty much it feels, like you're limited, but then the thing is, to get out of that depression, it's like you have to, awaken and change your perspective, and focus on, like i i would say colors colors help, and people talking to people helps, yeah, um being depressed, mm let's see, mm, i don't know, like, it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses, so, like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed, but then what happened i fixed it like, called up a friend and, met up with him and yeah, um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know, i'm talking to a virtual person it's pretty cool, and, yeah, right now i feel happy, <laughter>, um, sometimes hard headed, like he would try to teach me um, a certain lesson whether it's art, or just like in my character, and, yeah he would probably just describe me as like, like, like, he would listen, but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do, so pretty much like, i don't know, yeah i mean that's what he tells me, but yeah overall good person, um probably just exercise, um my diet food, my food intake, and yeah just exercise, pretty much it, my health, mm, i would say when i was like in middle school, or, in elementary, a little bit of high school too, but what it would, yeah what it would be was it would either be about, um, well pretty much my art <laughter>, like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like, like trash, and then i'd be like oh, damn, either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it, or what i would do back then would be like damn you know, just kinda dwell on that thought, and then just like, stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it, but yeah, usually it's um people's words, and ideas, that, yeah, yeah so that's it, regret, um yeah i got a couple things i regret, like what, well, sometimes i feel like i should've completed a whole university thing, but, i mean at the same time i feel like, if i really wanted to go, i would have gone, so yeah, that's kind of a regret in my head, ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual, well being, you know, learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i would teach myself, um, pick the right <r> people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment, uh certain events you would experience, and as far as your overall happiness, yeah, yeah among other things but yeah, what i'm most proud of right now, is my paintings, yeah, i'm proud of that because like, i feel like these paintings i'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate, you know it's like it's one of a kind and like it's it's there you know, it's has own signature so, so yeah i'm i'm pretty happy about that, yeah thank you, alright thank you, mhm, alright bye, <laughter>",0
345,"hi, yeah i'm okay , i'm doing great , yeah , um i am from los angeles i was born in santa monica, yeah, um, i like um , i don't know there's nothing i mean i don't really like it here that much

school right now um yeah i'm just at home <laughter> , my dream job would be um, i would like to help other people as long as it's something helping other people uh i would like to help other people with like p_t_s_d and problems and stuff uh, yeah just as long as i'm you know helping other people smile and you know relating my problems with other people , um i'm pretty <pr> i'm close well i'm really close with my grandma um, eh my family it's just eh we're not like too too close we kinda argue a lot <laughter>, yeah , um sorry what's an introvert , okay , when i'm annoyed um, well i try to

temper um i need some help on that <laughter> , um no not really i mean no i guess it's not like as bad as like most people i've never like been in a fight or anything or yeah any of that , um i argued with my mom and sister yesterday it was just something stupid over like, my sister is sitting was sitting in the front seat and she's a kid and it's like i'm i should be in the front seat so i just asked her to sit in the back and of course they start like yelling and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter> , yeah it does, thanks , my grandma she's always giving me encouragement and um she's a therapist a licensed therapist so she's always you know made it really really um , easy for me to have someone to talk to and i could always go to her, so that helps yeah , yeah , my most memorable experiences well i had one really good experience um i went horseback riding and that was really really made me happy, uh i love horses and nature that's the biggest thing that i love and it just made me so happy and so relaxed so that was a memorable experience <laughter> , um caring, very caring always there to talk to um i don't judge i never judge i'm never cranky i'm never i

it's it's really hard um , i don't usually sleep well so um, yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly , um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories, um just you know, thinking too much <laughter>, um i don't know um i think just uh , stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it <laughter> , um i just try to stay positive i try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better, um , i just i try to call somebody and talk to them if i have trouble like my grandma , yeah , thanks, when i don't sleep well um well i start to like cry a lot and i start to get really irritable, um i get really depressed it makes me not feel well at all i get very uh it just is really really bad if i don't get sleep yeah , yeah , thanks, yes, i was diagnosed um three years ago , uh i just i didn't really know what was going on then i realized okay well they just diagnosed that and um, i was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that , yeah , yeah it's hard , um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um, i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i, um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah , oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so i'm trying to walk more that helps , thanks, um yeah i have depression um yeah , um it helps yeah it actually does help me a lot um i currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's kind of a mix-up but yeah it really really helps me , um i noticed that i've had less flashbacks and um, i've been more relaxed i guess and um, yeah just you know trying to keep more occupied yeah it helps , um the last time i felt really happy um, i guess um, i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter> , um most proud of uh, well <sigh> um, i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um , i , think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like, you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help, but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um, they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that , oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um, i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um, a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that , wow um i would've told myself to, um, i guess the advice i would've given myself was to , try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess, yeah, um, well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but, i just try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better , for fun um i like to go to the mall that's a lot fun i like to go to the mall i like to go out with my

362,"yes, good, from california, i like the art and entertainment i like anyway, the, you have a lot of freedom to work in many different areas around, i like the fact that the weather is great around i like the fact that all my roots are here all my family is here, i don't like it., how hard it is, places more it is very difficult there is so much traffic it takes a long time to get where you go around it is expensive, it is much more expensive than it used to be, not more, i studied journalism english music and special effects make up, i'm, now i run a doggy day care facility, it's my dream job,, own my own company again, probably working with animals, no, i'm an artist i draw i paint i do tattoos, i work a lot with animals, i like outdoor activities cycling hiking, people who are not just people, who, angry and for people who are dishonest, usually i will give myself like a second timeout and think about it before i speak or react, i'm very good at controlling my temperament, probably my spouse has something to do with our financial affairs., i am very close to my children and my father, , no, it's never easy, it's the hardest job in the world, but it's the best, just.., you want to prevent your children from making the mistakes you had, but you realize that they have to do that., just to learn how to live life is one of the most difficult things to let them make their own mistakes., the unconditional love my boys have for me,, everything a parent has made me a better person, it has made me a better all that a better employee around me has, i think having my kids made me, much better person every day, i probably have a lot i had a very full life, i would be really hard to say that i have so many, i'm a good friend i'm a true friend i'm honest i'm real, i'm reliable., and i'm not playing games i'm very i'm not a drama, no, yes, i have, in order, february of two thousand eleven, i was attacked by a stalker and almost killed in november of two thousand nine he broke into my apartment and lay waiting for me and attacked me when i came into the door and tried to kill myself, i know., i think therapy has helped me enormously, i don't think i would be able to keep a job and be responsible and, be , a productive member of society <s> of society without therapy, i'm able to handle things better i'm not getting so emotionally excited about much more rational i'm trying to stay more rational than emotionally rational and logical, so i was sick and i was a little stressed, i've got it., i use the resources <res> and use the resources i've learned and grab other people i'm not trying to isolate., i'm trying to.., use the tools given to me in therapy to, i don't use drugs anymore, so it's mostly proactive treatment where i have to do something about it., it's not it's never easy it's always bad, tired lethargic, it's hard to keep my thoughts around it's hard to just do the basics during the day, mm no, i can't remember, oh i went to the beach with my oldest son and his best friend and we drove three real tricycle bikes and that was a lot of fun, it's hard to say right now i haven't decided that i'm very proud of my kids i'd say it's likely that they're really good guys, i have too many regrets at the moment, to finish school, to the, stay focused to not, let me be distracted, focus more on long term objectives than on short term objectives, my father, i'm very honest, i'm very calm, i don't get angry easily, it takes a lot to provoke me., i'm reliable when i say i do something i do., and i'm not i'm basically what you see is what you get, i don't hit people, to do everything with animals i love animals i always smile around animals every kind big small, i like older people older people i like to help them and be around them, i like kids, um",20
487,", yes, i'm fine, thank you., detroit michigan, yes, i moved to ia in two thousand and seven, but my family came here., many years ago more than forty years ago, i'm not going back to detroit., i really don't like the weather and i have no reason for most of my immediate family is out here, in california and, uh totally different around, for me was detroit just very cold it wasn't, the best for my personality i prefer l a more space, a warmer climate warmer people, only one other, different uh vibe, that i like better, after my husband and i ended relationship, i had family out here, so i thought it would be easier, to start here from the beginning, as some of the other places i had lived, or stay where we were at, extremely easy i came to visit here every year while i was in college so i was extremely used to it, plus i had also, taken out of school by six months and lived out here, and went to school out here, so i was totally used to it, well, like i said, the weather is number one it's just uh, less crowded it is more free space it is a, a quieter friendly atmosphere, less hurry, the smog would be one., and when i drive the traffic, in certain areas it may be, but, um, in general, there's not much i don't like < l> it's, as i think, the general threat to the earthquake, but that's, is not really such a factor because it rarely happens, the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one i don't necessarily like, i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all, so, i don't travel as much as i used to., but i've travelled all over the world, new experiences, well, i used to be an international flight attendant and then i traveled later, through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so, i have visited many different places and, i have to say it was them., all quite a lot of fun because you know there are different cultures to learn to see different things, enjoying experience, my experiences i would say in order, i visited europe more than that i also visited, uh in south south america i guess because the cultures are so very different, i would probably say rather shy around in general, in comparison to people i know are really very outgoing, but also, i let them describe me as starting, i like to read i like to walk or go electricity or walk, listening to music you know, i'm very good at controlling my temperament, oh, probably when i was, married to my husband many years ago, there could be many things i don't even know in specific, but just everything in general quite a lot could get into a debate slash argument with him, it could be a choice., uh, some of the cases if i could have been with him and i, you know it got emotional, or, let me bother him that he's such a big deal of something, instead of, um, you know you saw it., not reacting something, maybe, but it would always be, we were also urged to respond like this, you know you can't always say that you can ignore a person there, because it's often just about ignoring the situation and it doesn't escalate., but some people, you know you're not responding to the so called norm., if you ignore it, they'll only know they're escalating, but that's not always the case., i taught middle school children and you can try to rest, to use methods with them, but that doesn't always work, but you always have to take care of how the teacher, you know your professional behavior so that you don't really, even if they know that the children do something outrageous or potentially dangerous for themselves or other children., well, that could be, several, mm, i guess it's a decision in.., together with my mother decide to let a relative have surgery, uh, that you know that the result was uncertain, it could go either way, and in this case she died so, you know, it's a pretty tough decision because you don't know, but you also know if it couldn't be very serious., results also for them, mhm, oh many different things that could happen, you know in life that you are always second guess, things you might be able to do, but, they can also be learning experiences, so it is necessarily a good thing,, delete them you know if, they can see it as positive, sometimes people can have a, strong reaction and they don't really stop by, uh impact of the event, because there could be something that, you can choose from that, but there i grew up in a house of, dysfunction so there was, just domestic abuse you know and.., there have been many cases, so you can't just say one thing because there are many traumatic things., but it would also have been a different outcome if one had learned to deal with some things., who appear as adults in life,, sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends who, had not really strong experiences, fall apart or just have very difficult times to deal with,, you can listen that you know that you and i, because i understand that not everyone has the same experience you know., go through them, levels of, understanding and you know,, how you know someone, they have a balance of background information on, which will help them undress and see that you know that things will, progress in a better way know that this is not like, the end of the world or as terrible as it seems it could be, and you can also tell other experiences with them, of things that were worse, or, you know, seem to be, and of course there is always in general i mean, when you look at all the misfortunes of the world, you know that most of these things don't affect, we or the people we know here, , so that, perspective, which, you know that you're someone from her, i won't necessarily say self absorption, but the apparently, intensity of her experience at the moment, now we have a good relationship with her, anyway in most cases there are different levels of, to stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced, so it has, made them interact with life and people you know more than others, some have not been having, so much, experience in life that helps them to deal with things you know in a different way, so it keeps evolving, and i, go into positivity as a trace of, you know how i react to trying to testify., a more positive, answer from them, instead of feed, sometimes the, very strong reactions or reactions or interactions that they may have, excuse me., i didn't hear you repeat it., my mother different teachers friends, well, my mother has always been a very calm, around person for the most part reckless, although she has experienced a lot, negativity i had teachers who were around, very., positive <po> positive and proactive, and have learned to think independently and, techniques to learn about some of the things that, it occurred, and only different friends you know that i would see the company, situations sometimes much more difficult you know how to deal with things so, most of the time, it's important that you know it pretty well., it depends on whether i'm dealing with a lot of things or study, or, you know., i'm trying to get more hours a day because i have to do things, then you know it's less, but, um, in general i have no problem sleeping, it's only if i let myself stay awake because there are more things i want to do, i have the feeling that okay uh less you know stressful in it generally goes because i have several projects that i work on so, but generally good, for example , i mean,, not particularly, i mean, i just seem, um, less stressful as i get more things done i just get and the stress comes from sometimes there are a lot more things to do, in a shorter period, but, you know how to reorganize, some of the, things that need to be done, you know you can smooth this out., no, i didn't, but i know it's something that, a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people, i have not been going on, well, there are several i think about, and happiness comes in, small or big things, but generally every day <d> every day every moment for me i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning, is big, wonderful, you know the day of happiness around, as far as large, festive types of things i don't have great ups and downs like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum, you know, every day it can be a really great food it could be a great view it could be, you know a moment you shared with someone you know., it should be a straight on a straight keel, um, as uh uh, persistent, you know i will., continue and, and, positive, excited, um, maybe not to do, things different when i was younger than spending my money differently or, or mine, time you know a little more differently, but, that's hard to say, it's like okay, how your getting older you can see, you know you could have done some things differently., instead of buying, the house i did, i would have told you that you waited and bought another, i mean things like that., i would have.., made me california earlier and i'm, i would have.., instead of buying the house that i would have bought if i knew that i was, if you knew what kind of situation i'm in right now, wait to get something else, but you know how to, you know that in retrospect you make the best decision you can at the time, available with the best information <in> information, you know after you've looked at several options, from to, be present, independent and formed able,, take care of me., all right., goodbye.",0
337,"yeah, that's good., i'm fine., how are you?, i am originally from a suburb of l a from the san gabriel valley, i like the variety i like the atmosphere of the city i have lived other places and it's just, not, as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here, so i like l a, like all the things that are so close together, then there are a lot of interesting things that are completely different parts of the city only miles from each other, uh, may not like the traffic all cars but i can live with it i mean, there's not so much i don't like, i studied music for vocal performance i studied music technology things like, yes, i'm singing in an opera company, but i have a day job because it doesn't pay so much if you don't work for the opera., so i have a day job that i work in a call center that mainly works on, actors and actors and such things and it's really good, because when i get a call, i can call and change my shift very easily., so it's actually a pretty good gig, and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know there's some recording some live sound thing, but i'm kind of wanting to get away from the, do some video work sometimes, but again i want to go away from that i want to go back to the, because i find that more performance is more interesting i like talent more than i like crew <laughter>, so somehow i want to get away from this side and start working more towards actually doing what i want to do with my life, sometimes i mean by my personal life yeah so i have a bowl that i get out there to deal with people, but when i'm home, you know, i'd rather think of myself or my husband or my cats or talk to the family., you don't really have too many close friends < clears throat> but yeah you know, i'd rather stay with me., mediocrely close to the family i've left, i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so, but how, thanks <laughter> but how uh my i'm close to my husband and, you know, i have some cousins i'm talking to, and my aunt i have an aunt with who i'm talking to a little bit, but it's not like we interact close by every day., but it's, a little short, mostly i sing or read or write or, only, hang and try, clarifies my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work, but i try to do that and try to just, make everything clear and see what comes back in, and, sometimes <ss> sometimes that sometimes it doesn't work, but mostly to create things, to contact my family, some <so> you know about facebook or whatever, works, but, mostly in my spare time i create things, i would like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot around, i mean, my idea of, like a birthday party, going on a road trip, and i like to travel around more, i would love to travel for work things or whatever, but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to travel, see <see> uh especially traveling by car seeing how the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know how to change the vibrations of the region feel, i like to see what's out there and i know that there's a bigger world outside of, where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see this, but i like to leave this and go back to my own world <laughter>, <laughter> < empties the throat> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <l, um, let's see., a trip i like to take is to take the trip from here to nevada, whether i go all the way to vegas or just go state line, around my cousin and i would take what we call, leave a ride because once you reach the first exit of a highway, you are either in another state or you are at the end of the highway, so we would take the only, type of improvisation with how <li> a day or two notes just move things around just stand out, so these are actually trips i like to make because i take off and then sometimes on the same day sometimes overnight, only small short trips, which, are not very involved, but you can just walk and see things and see how, to you know the desert landscape looks at different seasons, how people react at different times of the year in different areas, so close to home, but not, but not close to home near home, but uh still a world away, so because i don't really take time like a two week vacation or whatever, but these are just small things that, somehow things back in perspective and and my head and things like that clear, i mean because there's a kind of feeling of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't drive on a highway, so i like to do that, the last time that happened was may of last year, that was the last time i could do that, we actually came my aunt with my cousin who is ten years younger than i am, and we grew up kind of like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland kingdom where they live, so they took me to one last hurrah and we drove up to vegas, and looked around and came back because i actually lived in vegas for a while, but i didn't like it, so she kind of, i showed them some of the local websites around there, and we came back and were, you know, an overnight stay, but we were driving like this all the time <laughter>, it was kind of an interesting, things that are by nature unfair when people are mean to older people, children or animals, people who cannot fight back, and they are mean to them just because they can't fight back, and, i'm actually.., how to see people who are, strong <st> as strong as the people who want to stand up and be an advocate, or what's wrong with you?, so i think this is one thing that really makes me angry just being cruel or mean for no reason, you don't know people for people who can't fight back, or for people who didn't do anything to earn it., just that somehow really drives me crazy, if i am angry, i will try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me, then i will somehow end lasching out either, you know, orally, just, cut it with a quip or, you know, i mean, i'm rarely gonna yell at anyone, but i'm trying to tell you., if i try to go away and defuse it if it doesn't work, then i let them know that they're annoying me and coming away from me <laughter> that usually works, not in like legal problems or so, because normally i will find a way to, i want you to leave me alone., um, so there aren't really big problems, but because i think it's because it's gone putting and it's not expected < exp> the expected reaction, and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because i know that's gonna work and get people away from me, so it's not really in trouble and if, it's trouble, it's usually trouble,, it's from the perspective of the other person and it doesn't affect me at all, because it's usually a situation i can get out of., as long as they leave me alone, you know, i'm not leaving., last time i was fighting with someone., for example , person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or someone not in my, the last thing i can think about was, i, quarreling with my husband about the care of my mother in law because she has dementia, and if we were one of the reasons we came here from the inland kingdom, we were to take care of her, because she's not going anywhere, except l a, i mean, she's like hardcore angelino as you know we know we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live somewhere else, but we came here to take care of them., and he wants her to stay in her apartment, and i want her to move in with us., because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she were to live with us, but she wants to stay where she is because she cannot see that there is now inherent danger due to the disease process, but he wants her to stay where she's supposed to be, that she's able to have what she wants, because he's a mama boy like, i'm a mama girl, although i lost my mother, like four years ago, i'm still a mama girl and i'm still going to be <st> and i'm still and i know that, it, brings you, a feeling of satisfaction to fulfill their wishes because you care so much about them and that's what they want, so you want to get it for them and because you know that they know that this has happened to you, when you grew up trying to give you what you want because you wanted to., and you want to do that for them now, like a way to give them back someone you care about someone you feel you deserve., but it's kind of dangerous for her, and i don't want anything to happen to her., but i want her to stay, who she is, as long as she can, because i know how to erase the disease that she has, who she is, after all,, and finally she has to be taken to a place where she can give her twenty four hours of medically trained care, but until then, we can deal with you knowing it between us because it's not that bad., but it comes where she really shouldn't live anymore <shou>, so the solution now is he stays there most of the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do, i handle the outer things that i lead the errands i bring them to the store things like that he makes the day to day things make sure she has <ha>she eats makes sure that they know that clean clothes things like the, so i mean, it's a partnership, it's a partnership, it's a partnership., a double effort it is very much a double effort, but i want her to move in with us, so it was like, a source of it is not really like screaming screaming argument, but, lively discussion <laughter>, you know as a debate, meh, it's not insurmountable, i mean, life will never be easy., and if that's what it is, then you should be worried, because someone can pull the carpet out under you., as long as you're above everything and present in your life, it won't be easy., but you deal with it and you keep moving, uh the most positive influence i believe were probably my mother and grandmother, because my mother was pretty much a single mother and my grandmother helped raise me and she actually, gave me a lot of trust, and were realistic about it, so i mean, i think i have some kind of, realistic kind of downer temperament for me, but they helped me see that it's just inside me and it's not something i can't get over, and that you know life goes on, you know my mom would say to me if you were 40, you're 40, whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life., and i think that was a big influence on how i lived, how i lived my life since she died, i regret that i did not take care of myself in my mother's last year of life because i think it has clouded some of my decisions., now i have underlying conditions and everyone in my family is diabetic and i didn't care when she was the last year of her life because i was too busy getting her home, i wanted to take her home., so i didn't eat properly, i didn't take my insulin properly, i made myself insulin resistant that this year just because my blood sugar was as high as a year, eating only terrible food when i ate, so it really took a toll and i really got very sick, and i wonder well if i don't, if i had taken care of myself and had my head completely straight and my vision and thoughts were not complete, were not clouded, i would have made better decisions on her behalf, especially if she needed them., and when she needed me to step in and make the decisions for her because she, she had a health disaster because she had a kidney, and she had kidney damage that led to kidney failure., your health insurance provider misses that, so she ended up with, such a kind of this whole thing, disaster where everything began to break at once, she had a stroke like a fifties, which she had a small stroke., and it just went down from there, so i think well, if i hadn't, if i had taken care of a better care of myself, i would have been able to take better care of her, and i know, there was nothing i would have been able to prevent her death, but what if i had been able to make it easier for her, if i'd taken care of myself and that's like a great regret i've had, oh, i know i'm <laughter> but it's, my desire to take responsibility, for everyone and everything that matters to me to take responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really do, to direct them into my own vision because they are their own, individuals, and they do not know, be what i want them to be and i know they won't be, but i still have you know my ideals, and i want the way that i want everything to go and i want everyone who is important to me to be happy and also to be able to, fits into my life, in a way in the best possible way, but i know because they are other beings, and i know i won't be able to do that for them, and they won't be able to do that for me, but it's still my ideals, so sometimes i have to look at it and go well, is what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually their, and i know it's theirs, so if you really care about someone, you're just gonna support them and go with them, but.., it's still, kind of hard <laughter> for me and i know i have to get through it, um, ten or twenty years ago, probably to be in the beginning of my own life because i wound up around my mother i mean her, became sick literally the weekend i finished in college <laughter> and i had a job set up and i had to pull out of it because she needed me to take care of her, and i think i would have been more aggressive if i had started my own life getting a job out there., the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like this built up instead of just completely her daughter for about ten years, so, i think i probably would have done that., but i'm telling myself that you keep who you are and learn to separate., you are who you are and what you have to do for your family, to keep a feeling of yourself that is probably what i would have done and do things for myself to keep that feeling of myself that is probably the supply of what i would give myself, ten years ago <laughter>, no, but probably because i didn't go to the doctor because i don't want to know., and i mean, it's not, i know there were times in my life when i was very depressed and it's usually circumstances., and had to pull me out of her, but i'd rather pull myself out of her before i resort to treatment., and it gets <ge>, um, after my mother died, i mean, it had been such a long fight for a year that we had lost and i didn't know it., if i was responsible for logically doing so, i knew it wasn't me., but, how could i convince myself, two weeks after her death, i'm with, pulmonary embolism, in one in each lung because i didn't look at myself for a year and i thought, oh i'm thirty years old when, you know what i'm doing to myself, i can't get over any laughter, but.., i mean, i had to take more medication., because of the, it was a struggle to get my own health back to be able to, to get out of this depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden., the carpet was pulled out my like ground fell out of my world after that so, that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression around i was almost divorced because it was because i just didn't want anything anymore, so, and i was really away from my husband, until that time we were married for about two years at this point and i started very far away from him just pushing everything away just, you know what i'm gonna do with the rest of my life., and it, it's already, a fight you know, you mean there are times when i couldn't get up., just stay in bed and sleep all day you know., but then, to recognize that , when my mother died, i had four cats to watch for two, my two are her and so i adopted the two who were her, i mean good, they have no choice if they can buy their own food and buy their own food., i took the responsibility to do it for them., so that was a motivating factor that they had no choice whether i would get up or not and take care of them, i mean, i could go without eating, i could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't, they didn't know., they actually have me up and, and let me go and face things, even if i didn't want to, not only didn't just want to somehow lure and die, but that wouldn't have been my choice and they i mean what would happen to them, if i wasn't there to take care of her, they'd be, you know sent to a shelter or whatever likely, and maybe they wouldn't have taken me back and adopted me from someone else, maybe they'd have been killed., for me i mean to make selfish decisions for me, so it's like i need someone to take care of me to get me out of bed <laughter> and that was actually a motivating factor, because i found out that if it were just me, i would be able to live without a lot of stuff, i mean, i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it not to be a big deal i don't care, as long as i did what i wanted to do with my life, but, i need to take care of a family., so i have to get out and do things, you know, i need to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day you know, day job i need to know you,, but i'm trying to find a balance between the two, because that's what i want to do with my life, but still i have to take care of my family, so i'm, work on a balance between the two, very <laughter> but it's worth it, i mean,, it would be very i would have much less things to worry about if i only lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>, but keep, a residence below pay bills things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it, you know, if you want something <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through it, and i and i know that, but, it's gonna be hard sometimes you want to give up, but then, it's how good what the alternative is, i mean, i don't think i could live a pleasant life., because if i did, i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be something uncomfortable or i won't do anything to myself i'll just be, be happy to just stay in bed all day, hang out with my cats or whatever, and i wouldn't do anything, very, scary and nervous and i mean what if, i can't find it., enough you know enough work to pay my rent or whatever if.., you know what if i can't?, to keep, a similarity of stability in my life and it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable, but, what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs, and i don't think it's things that didn't happen and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that didn't happen and i know that, but it still happens <ha> it's still crawling in, so this is actually, a source for, anxiety, but then try to let the fear go by doing things by finding out the things that make a solid plan and go after it., but i know it's a cycle, and i'll assume to be really scared and oh my god, what am i going to do, what am i going to do to say okay what is, the basic thing i have to take from here, i mean what <wha> what is only foreign and what can <c> what can what, is what are the actual non problems and what is the real problem, and so, figure out how to do things this way and then the fear starts to disappear a little bit, but then something will pop up and what will pop up again, mm i have to, uh , find out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know what seems huge on the surface when you start hacking it away, you get over it pretty fast, you get through., the last time i felt really happy, i don't know., zz, um, i , huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually really <ac> that actually surprisingly dull me, because sometimes i feel happy sometimes not so much sometimes just kind of, in the middle, um, really how happy happy i don't know, i can't imagine when this happened., i don't know you don't know., i mean perceptions of other people, probably as someone who, strangely enough, someone who is left behind and you know,, treats things as they come, but i don't see myself like this, in general, and it's a, probably that i can think on my feet and, i'm not afraid., huss my ass away and do whatever i need to survive and do things, to do this., and i can make it creative and i try,, search for balance, likely, probably the best things about me <laughter>, that i basically do what i want with my life, although it's not all easy it's not, um, you know, i'm not financially good or what it's still a lot more than many people can say about their lives because i have an aunt i really don't talk to, who and the reason i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable, i mean, she's got, a career that they, it's more like a job she fell into, because my older aunt loves animals, but she didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog nurse., and she was really good at it she had a stable business for a long time, but her hands <ha> know that she began to get arthritis in her hands and, she had.. my cousin's father.., stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business, and she retired early because she retired early between that and arthritis., she occupied my younger aunt, who was still a dog nurse, but she hates it, and it's like you're changing your life so much when you change your life., and the thing i'm most proud of is, yeah, i'm not as financially good at what she is, but i do what i want with my life you know i can, being creative i can have creative people around me that i really like to talk to around me, people i really like in my life and, to be satisfied with, and i see a lot of people who don't, and it gives me a feeling of maybe a bloated feeling of complacency to be able to say i'm not so, and i actually do what i want, although there are victims i still basically do what i want with my life now, thank you very much <laughter>, all right., thank you very much <laughter>, goodbye.",10
440,"<sync>, yes, i'm okay thank you, um i was born in east los angeles, and, yes, um the freedom to explore outdoors, and with different um, weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat>, temperature, and climates to go skiing or, to the beach maybe in the same day, i like that, um, mm i think probably the overcrowding, um and the smog, mm not not frequently but i have, meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures, sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy, and um, that was my second time being there, and, i enjoyed it more this time, because, um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um, and i was better prepared, for, italians and their culture i felt, i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought, for that trip, um <clears throat>, that would be, um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house, in the midst of, acres and acres and acres of grapes was just, magnificent, um human development, um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i, started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant, and um i went to a program, in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant, and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss, i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly, and um so the college offered, human development as a major, and i um, just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired, towards that particular major and, and i'm happy with it, um currently no i stay at home i have a little one, uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work, um, in the meantime i design jewelry, well i have three, children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children, seventeen and twenty three, no, um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional, all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time, for every age <laughter>, and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages, so, um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages, that's why it makes me crazy, um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents, it was just kinda like, you know is she fed is she dressed, she has a house i mean a roof over her head, and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so, it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of, that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age, every year month, you know <clears throat> and um, so i think it difference differs in that way, tremendously, very close, <clears throat>, outgoing, mm, i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited, i, feel a little, you know, confident to talk to people, i probably talk, more than i need to <laughter>, um <clears throat> i bead, i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax, i'm pretty good i i, well i think i um, try not to, not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are, when i'm upset, um which is not good, 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out, and um, yeah that, that's uh something i have to work on, like exercising or something, um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about, um, he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage, on him, uh really tired of talking about that same topic, um, well it came it spawned from <f> from, a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for, many things, and um <clears throat>, and so he took that information and came home, and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me, think about cheating and, he knows that i've been resentful of him, and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating, <clears throat> and um <sigh>, i we've had this conversation a lot of times, and uh i mean not just that but, i don't know just about cheating in general, and um so i just said what i, normally said normally say is that i haven't, um, cheated and that i, did think about that when we were first together, and uh but it was just a mere thought, and, um, and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another, and that just kinda, <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that, and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again, and why are we having this conversation <laughter>, are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that, that, went into, that um, argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting, um <sigh>, not talking, at all <laughter>, um <sigh>, mm, pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled, because i really don't like, if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because, um i was yelled at, a lot, and i just, feel bad about that and i, try really hard to not, handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get, and result in in yelling, hmm, that would probably be whether to keep, a pregnancy or not, yeah, yeah i um, i was just talking about it yesterday actually, and um, oh i was pregnant and, i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married, and but i just, didn't think that i it was the right time for me, and um, i had, pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy, but i made the decision by myself, and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant, he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me, and so that decision was quite hard, because i felt obligated to do so, and felt super guilty to not, and, <drops microphone> oops, and uh, this is on correctly um, hang on this ear piece is falling, there we go, that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no, i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make, in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um, the hospital should um unplug the life, or um life support machine for my father, or not, that was the hardest decision, um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that, and to have been um, to resort to the situation that he was in, not capable of doing anything at all either speaking, for himself um, was beyond it, who he was and i just couldn't see him, like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told, so i agreed, to um resort that, not, hardly ever, <laughter>, too many things running on my mind um, and pretty much um, mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends, uh even though i, know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about, uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time, but um, and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out, but it's hard, very stressed, mm my son is is um, has been, uh in dealing with some legal issues, and um currently is incarcerated, and uh, it's been really hard, yes i've been probably very short, moody irritable, well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter>, my mind just goes from one, point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there, um you know, it's interesting, uh yeah, no, yes, about three years ago, um my, um o_b_g, suggested i, i uh, see a psychiatrist, yes, well um, i've, in the process of changing therapists so it's been about, because the program that i was in, um, lost funding, and i lost my therapist, or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been, about two months, maybe three now, and um but i did notice when i was in therapy, um that it was just an intricate part of my, my life my week to, see my therapist, um, it really helped me, cope, um, <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um, when he was released, from um, jail, um, a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning, that i'll, i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to, do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know, legally of course, um, outgoing, um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her, um, and, compassionate, sensitive, loyal, mm, all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter>, well yelling the yelling part was one, um, just <j> just the little things that, used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself, doing them and it bothers me a lot, regarding what, mm, <clears throat>, um, not too much really i don't know, <clears throat>, to go to college right after high school, and not wait, um, and <sigh>, that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy, or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and, not in a relationship and still be happy and, live life, um, what did i do, mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good, yeah, i was happy that he was safe, um, my children, and uh, my accomplishments, in um, school and work, bye",19
325,"yes, um, i'm fine, it's a little weird that you're talking to a virtual person., around i was born i was born in l a i was raised in the suburbs around i have lived everywhere i have lived in the valley long beach and now i am in the culver city, um, there's good food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it's not getting cold i don't have to shovel snow, there are many ways a lot of variety all different types of people uh i think this is really great, this is a much longer list i like to get out of here, the traffic i think is number one, i think everyone hates traffic and everyone's so busy, all the time it's really hard to be with someone who's so interested in their job and, uh, we're also in traffic., i just graduated to have studied marine biology, i was i was going to school and i was originally studying graphic design and i found this kind of unfulfilled, so i made a trip for a while traveling around the world and started diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so i came into it, everyone asked me that lately since i graduated, i think i'd like to take a breath., um, i think maybe, management of research, you know, i'm not sure i'd like to., something in tropical marine ecology perhaps like a nature reserve to manage something like the, it is a difficult question to answer <laughter>, i know., um, i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world, now i traveled to central america for eight months, um and i visited a variety of different countries i, i went diving., i think i think intolerance injustice in the world these are probably the things that fire me the most, vent makes my friend that count <laughter>, i'm pretty good, it takes a lot to really get me to the point where i kind of blow my top the very few people who have seen me angry around, up to the point where i scream and scream angry, i don't know that i just don't get there, i think i'm a little afraid of losing my temper, so i keep it under control, it was yesterday when i was arguing with my friend about it,, getting a job, i talked about taking a job somewhere, and he was very supportive and i really wanted him to say no go not take this job for six months because i miss you and he was just supportive so around, we argued about this <laughter> and it was ridiculous, so we laughed at the end and that was the end of the fight, to meditate, go into nature to stay away from the computer, away from technology, away from people., i'd say not really around i'm a single child and it's just me and my parents and we're very dissimilar for example around i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh, couch potatoes that they like to watch reality television, so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do to as far as common activities, so you know i love them and everything, but there's not too much common reason, yeah, i think i'm a very social introvert, but i.., seem to find the most social encounters to empty out where, as my friend for example, he around conducts a lot of joy and energy to people for me it's always a little the opposite that i need to charge, i don't know if i have a best friend, but i guess i'll tell my friend he's kind of my standard best friend., he would probably say passionately intelligent, he always tells me that i'm really hard on me, which is true to be loyal., i think i'm just proud of who i am i don't know if that's the answer most people give, but i think i'm, i'm really proud of who i am i'm trying really hard around i have a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's kind of rare to find people who are friendly and i look at myself, a friendly person who cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so i'm proud of it, < slaughter>, no i didn't, no, yes, i was probably about fifteen at the time, so i think eight was that seventeen years ago, yes, i cut and my, named one of my best friends, to call my parents and let them know and at this point they took me with them for treatment, i wasn't the first time i'd ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before it was more, they thought i had a d h d so much, it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in instead of asking me for help, i haven't stopped for about three years, uh, because it felt like i checked in with a probation officer i just didn't enjoy the relationship i had, but i still have the psychiatrist i'm going to for medical controls, < slaughter>, i think it's useful if you have the right therapist, i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist, it can be incredibly harmful that i have spoken to people who have had bad experiences and will never go back., lately i've been a little down around i should say a little down as usual because i graduated and, my routine to go to school, and make school supplies twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it is a little, strange to find out what to do with mine, to find a way to be productive and to know what to do with my time is also a little bit to, depressive statement that my intelligence and good grades at school do not translate into real world skills and there are not so many jobs for marine biologists in california, almost impossible since i was a little kid, i've had trouble falling asleep and.., about four years ago it really got bad, where i just couldn't sleep through the night i got about four hours of sleep, sometimes i would wake up every hour and i would only wake up a complete wreck in the morning, so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep, you're a virtual person, so you probably didn't see that, but it's pretty much like i, i'm just a panicked, terrified wreck that i'm losing my ability to deal with., i'm losing my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temperaments, i can't regulate my moods, i'm just really volatile, probably a few months ago i think i might have been on a trip away for a weekend and forget to take my medicine with me or something and then i can't sleep and so it's what happens, uh <makes sounds with mouth>, really happy i mean to, i don't know, it's easy for me to keep track of when i feel really bad really happy i think i felt happy on new year's eve, really happy on new year's eve, that was around, ten days ago i was with my friend and some friends and we went on a trip to palmspring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them, i can't see them very often because i was in school and i was so busy, so it was really a nice reintroduction to real life., i think i'm nice, i'm considerate, i'm tolerant, i'm pretty open minded, i'm aware of my mistakes., i'm just trying to be nice to everyone and, i'm very curious about the world and things i don't know that i really like to learn, uh from the top of my head first thing that came to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really, me and my friends we know have jumped off the boat and you come across the edge of this, uh limestone sink hole and it's really blue and you just fall on about forty hundred feet in, something like two minutes, we did it pretty fast not everyone could do it so fast and around when you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge, they're bigger than people and because it's that, cave system and it is really cloudy and there are sharks swimming everywhere around you so, that was pretty good <laughter>, i try to remember that i haven't had much free time in the last three and a half years when i was in school around <laughter> so i guess reading hiking around, i'm just dating my friends., relatively low key things going in movies with dinner parties cooking with my cat playing, not that i can really think about it, i'm sure i made mistakes in my life, but you know i'm still here, so i can't be that bad, hmm, um, i don't know if you're holding on to your clothes, 'cause the '90s are back in fashion., hmm, to be cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets in around outside in nature, type of away from the hub of the city get a good note <laughter>, i think my friend just gave it up, especially last year, he really inspired me that he stopped drinking he stopped smoking he's, he really inspired me that he stopped drinking, he made many positive changes in his life and i know these things aren't difficult or not easy, i should say to <t> to see someone overcome such a thing that, i was really inspired., all right.",10
445,"<synch>, yes, i feel great, i am from los angeles california, um the weather, the opportunity, and the ocean, it's overcrowded, overpriced, and somewhat dirty, i have, well it's nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures, i worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer, and traveled to alaska the aleutian islands, korea japan, and the caribbean islands, um, being in galena alaska and being on a small airplane, and traveling in a snow storm, and surviving, like i was on the edge of death and life but i lived, the arts and business, i don't know i was attracted to the arts at a young age, and business went along with it, yes, yes, to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life, more outgoing, um, i always feel <fee> i feel very confident with my thoughts, and i like people to know what i have to say, um i listen to music, and i sit with my girlfriend, and she calms me down when i'm stressed out, i could work on that i'm not very good at that, last night, with my girlfriend, she was asking my advice on something and, as i was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud i was not angry, but i was irritated that i was being told to quiet down when i didn't really wanna help i just wanted to relax, <laughter> i agree, um, sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset, and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings, and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal, it's been very difficult but i'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier, well when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of c_o_p_d and then it turned into lung cancer, i chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful, and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but i couldn't tell her the truth, and i let her think that everything was okay, it was, uh, my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline, that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better, oh i don't know i try to uh, be grateful i'm alive and try to focus on my own objectives, and not dwell on the negative things of my memory, my girlfriend she's a very good positive <po> positive influence she wants me to be a better person, she since i met her she's been trying to make me not be angry, to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positive zen-like man so, what she's asking for is something that's gonna make me improve therefore i must capitulate, it's very easy, i sleep well, sometimes i wake up when i have nightmares about my mother or something but uh i go back to sleep, that's unknown i don't know, it just happens, i've been feeling uh good, eh the my reality is i've been hit with a lot of financial, uh problems but i'm handling <ha> handling them well actually, i've been looking at it as my girlfriend has told me that i need to do this so therefore it is on the forefront of my mind right now, no, no, today, when i woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and i had a lot of goals to achieve and i'm achieving each one one by one, it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness, my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend as that's something we enjoy to do, healthy <hea> going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit, uh, probably, as a strong-willed person with a big heart, but has a short fuse and, maybe complains about his own life too much, i wish i could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side, well one time i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was horrible and then i felt it was the best thing i'd ever done, so that and i would don't understand how anybody could could feel that way, and i didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest opinion <opi> evaluation so therefore i felt bad about that, as it's my goal, no nothing i regret, i felt, hmm ten or twenty years ago, i don't know, um <sigh>, well everything i do i enjoy it's hard to to pick out one exact event that i really enjoyed, uh i don't know, how to put one above the other, when things don't go my way and finances come down and i don't get jobs that i go for that i am qualified for but i feel i am not getting, my fair chance, at opportunity, it's very frustrating, i don't really feel guilty about things, sometimes maybe if i'm angry and i shouldn't be i feel guilty about that i don't ever wanna be, short with my girlfriend ever, she wouldn't doesn't deserve somebody um using vulgar language or shouting, or something so i don't wanna be that way around her so therefore that i am guilty, my achievements of my abilities through my music and my other abilities that i have and of my hard work has paid off and uh, i'm very proud of those, okay thank you, goodbye",1
464,", mhm, i'm doing well, what about you?, mhm, um, i a <l> let's go close but, i currently reside <res>residence in inglewood, wait, did i answer your question?, i don't know., all right., oj l 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1., um, wall paintings, the sea, what else is it?, the people, my family's over here., this is the best part, what about you?, oh, wait., um, i'd say, the smog, yeah, the air could be cleaner., and, yeah, that's good., um, that's pretty <pre> i mean, there are also good and bad people., but yes, for the most part it's all good, yes, i was in mexico and the temples., and northern california so yes, travel, like clean air that is good it is healthier for your body, clean blood flow, who are for people, culture, and stories and when you come back, share stories like your friends, yeah, anytime., like now, or if , okay, like this one time i was little, we went to the temples., and it started to rain, so let's just start going through and like if we got to the top of a thing i didn't know before, the higher you go, the higher you go., the smaller the steps become, so, how people had it back then, uh smaller feet, so what happened was, as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways, so that my feet could measure up to the steps, but when you get up there, it's a nice view, i don't know what to do., general education, but, mainly art, yes, i've taken a lot of art lessons, uh, good., when i was a child, i crawled on walls with chalk, so i thought you know how it kind of stuck with me, i was just following it., so, yeah, that's good., my dream job, would be paid for painting, painting art, yeah, that's good., um, yeah, that's good., pretty simple, um, it's not so much that it's hard, it just needs passion, um, persistence, and faith and will, you just really have to believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself, the more likely you are to be successful, mhm, i think i'm shy in some way, time and places, but i'm also going out when, how i have the energy, so, i have a feeling it's well balanced., as if i were shy when it, i guess.., okay, to be shy, you know, and i'll go when, like the need to actually, to have fun or just to explore, it feels good like, if that makes sense, but yes, < slaughter>, yeah, that's good., to relax, um, i don't know if i should say that, but i smoke weeds <laughter>, so this helps, and, i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax, you know especially when i blue the color, because the color blue relaxes around me, and also green, when i use these two colors and take a picture, it calms me, yeah, and you got a blue shirt, yeah., my temperament, to good my thoughts, my thoughts control my feelings, and my feelings, yeah, that's pretty much like that, my temper, i'm trying to make sense, you know, how good it is to go crazy, or when i get angry, what will be the result, you know, so, controlling my temperament is easy, through the formation of my thought, to <sigh>, the last time i had a fight with someone, was with my father, and it was because i wanted to eat, but he wanted me to buy wine, so right, when the food was ready, i was hungry to eat and he was like no, so that somehow frustrations me, and, the way i treated it was how good, i could just eat when i get back and i'll do him a favor., you know, and then, after you know that i could just eat in peace, so, yeah, that's good., my family, it's pretty good., um, my mother my father have a good relationship still < s> still married, and my brothers and sisters, we help each other out, so that's good, it's just, yeah, it's like a team., a situation i wish i could handle differently, hmm, that's a good question., i mean,, can i get a scenerio, all right., um, a situation i could deal with differently, now see, that's the thing, how i feel like, if i'm quiet in any situation, i could find out., you know, but when it came to a rubik cube, maybe, how would i deal with the situation just by, uh fail uh fail make mistakes, because i would make the right mistakes and follow the right lessons, so, this is the best way to answer your question., you know, yeah, that's good., a positive influence, pretty much., anyone who told me the truth was a positive influence you know., for example , yes, even if it may hurt like oh the truth hurts, well, they're not trying to be mean, they're actually, good influences, so i would say my friends, my mom, my dad., my brother my sisters, yeah, that's good., mm, see, that's kind of like, you like me i've had some pretty bad experiences with as on shot tip and with a knife, but at the end of the day, what it did was to give me more insight, it made me more conscious, and, it taught me how to read people a little more like, easy to feel things and also how to avoid situations so, although it was bad and it kind of like, scare me, it prepared me like, the world you know because that happened to me when i was twelve thirteen years old, so i was already exposed like, you know, like rifle knives and all that stuff., it's bad, but it's good in the long run., you know it because, when you get out of the burglary, it's like, nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know it in your head like oh i've been through worse, so it's not so bad that you know, and, so yes., the toughest, um, man, see this right now uh for a moment when i was stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it, but uh toughest decision as far as life changes, lives, whether the school should continue, higher education, or not, mm i somehow chosen, to like, i went to school, but i decided to pursue my own like, i learn more by connecting with people who are already in the field where i want to be., so that was a tough choice, because there is no, in order to guarantee that i, for example , how to run the right people, but i took the risk, and you know i met the right people., yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., it's really very simple, sometimes it's like i could sleep in ten minutes., i could turn my mind off like i'm just calming down., how slow down my air patterns, yeah, that's good., mhm, lately, i felt, good, i feel like i have free will., how at this point in time i feel like, when i have chosen a path, of a kind used in the manufacture of motor vehicles, my heart, i could, you know you're here., but i'm kind of like, still decide it's like everything in all these paths in the air, i'm just trying to make my own, i don't know., that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will, so yes., lately as in the last two weeks or today, < slaughter>, all right., yeah, you know., um, yeah, that's good., things happen that would change like, my feelings and, for example, right now it just happened, what are you doing?, for now as, this experience for one is like a shift in my mind, because, yeah, it's like, it's technology you know it's like a journey to see how far, for example , you could think about it, and then do it, reality, so that's kind of like moving my thoughts right now, this experience this whole experience, yeah, that's good., uh post traumatic stress disorder, no, depression i know what it's like to be depressed, but diagnosed by a doctor, depression, how, how it feels, how does depression feel?, it feels like, it's like a bird in a cage, being depression is like, a fish that cannot swim in the water, i feel like depression is like a bird without wings, um, pretty much it feels, as if you were limited., but then the thing is, to get out of this depression, it's like you have to, awaken and change your perspective, and focus on, as i would say colors help colors, and help people who talk to people, yeah, that's good., be depressed, mm let's see, mm, i don't know., for example , it could come as if it could happen every day, like in small doses., so, as i could say today you know earlier when i was just alone i felt a little depressed, but then what happened i fixed it like, called a friend and, met with him and yeah, i mean, at this moment, i feel pretty happy that you know., i'm talking to a virtual person, it's pretty cool, and, yeah, that's good., now i feel happy., < slaughter>, um, sometimes hard head, like he's trying to teach me.., a certain lesson, whether it's art, or as in my character, and, yeah, he'd probably just describe me like that., for example , for example , he would listen, but at the same time he will still do what he wants to do, pretty much like, i don't know., yeah, i mean, that's what he's telling me, but yeah overall good person, probably just exercise, around my diet food, my food intake, and yes, just movement, pretty much it, my health, mm, i'd say when i was in middle school., or, elementary, also a little high school, but what it would, yes, what it would be, it would be either, um, good pretty much my art <laughter>, like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kind of like, like garbage, and then i'd be like oh, damn it., either i could accept it and be like yeah it somehow looks and then fix it, or what i'd do back then would be like fucking you know, just linger on that thought., and then just like, stay a little while and i'll finally get out., of course., most of the time, it's people's words., and ideas, the, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's it., regret, yes, i have some things i regret, like what?, all right., sometimes i feel like i should have finished a whole university thing., but, i mean at the same time i feel like, if i really wanted to go, i had been going, so yes., that's some kind of regret in my head, ten or twenty years ago would be to seek spiritually, feeling comfortable, you know, learn how to choose your thoughts your thoughts i would teach myself, um, choose the right people you surround yourself with because it definitely has a big influence in your environment, uh certain events that you would experience, and as far as your general happiness, yeah, that's good., yeah among other things, but yeah, what i'm most proud of right now, is my painting, yeah, that's good., i'm proud of it because, i feel like these pictures i'm releasing are things no one else could duplicate., you know, it's like it's some kind of thing and it's like where you know it., it has its own signature, so, so yeah, i'm pretty happy about it, yes, thank you very much., all right, thank you., mhm, goodbye., < slaughter>",0
455,", yes, very good, oh, you're kidding., mhm, uh finished school and came out to start my life, uh not often now, not really often, because my parents both died and so that's my reason for that was my reason to go home, before, there really is no comparison., they know it's warm and, sunny, and this has four seasons, so it's a completely different environment, it took me a minute., to adapt to the different culture, but after i've been adjusted, you know the sunshine keeps you here, i love the weather, i love the fact that i have the sea and the mountains, and all the things i can choose from and the diversity i find here, uh i, tend not to have things i don't like, uh, where i am, i know i'll find myself there, so and i like myself, so that means there's really nothing i don't like, yes, i do., uh i love to explore different cultures able to meet different people have a different set of experiences, and at the same time be able to share the common ground between, all kinds of people, it is a very rich experience, um, which, to the, uh i, i am thinking of egypt and the wonderful experiences i have there., i'm leaving., the people and the, warm and loving experience i have the knowledge that i get to follow, by exploring the temples and pyramids etcetera things like that, there are so many there really are, but i can imagine seeing a baby in a mosque., that was just really pure and it, really stayed with me, how similar, we are actually all, this is probably one of the things i remember most about one of my very first trips., uh, there he is., and, let's see., only the interaction of people the food you know incredible i love the food too, wow, i've studied a lot of different things i've studied, right, that i've studied., entertainment i have studied the communication i have studied, whatever i want a pretty renaissance woman, < slaughter>, < slaughter>, it was always my way of exploring all the things i enjoy, keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive, and to allow me simply to be able,, as a human being able to do this fully developed, mhm, um, i don't have a dream job, per se, what i have is a.., desire to simply be able to do freely what it is that i choose, on a daily basis, uh probably more outgoing, mhm, < slaughter>, well, i start my day very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform, before i move around uh i get movement, so that i keep everything in motion, and then on from there, uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have a, argued, um, can't remember the last time i actually had an argument, um, i don't know what this is about., i imagine that the last time i argued about something might probably be related to money., situation i wish i had handled differently, you know, i'm trying to take every experience, how they come and try not to regret, feelings of guilt about the way everything, uh went because they're all very positive learning experiences for me, uh, that i'm exploring who i'm through, so i don't really see them as, that they must be different, i have to learn from them, or just accept what is, mhm, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, um, have not really a quote on quote difficult, decision you know because i grew up in a way, where my mother was extreme, wonderful in the way she always taught me to know that it was my own life, and so she would never make decisions for me, she always taught me to say she would always say, it's your life., and so, to make decisions for me not really come, as difficult to make, they're pretty easy to do because i've been doing them since childhood, so i don't really have a, most difficult, decision i've ever made, mm, event that i could erase from my memory i could not really think of one that i could think of that would be so terrible that i would need to, delete it again everything for me is a learning experience, so there is nothing really to regret or delete, uh very easy, once i hit the pillow, i'm out, uh, great uh a little more, uh, physical exertion as normal, but uh still great, < slaughter>, , the spiritual practices that i carry out on a daily basis that keep me pretty, evenly tempered, no, mm, no, that's pretty much every day., <laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm grateful i'm grateful, for my life and i'm only grateful for everything that comes into it, uh, very smart uh, very loving uh very intelligent, funny, uh, going out., that's probably what my friends would say, there's really nothing i think i need, <laughter> to do, have or be different uh about myself, as if i were okay with everything as it is, i really am, < slaughter>, what advice i would have given myself ten or twenty years ago, to know, um, to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago, was important in terms of the development of the person i am now, and, so simple, be able to go with the river and go with the experiences of life to be able to, learn to move effortlessly through any situation that arises, recently really enjoyed, uh, uh cooked a very wonderful meal, because i love to cook, so that was something i really enjoyed, mhm, wow my willingness to meet me, by exploring practices and practical application, from everything i have learned about human cultures, places and the most important, you know, the god in me, see you.",1
469,", yes, i'm fine., oj l 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1., mm, there's a lot of variety, there's a lot of health oriented stuff., there are all kinds of food you can eat in the desert you can go to, you can go anywhere i mean, there are a lot of, and the weather is great, transport in order to , lately the change of the weather is somehow a little too unpredictable, but it is mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of the people, i wouldn't say much, just occasionally., uh it's nice to do a change of scenery and different things that maybe i wouldn't normally do different people around, learning about different people different customs around, depends on it, i mean, if there is a water really pretty water and you know that in beautiful water around, relaxing, adventure i love adventure, uh <laughter> uh some time ago i went to cayman islands and around, i went seasick, but my sister gave me medication and i went on a boat and we snorted and there were two boats and i accidentally got back on the wrong boat, um, yes and they're really crazy, they let me jump back into the water and let me swim to the right boat <laughter>, and i thought i was drowning because the water was pretty rough, i was really shocked that they wanted me to., yes, but i survived <laughter>, yeah, pretty good., uh management, but also, also hypnotherapy, i didn't hear that other question., um, well, i came from a serious arta family, so that seems just something that would be universal that would cover a lot of different topics, yes, yes, but by yes and no, i mean now, i kind of wish it was something else, i like communication i love speaking and interviewing strangers, i'm very extraordinary and funny., probably something like either liberal art communication would have been this kind of thing, uh dream job would be just out there you know how some of these people might explore on t v different places and always paid for it and anyway always like a fun adventure, uh interacts with people, to do things i haven't done yet, and, helping people, you know in a way with what i do that you can see that you know, that i am uncoordinated and in a way and you know that they may be uncoordinated and also have fun <laughter>, uh i watch t v i go work out around i walk i recently got like a bike that i somehow set up a kind of, to do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping, interaction with friends call them see them, this kind of thing, talking to strangers, um, depends on the situation, there are a number of times when i'm good at it, when it comes to traffic and cars, it's a little more intense for me, it's a little harder for me., or people who are like really rude, you know with the way they cut you off, almost <laughter>, luckily not, you know, i'm very persuasive and maybe too much sometimes, where when someone gets something really rude with me in a parking lot i get, i'll confront her sometimes., um, maybe i was with my sister., it had to do with the subject, but whatever she said was not right and we have in an argument it sounds childish about who was right, you know, because she thinks she's always the smarter because she's older, sometimes it's frustrating because it's like it's not a profit situation she just wants to attach to someone until you know that they realize she's right., um, other times, i just let it go and let it clap because it, it's kind of not productive., i'm really close to seeing my parents almost every weekend, more close to my mother., i have a twin sister, i'll stay in touch with her even though she's not in town, she's out of town, and i have two other sisters, so i'll stay in touch with her., all of them, you know it's a mixed bag you know., we somehow have a self confident aggressiveness in us a little bit, <sigh>, but also, um, well, i'm, uh, i'm, uh, i'm, uh, i'm, uh.., i mean strangers, sometimes my family, you know they did nice things for me., foreigners were, very to sometimes unexpected very nice, i could go shopping and you know i'm, maybe i can't reach something, and a guy shows up behind me, and you know, without me saying anything, just help me.., that kind of thing or.., if someone is mean to me, someone likes, commit <laughter> you know and to, , um, i had a situation with a neighbor years ago, where he was really angry with me, because he thought i, you know, i'm not crazy about dogs, but he freaked out for a year and a half, and.., i wish i'd seen that when other people weren't there., because i, you know, but it caused a lot of fear for me because i feel like i could have nipped it in the bud and instead of me with the.., main load of him, now he and i aren't talking at all, i think it's best that he's kind of weird., hmm, god, there was a lot, um, sometimes break up with someone or.., <sigh>, yes, it's usually or get rid of a friend, this kind of thing, um, sometimes i feel guilty about, some of my previous behavior with people around, where i may not have been so understanding.., when i was younger, i stole things that you know is not the best behavior, and.., and it's like this stuff, oh, god, there's a lot of them around, i wish i could erase you., hard my father was on us as children, and, delete a lot of memories of men i use with that just doesn't work well at all, and, yeah, that's good., i can run away like, now, yeah, that's good., curly <laughter> irritated around, schnarky <laughter>, um, i was afraid of money and relationships because i haven't been in one for so long., male <laughter>, just a lot of fear around, yeah., sigh> take a deep breath around, try and do positive things that you sometimes know, to eat healthier work more to talk to my friend about it, this kind of thing, try and look for interesting activities to do, to distract me, < sniffle>, good not official but i know you know about, things i've experienced that i've had, i know that i'm getting very scared in certain situations, yeah, it's

in my room < s> my uh room you know where i am it bothers me, yeah, a long time ago., it's been a long time., maybe over ten years ago, 15 years ago, um, i was depressed <laughter> i mean <laughter> i know there's nothing to laugh about, but i mean, it's kind of, in a circle around, only, to the, wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more, um, feeling stuck in certain thoughts, a lot of negative thoughts about feeling hopelessness helplessness, this kind of thing, , um, i go occasionally, it's another guy around, i will go to a hypnotherapist, sometimes to release <rel> <rel> fear that is inside me, yes i do very useful, um, much more awareness for me and other people, learning more control more confidence to better self esteem to willy to try, even more things you know, whether i know the result or not, you know about the unknown, i'm going to experiment a lot more, , um, help like the twenty five miles of water and there were some people who did it for the first time, an event at my sister's, where there were only a few of us and.., i cracked a lot of jokes sometimes i'm like really funny you know, and i can't even believe even you know that i'm just going on and on, you know, everybody starts laughing, i don't even try and i just say like normal stories and people look at me funny and laugh, yeah that, to be truly decent loyal uh empathetic around, earn, um, supporting i hope <laughter> to, out of quirky, type of person, um, good it would be great, uh look even younger uh or be younger, if the human was possible <laughter> around, be more patient with

334,"all right., yes, pretty good a little tired, washtone seattle washton , when i was 18, my parents decided we wanted to move to california, so we moved to pasadena., yeah, that's good., i went to work about two years ago and took a look at the area, pretty simple actually, i'll adjust., the warm weather not with rain nine months of the year around, population in the first place, the uh the area, how big it is traffic, when i first came here, the smog, that's better now, no, when i was younger, i was but i got away with the work i did., sure, when i became, when i died my mother and i needed work, i went for a job called petition, and uh you have to go to the stores and talk to people about signing petitions, and you do that after a while you won't be shy about talking to someone, even when i was in school, i took public speaking and i learned that it really liked more than i thought i would, so i did the census job that i actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to do the test and i enjoyed it., right now, i'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance., um, and i'll start working uh trying to get money from people uh help kids in the uh in the world, well, the one on the uh job helping kids was also a paid job i needed a paid job, the uh one for insurance i was getting older and i needed work that was steadfast and that's something i can do until i'm eighty five or ninety or whatever., < slaughter>, to be an artist, well, i was good with art, i like painting et cetera, but i didn't know if i could ever live with it, so i never really came in and every time i tried, i never seemed to have come anywhere, so maybe if i'm like eighty or ninety maybe i'm going to go into ceramic or something like that and do that as a profession, not unfortuantely i do not, that's okay., i'm not, my mother and father are dead i have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or i don't talk to them or anything, well, i have a kind of attitude that if i have myself and friends i'm okay, uh read, uh, watch sports when they are available, uh let's see i used to play golf i can do that again one day, but not now because of the cost and time, people who are rude, well, normally i ignore it this morning actually i told a guy to stop what he did and we got some kind of argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done, very good because i had a very bad temper when i was a child and i told myself that i had to control it, this morning because of the guy who makes a lot of noise., and in a place that just wasn't the place to do it, i mean, it was a public place, but.., and that was just a small argument and i'm done with the argument as soon as i say what i say <laughter>, yes, not now that i can think, uh how to read, um, when i can travel i travel uh i don't travel long distances, but even out to the river is a kind of adventure for me, seeing things on the way, and back, talk to people, maybe, well a number of years ago i went back east to uh massachusetts, to work there on the way back, i took a greyhound bus all the way back from washton d c all the way back to california, uh into the washtone first and then from down there, and uh, work in massachusettes for about six months to eight months, enjoyed the area a little, but didn't want to be there when the snow came, and uh, enjoyed back in the bus had people near me almost all the way different people and, had a lot of fun, yeah, that's good., yes, i was in the air force and uh when i was eighteen nineteen sixty five during the vietnam war, no i was in big falls montana, it really didn't years later i probably uh learned more from the fact that i got out early and maybe i would have stayed in, and stayed there, but i tended to end things when i was younger and so now that and other things i decided never to end anything, i came down here uh played pool for a number of years uh finally graduated from high school that i had dropped when i moved, uh went to college got my bachelor's degree and an a a degree from pasadena and cal state l a and started working different jobs and uh that's it, took care of my mother, uh business that was my head i also studied cyclical anthropology and philosophy and history et cetera, no, not never depressed <de>, lately not so good between the fact that i sleep in my car and it's very cold and then sometimes i get uh, and with all the things in my life right now i'm thinking about things and so and plus i get up at four thirty in the morning, that's okay., uh tired, and sometimes i get a little grumpy but not very, tired with all the things i had to do and uh weather and sleep, no, uh a little sometimes about how maybe i should have started all this years ago, i'll just keep going., i'm basically telling myself to stop it and keep doing what things to improve, not very anymore, it took me years to study to do that., i don't know if you call it zen or not, but, a few months ago, when i passed all my tests, and uh medicare <medi> uh medicare advantage, and all of them for every company she sent to me, i stick to everything i do now, i'm persistent, i won't leave things out of my hands until i do something about it., i used to be uh, what's the word?, i'm putting things away that i don't do anymore., and uh, i always treat people beautiful, until given a reason not to, and i usually don't talk to anyone about my bad stuff, < slaughter>, not very, because the same thing that i have trained over the years, so as not to talk about myself, i'm talking to other people, i'm talking about them., let's see., my mother, gandy, um, bertrand russell, let's see., i'm not sure who else, other people i had, but i don't remember their names or they were teachers et cetera, earlier in life uh like i said uh everything didn't end things i'm very sorry about, nope., i could have done better., probably the advice i've given myself to get out of my butt and learn and get an education uh and continue to do something with my life, that i have survived, well, i'm sixty five, i slept in my car for a number of years i went from sleeping to sidewalk where i got a car, while i did improve my credit rating, i got a number of jobs that i was very satisfied with., i had a lot of friends., both homeless people who are homeless and not homeless, and uh, i'm in pretty good health, and where like other people in my family died young, so i think that's what this is about., uh good jokes, uh people who have a happy time, go and have a drink with someone on an occasional basis, about eight months ago was the last time i had a beer with someone, let's see., probably uh, always within a foot of a living wild deer, it was in uh green lake in washton, and i uh was behind our house and this wild deer walked in the field and i started moving, and it came within about a foot of me, and the only reason why it left my father drove the ride way and it made noise and the deer ran away i was in fondle distance from him and i wasn't sure if he would have petted or not, but i was about to <laughter>, like you, see

love to work with children, yes, dishonesty maybe, um, like if a guy like especially when it comes to relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal, my mom i wanna say my mom, um very close we talk every day, very close even though i don't live with them i try to see them as much as i can, uh it's okay <laughter>, it's it's good, it's, yes i do , um they're they're friendly it's just that they're very quiet, 'cause i'm not used to that environment, it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine i just wish it was a little bit it could've been better so yeah , yes <laughter> , um i had a different option to live with somebody else, and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that i live with so i kinda regret moving in with the roommates i have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever , that's fine, how do i know who, i, yeah <laughter>, there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head, um, um, maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe , that really gets me mad, mm yes , because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah, yeah, wow, i hardly ever argue with somebody <laughter>, yeah, oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago, uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all, um, just her getting into grown folks' business and, it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said, and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter> , and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people, that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that, yeah so but i mean we're fine now, so that's good, yeah, to not , believe people so easily, so gullible to not be so gullible, i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um, yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances , so, yeah, when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um when i was sixteen about six years ago, yeah <laughter>, yeah i mean yeah i guess it was <laughter>, no i really want to though, um, trying new things seeing new views of the world um trying the different type of foods um seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there i guess, um, yeah i plan to go to the bahamas next year, i plan to do a lot of traveling next year actually, so, yeah, it's pretty good, eh somewhat, i'm tired <laughter> and i kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot, yeah, it's my fault though, um probably today, yeah, well i fell asleep late so <laughter> it's my fault, um no i feel pretty happy right now, mhm, no, no, no, very friendly and funny, talkative, um through high school , we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week i'll try to see them at least every few months, mm they're everywhere <laughter> um yeah, no comment on that, they're more smarter they are learning more stuff than we learned back in the day they are learning they're very progressing but when it comes to technology they're not outside they're always on the computer on their phones they don't play outside no more they don't care about nature or the little things in life they just yeah but when it comes to their mentality they argue smarter 'cause the schools are getting better i ain't gonna lie so , when what happened, i was just, okay, um last weekend i guess, right now, um , what did i do, um being with my boyfriend makes me really happy so i was just hanging out with him last weekend and i never really get to see him that much so yeah , 'cause he works i

488,"<synch>, yes, fine, oh san fernando valley, uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around, it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system, uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel, um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class, yeah it was fun, hmm <sigh>, i think it's tough to say, um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley, and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night, philosophy, yes, um, hmm, i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked, all the different, ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy, huh, i don't know but i really like children and i really like, studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it, i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i, i think i'm pretty friendly, um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read, um, yeah, i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about, other things if i start getting mad or um, i just start trying to focus on my breathing, i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend, um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um, i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party, and he was getting frustrated, which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with, well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and, i, really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out, hmm, i think a lot of times when my, oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother, uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close, as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i, and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him, hmm, um, when i was nineteen, i came home, from a party, i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things, and then he didn't speak to me for about a year, uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home, um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could, um <sigh>, and i love my siblings i, again my little sister and i get along really well she's, four years younger than me, and when, when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and, i wasn't, in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore, and that's really great, and, we get along okay with my uh, my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve, , one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good, uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and, who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that, i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but, generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning, um, well i'm really tired i can get grumpy, but i think usually i'm just, groggy, pretty good i'm a little anxious about, um, about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about, it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time, um, yeah, <sigh> well, i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic, no, no, hmm, well i think the last time i felt really happy i, went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party, and um, i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people, and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun, um she would probably say that, i'm smart and uh, pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch, really like serious films and t_v, um, and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot, well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so, um so that's a major one that and procrastinating, hmm, um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh, uh given, eh, sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was, very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem, like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock, speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job, but it was, was not, great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation, well i would've been twelve, and two, um, but i think, i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think, i was a little selfish and self-involved back then, i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and, um, i do regret, a couple of, semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a, a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript, i think so i'm, i think i, i wasn't focusing in school at that time, and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that, hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then, going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges, and then maybe, going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping, and maybe watching a little bit of t_v, huh, well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up, i'm ten years older than him so, and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which, made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and, um and how close we are",0

yoga, things that drive me crazy, injustice <laughter> i can be very sincerely outraged i suppose to, people who don't see these things and people who have a similar claim, i think, claim and feeling of privilege that can drive me crazy, yeah, that's good., uh , it depends that i usually argue with <usual> often that i appreciate my case <laughter> or i usually call my best friend and complain, talk to her about it, pretty good pretty good i don't have too much temperament, um, like a real argument or like a debate, <laughter>um, if it were a real argument, it would probably be my ex boyfriend, and we were just arguing about why we separated stupid things like this., oh, i think i was kind of, over them until then, but, it was sometimes, < slaughter>, um , the last time i felt really happy, has been, how really happy, probably hanging out with friends last night i had a good time, uh, , it's nice., it's nice., my best friend would describe me as an open book, for which she often makes fun of me, as if she would just tell everyone everything around her would make me, compassionate, and, with a strong feeling about who i am, i think, yes, she would also consider me as not like a good feeling of social norms sometimes likely that is something that she, makes fun of me because i want to tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have holes in my clothes and something like that, but nothing, nothing bad we have a very good relationship, hmm, yeah yeah it doesn't have terrible problems but yes, it got me in trouble before sure, no, i didn't, no, but i think i had it, but i've never been to a doctor., because i had a traumatic situation where someone hurt me., and i, i felt that when i saw p t s d later, i realized that i felt as if i had all the symptoms of how again in situations like that i would panic and it was very, uh i thought it was a really long time, i think.., i think i had it, but i just don't know because i've never seen anyone about it., um , sometimes yes uh, certain physical things with this part of my body can be a trigger or around, it happened in a acting class, so sometimes certain teachers, when they, to criticize in a certain way, i start to panic, even if they're absolutely right and i know they're right and as if it were something that, someone else could tell me and i'd agree to it, sometimes it'll make me a little excited or panicky yeah, no, well, i mean, my dad's sick, so not great, but when you think about it, it's not terrible., i have bad dreams., uh , like stress dreams i'm dealing with my dad., um , like being abducted or my teeth fall things that when you always tell them as if there was something outside your control that's like exactly what it's so, it's not the best, but it's just dreams, at least so, in which direction, all right., easy very simple, i'm tired and maybe a little irritable silly i'm gonna be really silly, yeah, that's good., um, i, i'm pretty non judgmental, from other people i stay open, i can make most people laugh., uh creative, um, i, yes, these are some of the best i would say, yeah, that's good., i love meeting new people and seeing and learning new things uh and just getting out of the routine i like to stay in hotels uh i like most things about traveling i even like to fly i like all of it, well, i just finished a tour a few months ago to go up and down the east coast and then perform across the u s and uh for kids everywhere, yes and then we ended up here in l a, yeah, yeah, it was great, it was a good time, yeah, that's good., um , lemmi we think, we went to, the hot springs the naturally occurring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to relax, yeah, that's good., a lot of people i would say, i mean, my dad's probably coming to my mind., uh my godmother is a great positive influence in my life as well, uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some of my best friends from high school around and college that i somehow grew up with and, will be who i am with them, yeah, that's good., mhm, uh, little things for sure, yeah, that's good., uh, i regret, the way i dealt with it, a friendship that once ended uh i regret, to bind to certain people i was with, uh , but nothing big i tend to go well i won't do it again, but i don't spend much time, how excited about things i've done in the past, hmm, get up for yourself., um , <laughter> don't date criminals <laughter> uh, i think that i, i have no difficulty standing for things i believe in, but sometimes i have difficulty standing up for myself., i think i really internalize the idea of how, you know women are too needy or.., i don't know these kinds of things and then and so as a teenager and growing up i felt like you were good then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took a while to be able to like voice what i want, what i needed from other people and agree with, and it's still something i'm working on, i'm glad you think so., um , <sigh>, that's a good question., my friends and family, and uh, i mean talents, i'd say, yeah, that's good., yes my ability to take situations and, take up bad situations and continue and, make the best of everything, all right., <laughter> thank you, goodbye <laughter>",12
449,"<synch>, okay, yes i am, i'm good thank you, <laughter>, originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america, yes, the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to, traffic <laughter> busyness everybody's always in a hurry um, um that's about it, <laughter>, when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to, go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean, the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>, um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from, so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home, so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom, and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way, experiences on vacation or, um most memorable experience, probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so, having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause, no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>, business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field, so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field, my dream job, hmm, well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook, and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family, if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now, but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job, i'm outgoing, <laughter>, <laughter> that's cool <laughter>, uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at, and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e, so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation, figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first, i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with, um i don't really let anything agitate me, and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just, do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it, be who you are and just stay there, actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it, and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways, and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings, when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because, the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic, and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard, hmm <sigh> let's see, i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old, and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it, he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look go looking for him or call for him, as opposed to waiting him to call me, and i think, it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come, and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place, but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but, i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult, and then also not expected him to just kinda you know, i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense, woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and, i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so, it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally, so, my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect, so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect, seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change, but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just, kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that, i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own, and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but, whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me, it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real, it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy, um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own, and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just, being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that, wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here, so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing, it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure, uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling, but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter, so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent, divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me, and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore, and, since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while, um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just, did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of, how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything, physical and and all the material stuff i could care less, but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about, uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that, he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it, bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home, and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change despite all the counseling we went through, and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself, in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return, <laughter>, you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day, my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night, i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody, did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma, i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today, and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to, go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day, really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son, my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance, but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle, that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little, mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not, <laughter>, no i haven't thank god, no, really happy let's see, uh it's at home and i think it was when, wow, <mumbling> different things running through my head um, i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on, our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me, and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me, without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself, and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very, tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me, <laughter>, thank you, um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very, you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be, um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do, and i just you know i don't, i don't deal with b s <laughter>, hmm what could i change about myself, uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself, um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um, i think i would just be, a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware, make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody, i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me, so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret, because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that, everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it, what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys, hmm, be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am, to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure, be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me, don't try to revamp <re>, don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not, uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders, but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it, but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments, my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what, at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle, that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary, , and i'm always just, true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that, i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from, <laughter>, cool, thank you, bye",2
393,"yes, i'm fine., i am originally from los angeles california, i like the weather, i like a lot of things, uh, the women., such things, traffic is ridiculous as if it were out of control like, the way people drive here, economy, uh i just wanted to be an entrepreneur how i wanted to work for myself, so that's why i did this., yeah, i'm just.., <tisk> uh to be a c e o of a company, it shouldn't be that hard, but it'll be a challenge. it's a challenge., don't get me wrong, i mean sometimes it varies i can be shy sometimes, but then i'm mostly starting, sure, i mean, when it comes to certain things like say,, i'm going to a club or a party and i see a girl i want to talk to, i'm going to talk to her., but when it comes to a lot of people like sometimes i get a little shy and uh reserved, uh, i'm training, hanging out with my friends, that's what i do, i'm pretty good at it, i don't really let things come to me, it's been a while since i didn't argue with anyone., i had like a little argument about something, but uh, that was a few weeks ago and, it wasn't something that was serious, it's just.., some things i had to clarify with uh someone, it was about a girl, and i asked her a few questions about a few things., why she tried, uh, come back with her ex like this doesn't make any sense to me, um, <lip smacking> i'd say my relationship with my brother i wish we didn't have uh, i wish we could have done that., without fighting each other, my relationship with my family is pretty cool like my mother who i am with my mother <sniff>, and i get along with my sister, so it's pretty it's pretty uh, cool, i'm pretty, i'm very close to my family., i'd have to say, a few friends i met recently, i met some people through my church., , he's like a mentor to me., um, i don't know, i don't think i have that in my memory., that i want to delete this, um, i'd have to say it was uh, whether or not., as far as possible, i'd say what career i'm going to be in and all that., i mean,, high school for me got pretty, it went well and i could have done better., and around, ended uh, not really live <li> uh live up to my potential, i don't know, i mean, i really don't know., it's pretty easy, it's no problem <laughter> i could just knock when i go home at night, tired uh, only mainly uh tired, i'd say, i've been fine lately., i've been, no, no i didn't, no i didn't, i'd say, it should have been.., when i got the uh car i got now, i just got a nice car and it's pretty fast, i'd say.., he would describe me as someone who is not a stoper, someone who endures, no, for whatever i want, whatever it is, whatever i want out of life just for it, do not hesitate, um, i would have to say, at the moment, my weight as i, i put on a few pounds and i'm working on losing those pounds., maybe when i was little in school probably, uh pretty much uh i got bullied, so that's pretty much what happened, um, i'm smart, i'm smart, a hard worker, um, i'm a good person., um, i'd have to say uh, with the same, come together with uh, with my friends, and, we just hang out and talk about things, it's going on in our lives and all.",2

334,"okay, yes, pretty good a little tired, seattle washington, uh when i was eighteen my mom and dad decided we wanted to move to california and uh so we moved down to pasadena uh actually monrovia first and i've been here ever since , yeah, i did about two years ago i went up for work and a look around the area, pretty easy actually, i do adapt, the warm weather not having rain nine months of the year um, people mainly, the uh the area how big it is the traffic, when i first got here the smog that's better now, no when i was younger i was but i got outta that with work i did, sure when i became when i my mom died and i needed work i went for a job that was called petitioning, and uh you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions, and you do that after awhile you don't get shy about talking to anybody also when i was in school i took public speaking and i learned that really liked it more than i thought i would, so i so i did the census job i actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to take the test and i enjoyed it, right now i'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance, um, and i'm gonna start work uh trying to get money from people to uh help kids in the uh in the world, well the on the uh job helping kids was also a paid job i needed a paid job, the uh one for insurance was i was getting older and i needed work that was steady and that's something i can do till i'm eighty five or ninety or whatever , <laughter>, to be an artist, well i've been good with art, i like drawing painting et cetera, but i didn't know if i could ever make a living in it so i never really got into it and every time i tried it seemed i never got anywhere , so maybe when i get like eighty or ninety maybe i'll go into ceramics or something and do that as a profession, no unfortuantely i don't, that's okay, i'm not, my mom and dad are die are dead i have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or i don't talk to them anymore or like that , well i have kind of an attitude that if i have me and friends i have then i'm okay, uh read, uh, watch sports when they're available, uh let's see i used to play golf i may do that again some day but not right now because of the cost and the time, people that are rude, well usually i ignore it this morning actually i told a guy to stop what he was doing and we got kind of an argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done , very good because i had a very bad temper when i was a kid and i told myself i had to control it, uh this morning about the guy making lots and lots of noise uh on purpose, and uh in a place that was just not the place to do it i mean it was a public place, but uh, and that was it just a little argument and i'm done with the argument once i say what i say <laughter>, yes, not right now that i can think of, uh like read, um, if i can travel i travel uh i don't travel long distances but even going out to riverside is kind of an adventure for me, seeing things on the way, and back, talking to people maybe, well a number of years ago i went drove back east to uh massachusetts, to do work back there on the way back i took a greyhound bus all the way back from washington d_c all the way back to california , uh into washington first and then down from there, and uh, worked in massachusettes for about oh uh six months to eight months , enjoyed the area quite a bit but didn't want to be there when the snow came, and uh, enjoyed coming back on the bus had people near next to me almost all the way different people and, had a lot of fun, yeah, yeah i was in the airforce and uh when i was eighteen nineteen sixty five during the vietnam war, no i was in great falls montana, it it really didn't years later i probably uh learned more from the fact that i got out early and maybe i should have stayed in, and stuck with it but i tended to quit things when i was younger and so now that and other things i decided never to quit anything, i came down here uh played pool for a number of years uh finally graduated from high school which i had dropped out of when i moved, uh went on to college got my bachelor's degree and an a_a degree at pasadena and cal state l_a and started working various jobs and uh that's about it, took care of my mom, uh business that was my major i also studied cyclic anthropology and philosphy and history et cetera, no, no never depressed <de>, lately not so good between the fact that i sleep in my car and it's very cold and then sometimes i do get uh, and with all the things going on in my life right now i i think of things and so and plus i get up at four thirty in the morning , that's okay, uh tired, and i get a little grumpy sometimes but not very much, tired with all the things i've had to do and uh weather and sleep, no, uh a little bit sometimes about how maybe i should've started doing all this years ago, i just go on, i tell myself to basically stop it and to uh go on doing what things to uh improve myself, not very anymore, it took me years to study that to do that, i don't know if you call it zen or not but, uh couple months ago when i passed all my tests, and uh medicare <medi> uh medicare advantage, and passed everyone of 'em for every company that sent 'em to me, i stick to everything i do now i'm persistent , i don't let things get out of hand before i do something about it, i used to be uh, what's the word, i put off things i don't do that anymore, and uh, i treat people nicely always, until given a reason not to, and i don't talk about my bad stuff to anybody usually, <laughter>, not very because the same thing i've trained myself over the years to not talk about myself, i talk to other people i talk about them, uh let's see, my mother, gandy, um, bertrand russell, let's see, i'm not sure who else, other people i've had but i don't remember their names or they were teachers et cetera, earlier in life uh like i said uh stopping everything not completing things i regret very much, uh yeah, i coulda done better, probably the advice i gave myself to get off my butt and go learn and get an education uh and get on with my life do something , that i've survived, well i'm sixty five i've been sleeping in my car for a number of years i went from sleeping on pavement to where i got a car , while i've done that i've improved my credit rating i've gotten uh a number of jobs that i've been very happy with , i've had a lot of friends, both homeless <ho> people that are homeless and not homeless, and uh, i'm in pretty good health, and where as other people in my family have died young, so i guess that's about it, uh good jokes, uh people having a happy time, going and having a drink with somebody on occasional basis, uh about eight months ago was the last time when i had a beer with someone, let's see, probably uh, getting within one foot of a live wild deer, it was in uh green lake in washington, and i uh was out behind our house and this wild buck deer was walking in the field and i started motioning to it and it came within about one foot of me, and the only reason it left my dad drove down the drive way and it made noise and the deer ran off i was within petting difference distance of him and i wasn't to sure if should've petted him or not but i was about to <laughter>, as you, bye",5
403,"yes, i'm doing really good, i'm from granada hills california it's um the san fernando valley part of los angeles, i love the weather i like the diversity in people i like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's just not just one race or, kind of food i love the beaches, all the activities you could go do theme parks, aquariums stuff like that museums, the smog, um, there's a lot of creepy guys <laughter>, i've pretty much traveled around l_a i've been cross country and back three times twice was when i was seventeen, i like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live, um when i was seventeen i ran away with my boyfriend to upstate new york to watertown it was uh, like a navy army kind of town, we had an apartment there it snowed a lot, we sold antiques for a living, um getting passes press passes for the sunset strip music festival through a friend, and getting to meet rockstars and hang out at like the private parties, i'm very outgoing i love people, um i go to the gym and work out quite a bit i find it helps relieve stress and, keeps my energy level going i realized <rea> noticed if i don't work out a couple days i feel a little more tired than normal and, it just helps me feel good, i'm pretty good at it i'm very calm um i worked a lot of events and, jobs where you're dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm and, you know they're the customers so you have to make them feel wanted and, good and realize that you're getting paid 'cause the money they're spending so, i'm good at resolving <reso> resolving like consumer conflicts and stuff on the job, i had a drunk friend that was just, falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and i kinda, started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrasing and what she was saying to people was very mean you know, and i wonder like if you're talking to people like that, they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is l_a, i really don't feel guilty about anything decisions i've made in my life i've, think i've made really good decisions and i always stick with my moral compass what i'm doing i grew up in church so, i haven't gone in years but i still have those values and, you know the rules the ten commandments and stuff in my head, i had a slum lord landlord and um, i wish that i called you know the proper authorities and, followed through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code, i, a few years back i was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from, and after a few months you know he was coming to l_a and going back home i, decided to move there and i had just started, you know this business i was doing event planning was picking up and i decided to leave there, and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but, it was tough deciding like should i leave l_a and make this, jump and trace something new and experience something new or stay in what i was doing, i was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i was studying communications, like radio and television broadcasting and journalism, um somewhat i'm doing event work and i wrote for a magazine a couple years and i'm trying to like, get a website going and then have like where i'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of, you know writing <wri> writing for someone else, i always wanted to write and was always into the news and music and art growing up i really like connie chung, she was like a channel four newscaster in the eighties and i love barbara walters, i was a nerd no <laughter>, um my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family, and i have a good relationship with my mom um i never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me, i have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so i don't really talk to them on the phone we just communicate on facebook or like twitter, oh i go right to sleep, when i get tired i just go to sleep, pretty good energetic i've been motivated to go look for more event work you know event planning stuff and, really grinding in more than i was, i mean it's kinda hard 'cause you gotta talk to people and get them to trust you and, see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else, no, no, i mean i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone i know dies, i wouldn't say that i'm just, super like oh my god happy all the time but it's like an even, keel that i feel pretty good all the time, i'm very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and, i could adapt to different situations and even if i it's not my scene, or situation or group of people that i'm used to i could still jump in, talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt, i wanna make more money <laughter>, i remember in like second grade this people used to make fun of me 'cause i was very tall and skinny and i had like, straight a's one of the highest grades in the class so, people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or, stuff like that, very talkative she would just say that i talk to everyone, and that i'm very friendly and if you need help, that i'll help someone you know, oh recently i went up to oceanside and visited a friend i've known years and, we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and, we got her two year old son and like took him to the park and played and, it was really nice and it was cool visiting her i hadn't seen her in six months and, it was really fun and i wanna go again and, i like the area, mhm, i, guess maybe i could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people, i think i pursue it but i think maybe i could put a little more time a day into it, i don't really know anything like, that i would wanna erase or not happen, no i feel good about my choices i've made and i think i'm on the right path and, a lot of things i wanted to do then balls rolling and i'm getting <g> you know getting things done i'm not as big as i wanna be but i feel like i'm on my way there, um like ten years ago i would've told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as i was, um my friend we call mojo, um mojo has a magazine and i just wrote years and, he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball i'm rolling and, he's one of the biggest people you know in my life telling me you're talented, you could do it you know he's just a really, good like motivation for me, you know being published i've been on t_v shows and just getting my own event thing going and, i have a lot of people who read what i write every day and follow on i just think it's a you know it's not exactly kinda where i wanna be but it's a great start, and i worked to get to that point, great thanks",0
419,"yes, i'm good, thank you., around i was born in mexico city, yes, about thirty four years ago, yes <laughter>, i try to go back once a year, but i haven't been here for three years., i haven't had the time yet and i've traveled to other places, but i plan to probably go back next year., well, i can never see me retreating to mexico city, it's a huge city and, i like l a more there are more possibilities and, i feel like i'm at home here, my family moved here, as i said, i was very young and my parents moved to california to work, and then we just stayed here., i love traveling, i didn't travel as much as i'd like, but i love to travel., to see only new things that people from other countries meet.., feel relaxed and have no worries because you are on vacation, i love being easy, in other places, the last trip i made was a seven day cruise., and it went to saints thomas barbados saint lucia, um, saint martin, and it was amazing, i would love to do this journey again, um, i think going to mexico the last time i was there, i went to the pyramids teotihuacan and i had not been there in many years and it was just amazing to see, the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such large structures, i think i'm more shy., around in social situations i feel somehow uncomfortable, i'm not one to just, go to the people and start talking, when people come to me, of course, i'll talk to them, but i feel a little embarrassed., kind of out of place at a party, i've studied history., i've always been interested in history., and i just wanted to learn stories from other cultures and of course u s history, so i'm very much in history, i actually work in education., my dream job would actually be to travel around the world and have a show like the travel channel < laughter> that would be my dream job because i would be paid to travel and it's something i'd like to do, do, um, so i'd like to do this as a job, i love to read, and i love to take baths so relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bathroom, and i also like to go to the gym that helps me uh, dealing with stress and, it relaxes me, even if i train., um, i wasn't very good at controlling it when i was a kid, i would easily go crazy., and sometimes as an adult i still get angry, easy, but i've been much better at, try to think about things first before they say, and, without outbreaks, things like this, the last time i had a fight with someone, it was probably my best friend a week ago., and she actually has children i don't have., and for some reason she thought, or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and, she didn't do it and she's home with kids and you know i can do more things, i don't think i ever gave her the feeling that.., i and i definitely don't know how i feel better than them, but for some reason they accused me of it and we had an argument about it., um, i wish i'd handled differently, because, when she spoke to me, she was very upset and, i started pretty calm, just trying to argue with her and let her know that i certainly didn't feel like i was better than her, but towards the end of the conversation it somehow turned into a scream, match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and, maybe she asked me to call later, as soon as we calmed down, instead of just continuing the argument., i was angry at first, but once we hung up, i felt really bad about the situation., i thought maybe i could have just left her., omit all her feelings and then try to talk to her calmly, instead of yelling at them,, oh wow around, that's a tough thing, i think., god, i think one of the toughest decisions i had to make is the separation with a friend of seven years., um, although i knew it was the right thing to do i was, the fact that we were together for so many years and, i felt by ending the relationship., i would have wasted the last seven years of my life., it was a pretty hard decision to make, but i realized it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm really glad i did., because then i went on to meet myself, my husband, thank you., well, i'd say, maybe, fifteen years ago i was, with a few friends on one, association, and they met some guys and invited us to their house., and i really didn't want to go because i didn't know these people and i mean, i knew their names and that was it, but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving, so i decided to just go with them, and, back at her house around, one of the boys, actually pulled me into a room and, tried, i got scared i screamed, he tried to suffocate me and i thought, i wanted to die right there, i thought he was gonna kill me., but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door, because she heard me scream and we went, so, it could have been a worse situation, but i'm still thinking about it and i wish i could erase it from my head, it was, we have a pretty good relationship, i'm close, i have a sister and a brother., my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older, and we get out pretty well, my sister and i used to be best friends, but then we grew apart and now we're actually closer than ever., and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents, my father., still treats me like a little child sometimes < laugh> what annoys me, but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship, yeah, that's good., i usually wake up, a few times during the night, um, so, i think it's rare for me to sleep, all night long, um, and i feel a little bit, how tired in the morning, when i wake up, it's hard, i'm not a morning person definitely, um, so yeah, it's kind of hard to get a good night's sleep, i don't know., i've got a hard time falling asleep, and then sometimes i have bad dreams or, i have to get up to use the toilet., of course., i don't remember the last time i actually slept all night without waking up at least once., um, emotional good, i'm on vacation from work right now, so that's really nice., um, physically i feel good i haven't been in the gym for a while so somehow, gives me the feeling, bad because i like to train, but to be healthy, i'm good <laughter>, no, no, um, it was, last weekend i actually went out of town with my husband, we didn't go very far, we went to santa barbara., we really enjoyed ourselves around we went wine tasting and, went to the beach and just had a really good time, she would probably describe me as a good caring person., um, patients, very shy, um, she would probably also say that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors because i always do things for other people., well, yeah, that's how she'd describe me., i wish i were more absent, um, i wish that, i, what else is it?, in any case more outgoing, um, so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i'm very shy, i also wish i could have more patience than i did <laughter> sometimes i'm very close to patience, and i wish i could, find a better job so i could do more travel, um, yes i really have a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree, and i really wish i had, you know i took care of it a lot earlier than i did., um, and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend, i would have told myself to focus on school., go out and hang out and just, you know, and going to parties around wasn't as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first, i'm proud i haven't been to school for so many years., go to u c l a and get my degree, um, yes, that would be my most proud achievement, all right., thank you., see you.",3
432,"<synch>, i'm cool, fine, new york, yep, eh about six months, six months ago, nicer pace, uh photography job, it's a good move, mm, uh i love the weather, cool people, relax easy to talk to, uh,

the closest a safe path to go, so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think, an example hmm, well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect, okay, well example like uh traveling, sometimes you wanna go to a particular place, and it's uh, something great happening there, even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot, um, now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there <laughter> you know to do you know uh um, you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink, um, is that a good getaway spot still right now, something like that you know, mhm, mm, uh me i huh, i take walks, i call up a friend we have tea or something you know, uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control, mm eh, uh, it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much haven't fought again, i don't really dwell on, negative things too much, uh, um i don't have any regrets right now mm, i really can't think of anything right off the top, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, was uh, not hiring a good friend, uh for a job that, you know they weren't qualified for, that's hard, uh because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring it's their competence, my father, uh he just uh, taught me how to, you know uh overcome, uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up, uh, and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough, and i i found that to be true so, mhm, um, it's okay except <exce> except for some of my uh, my, distant siblings you know i don't see as often as i can, mm yeah, uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people 'cause <laughter> they're not always there you know, uh it's nothing like mhm yeah, mhm, uh, well you know i'm i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something or developing something so, i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that, you know when i when i'm out i'm out that's it, well uh, i guess i'll be a little bit uh, uh try and figure out how i'm gonna get sleep, you know as soon as i can to make up but um, uh i i try not to be uh grumpy or anything i just probably feel a little bit tired mm, i feel okay now, uh, changes like what, mm, well i i i see a more hopeful future you know and i see uh, i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes, no, never, uh i feel okay now, uh i went to a great party last week, that was really cool, yeah, well it was like on a rooftop uh, and a a lot to really uh, nice people, who are basically in the same kind of uh, mindset, uh pursuing the same type of uh uh goals, and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information, and a lot of good connections were made, mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome, my ideal weekend, is uh, cooking my own food relaxing, you know and, if i'm in the mood for company you know, i have friends and uh, you know uh family members join me, well, i'd kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work, i eat like crazy and nothing happen, mm, well you know i i think people in general sometime uh, uh misread <mis> misread you you know if you kinda like uh, if you look different or you're in <i> in a different type of a, if a different set of things, make you uh excited or you're into a different way of thinking, um people tend to misjudge you, you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime, but um yeah i'm i've kinda figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me, you know that's hey, maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me i've kinda worked those things out in time you know, yeah, uh my best qualities probably um, uh listening i think, <mumbling>, and uh, maybe just uh talking, uh you know on a conversational level, uh, yeah, sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that, but uh you know, i guess is that's probably one of the things that come with the turf so, when i <clears throat> when i see too much of that i just uh pull back, uh uh, go for your dream, believe in what you're doing, don't let anyone discourage you, and you'll be okay, and that's the way i feel now that it's uh kind of evolved itself, most proud of um, i think my um, my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about, not being too too anxious about, about <bout> things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen, and you shouldn't really uh, never allow yourself to be defeated i'm i'm proud to be able to have, arrived at that point, in my, my my thinking my framework, uh that i think that saved me a lot of uh problems that could've been uh differently, <mumbles>, very good questions, uh i, bye bye",1

314,"yes, very good., feel good, los engeles california here, mhm, one of the few, about born born los angelinos, i don't know., homeschool my ten year old son and uh, i am a homemaker i have five children and married twenty two years, mhm, so this is a full time job?, we could go to israel about two months ago., for a pilgrimage with our church yeah so i'd say yes i've traveled a little bit, uh good last we went to israel as we did two months ago for a pilgrimage we were about nine days and, it was fabulous that we spent the first five days in chorazin., which is near the uh, galilet, and in a place called uh uh, i mean, the name of the area is chorazin, but, uh we were in a place called adonis galilea that's a um, a house for the welcomed, to christian uh, pilgrims and jewish pilgrims, i enjoy how really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting people and of course seeing the story i mean above all israel i mean, it's the, it's totally old, but.., most of the people i enjoy are the people i think to get a better understanding of how different cultures around, live, no, not at all, just don't., i've known all my life that i've always been, open and ready to socialize and, i always remember my younger brother, i say i'd talk to everyone and i'll talk to everyone., just because i enjoy learning about other people, um, most of the time, like at the end of the day after i cooked dinner and we have dinner together as a family, there is a word game on the computer that i like to play for a while and then, to see t v have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax, that's what we're doing, and you know,, because we have a lot of work to do, we don't stay up too late., i like to watch crime dramas, um, really crazy probably not much to, i'm frustrated with my daughter, for example, not cleaning up her room, almost always, that makes me angry, but.., in terms of how really to, always how hotly angry i mean differently than like, little things my children do to you, especially my oldest child, who is twenty one, you know he can be so confrontational., except that nothing really makes me angry, i haven't felt it yet., contribution to society help uh, help, to educate responsible people, i guess, and of course the love and the affection and the, the fun and excitement that goes with him from all stages that go, i mean, like right now, i'm in a phase where my kids, are either adults or teenagers i have only an eleven years old and the rest are all teenagers and adults, so it is really funny because we are able to talk about current events and, all kinds of things that are going on in the world and you know have uh, challenging discussions and such things, so it's a different level than taking care of babies and, you know diapers change and stuff., the most difficult thing is that it's twenty four seven., um, you're never a parent, you know it's and so you have to accept it, and that's what i remember when i first, with my first child to, think you know when i brought him home from the hospital, that's it, i mean, there's no going back you can't, i mean, you could if you did something terrible, but.., i mean, under normal circumstances, you can't change that, and it's a permanent thing, and, um, it's.., in a way it takes away your freedom, but in another way it gives you a different kind of freedom, mhm, always, i'm sorry., i didn't understand what you said., some of the things that made a positive impact in my life most important was my church, around and my faith, but also my husband, he was really a.., he's kind of very, how logical thinking and very you know grounded, so when i get emotional or get upset about something, he's always, we'll balance each other if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him., it was a great gift in my life., i don't think i'd be categorized as someone with a temperament., sometimes i get angry sometimes, but i don't like it, rarely have i experienced outbreaks around, i'm more likely to know to tell you what i don't feel to allow it to build, so you know how my husband and i don't, rarely fight like have, arguments that, screaming and screaming or something like that almost never happens, because like i said, i'm more like a kind of person who communicates right now, so when i think something, i usually communicate it immediately instead of having it built., i usually argue with my older son because he, um, you know he thinks he knows everything., he is twenty one years old, so he has the knowledge, it's all mentality, and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know everything and, if life continues, he will learn more., he is very self confident and very self confident uh, even uh what is the word itself insured and so he thinks that you know that everything he does is right, and, he still has a lot to learn, that's all, mhm, it's it can be mhm, i think.., that many of them are around, pampered and live in an environment of uh, immediate satisfaction, um, what i think will be, to affect the future of this country, but.., you know that with all the technology we have, there's really no way to go back, so.., i hope that.., they will be taking, i mean, i think this country was built on uh hard work and ethics, and uh, we hope our next generation and the, generations after, can hold that to, i don't know if that's possible., mm to, loving care for, funny, we laugh a lot and around, carefully honest, things that uh, i mean, my best i've got, well, actually, my best friend is, there's two people, there's two sisters i grew up with, and.., we, i, for several years, cared for her mother who had alzheimer's before my parents got sick, so i had a very close, have a very close relationship with them still do, and so around i'm considered the fourth sister, so i'd say these are my best friends and.., we love each other very much, it's a good relationship., no, no, yes, most of the, mostly, mm minor depression it was more anxiety, uh, probably.., it's probably been five or six years, i mean, i had when out and over my whole life, but it was never originally diagnosed, as as a teenager i think is when i first started with the fear, but, um, except that i know you, so, depression goes with fear when it's not under control, but now it's under control., i've got a great one, what are you doing?, no, i think it was what they call free flee floating free floating fear more of one of uh organic, for reasons in other words, there was a chemical imbalance, in my brain, i felt pretty good, actually the holidays were great to, we had a, good family celebrations, a little stressed out because to, we make a big decision to help my parents, my dad's really sick., and we offered to move in with them, they have a big home, but we would have to do a lot, some renovation and some, to help and some obviously move around, and so we are in the throws of it and around, so that's a big change, but i'm looking forward to it because, i don't want my parents to be alone because they're in the '80s., as they get closer to death, i want my family there with them, um, usually not easy, all my life i think i've always been, i mean, i'm not i've always had.., at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night, um, going to the toilet basically, and uh, other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean differently than that i sleep well, but sometimes when i wake up like really early in the morning, then i can't sleep again i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then, go back to bed and, back to sleep idepends, which is my schedule and when the children are, must be early in school and there are a lot of factors, yeah, sometimes it does., mm, i think i could complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know, but.., i think, overall, probably the same, my children know that i'm going to tell myself kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful, she'll try to cook my other daughter dinner or something so you know, you can put in a little more pitch, not really, no, not really, nothing significant, what are you doing?, uh, actually, yes, i do., i have the feeling that therapy is useful, we had a problem with my daughter., um, she also suffers from fear and, we've had them in therapy for some time and we're just about to end, a group with her that was six months long.., uh, group for d b t it's called and it's like a, it's the first time they've documented it with teenagers for the first time., and, it was really good it was, very helpful it is just around, how to live at the moment and how to actually know physically and mentally, strategies to keep your uh you from, your mind of getting mad you know, worrying about things or you know, in this case, some of the children have tried to get themselves or whatever so, um, this is the focus of therapy and it was really good my husband and i both go with our daughter, and it was really.., really informative and really helpful, i think, oh my daughter was around her, in a bad way she was you know, suffer a lot and, we knew it and.., that's all we've done., um, for example , really joyful and happy i would probably say, if , it would probably be in israel if we renewed our marriage vows in the in knaan, you know where the wedding of cana took place, which was really moving and beautiful., and it happened that our wedding day was, on our anniversary day we flew to israel, so it was right at the same time, it was beautiful., very meaningful, and unlike that, i would say you know how, uh other joyful occasions were you know like christmas and you know family meetings and, you know my father's birthday was 80 years old., on christmas eve, you know that something like that, um, that's an interesting question, i'd say, um, as soon as i'm done like things i have to do, like when i'm, have a lot of tasks ch a lot of work to do the house or, running errands as soon as i finish, i feel like a feeling of performance, you know exactly what i mean, i've worked as an administrative manager at u c l a for many years., you know when you finish a project or you get your whatever end of month stuff done or if there are a lot of different things, you have to keep to the deadlines, there's a feeling i've managed to make you know., so i think that would be that you know the most for me.., last, um, how to feel good and how to feel, how feeling reaches, dream job hm, i think i've already lived it, i'm also a birth doula, and, yes and um, so i've visited a lot of births and now i'm really just doing it for family and friends, and it's the most rewarding thing that you might ask to be involved in, the birth of the new life into this world so, i'd say that's probably, was my dream job and i didn't know, i've trained a lot after you know i've done my management stuff and.., was awesome it is and was awesome so i no longer work in a hospital, the hospital i worked in is now closed., but.., like i said, i do it for family members, um, i happened to be with a friend of mine., she uh she had the same o b as i had with all my kids, and, i came to bring food for her husband when she was at work, we were you know, close friends, and, she wanted me to stay, and she didn't want me to leave., i didn't plan it, so that was the first birth i had participated in outside of you., what is a completely different experience, so after that i was really interested in studying possibly un nurse midwife, but then i discovered this thing called a doula that really gives you, even much more hands on uh one on a contact with the patient what i like, so i trained to do this at a hospital in inglewood, about fifteen years ago, for my son is fifteen, and he was one year old he was not sixteen a year old., so, um.., yeah, that's good., and i was, um, now it can be difficult in terms of hours, it depends on how long the woman is at work, but, uh and you also know how, for me i always tell my friends and my family if they want me to be their doula, that i can't guarantee 100 i don't do it for business, and so and that's why i don't like doula's back, which, if i'm sick or not available, can fill someone else for me, but so far, all the women who asked me, i could be there for some reason, so.., um, the only one i missed was a friend of mine from church, and she wanted me to go with her second baby., i was with her at first, but the labors went so fast that she didn't even call me laughter , it was in the middle of the night like she was like, she wouldn't have two hours of work if she had called me, i wouldn't have been there in time laughter , so, um.., it was really fast, but unlike the, you know., yes, i was able to visit all the births of people who asked me to do, um, throughout your life or in your job, probably my own birth, i mean the birth of my own children, um, as if there were an extreme, feeling of joy excitement relief, because you are naturally out of the pain, and then it's like it's just a question from you., from there it goes on, but it is, it's like something you can't explain, it's just fantastic., after birth, and i have experienced both ways that i have made both., natural and, my last child was about c section, so i had both, both experiences, um, i had a kind of crazy nurse with my third child she was a little bit, psychotic, but otherwise we're laughing about it now, but when i was in labor, it wasn't funny, and around them, she wasn't there when the doctor i mean it was my third child, born very quickly after he broke the water and oof, my husband was there, but she wasn't the doctor yet and she got a lot of trouble, because after that i had only two contractions, my daughter was born in bed, so it was great for me because i didn't have to go through any of the contractions, but, i'm sure they weren't happy., then fill out a lot of paperwork, so, now i would give mysef for ten or twenty years, um, ten or twenty years ago, i was probably more, not like.., don't relax like.., how i now feel at my age that, i don't have the same worries i have then i don't worry about, i'm not worried at all about what people think about me, i'm not worried at all about what, you know, you know, like i said, my daughter, oh mom, you can't wear this because people are gonna say that, i'm just saying i don't care., you know, but they do, because it's still in their minds that this oh mama you have to dress like that and dress like that, whatever it is., so it would probably be the wisdom you reach with age,, you see how life is so many things that are more important in life than worrying about small things, what you are most proud of in your life, very proud of the, probably my family my husband and my, my children, i mean the fact that we stayed married, that we, we are a tactical family that, um, my children see every day how, their friends who come from divorced families or single parents and, for , they actually express, gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still know that we are still a family, so i'd say that's probably it, um, probably the, one of my best qualities is, uh, be able to listen to people and be able to, don't be judgmental., through the years i had a, a lot of experience with around, people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from the church and, it just taught me that.., everyone has weaknesses everyone has problems, and i don't think i'm better than anyone else, if you think you're better than someone else, it's usually a sign to me that you don't know yourself well enough., all right., all right., goodbye.",1
468,"<synch>, yes i'm okay with this, i'm pretty good feeling a little tired but uh, feeling pretty good for the most part, um redondo beach, yep, i like the beach i like the mountains i, love how you could go surfing in the morning go snowboarding in the day, um, i like to go hiking up in these mountains santa monica mountains to be exact, i don't like the traffic, i don't like the congestion of people here, and i don't like, the price of <o> the cost of living in specific areas, uh i've been trying to actually um, last year was the summer of, really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend um, we're looking to go to costa rica and hopefully to south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip, down the south see some of the southern states, but uh i've been to canada i've been to mexico and ecuador and, been to various states here and there, trying to get out there, i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different <diffing>, different foods that are native to that local area, and, it's just part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know, this planet we call earth, um just recently we went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and uh, it was gorgeous we uh flew into seattle, and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and, headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy was it gorgeous just, very lush beautiful trees the uh, the climate was nice the ocean was right there it was people were great it was just a fun trip all around, yeah, <deep breath> <sigh> one of my most memorable <sigh> memorable experiences, was probably the uh, the trip we took to colorado last summer, and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver, and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people who were living there and um, just the day before we had to uh contacted them and telling 'em we're coming in the area, and they were just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport let us crash at their place for a couple days we, even let us use their car to explore the state and go to wyoming and, see the, the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and, it was just everything worked out very well just every day was there was something new and fun to do, yeah, i uh i studied business management, and uh economics right now, um i've always wanted to, own my own business and i figured management be a, a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to, see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um, and then economics is just to, just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and, start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics, yeah i'm really stoked it was, one of the best decisions probably of my my life, yeah, i consider myself more outgoing i'm, i'm pretty friendly i don't mind to open up to people and stuff, <sigh> i like to be outside like to go hiking, i like to go um working out at the gym but, i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just, just puts me at ease, from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there, i uh, it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay, angry and hold grudges just 'cause, there's no need to life's too short for all that, um, see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody, i have no idea, probably when my uh, my brother and my girlfriend got in a little, little argument, uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um, i wish i would've just handled it, right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and, told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution, but now it's just, awkward, yeah it does, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, man that's a toughy, i don't think i've had too many, tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um, maybe, not moving to colorado for my undergrad, two three years ago, was a little tough just 'cause i kinda think what if, but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that, was really that hard of a decision, i don't really feel guilty about anything, pretty good person i think and for the most part, i couldn't think of anything, something i could wish i could erase from my memory um, nothing really to be honest i, i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part, i know that's kinda, weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and, i'm happy, yeah, uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's, it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month, but uh when i see 'em it's, it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and, it's not that i don't mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh, it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult, mm, my girlfriend's family uh, they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction, just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about, really thinking long term, and uh just seeing them <th> them and, what their family does and, how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to, and they've been very successful they own their own uh, accounting practice and, seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life, yeah, it's pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and, wake up in the morning, i'm tired sometimes i'm, could sense that i'm a little drained and uh, maybe get a little groggy here and there, and that's it, feeling pretty good for the most part a little, stressed out just 'cause finals are uh next week, and uh i really really wanna do well and just you know close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks, and um, for the most part that's that's the only thing i'm really nervous about but for the most part i'm really excited i'm looking forward to, going to maui for a week after graduation i'm fired up i'm fired up to, see what the future holds where we gonna live <l> me and my girlfriend gonna live and, what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just i'm excited to be done with school for a little while, yeah, i have never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, i've never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>, the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday, and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through, the nursing program for five and, it's just, seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her, yeah, probably outgoing friendly, positive vibes all around, adventurous, loves sports, team player knows how to be a leader here and there, and uh, gets a little outspoken sometimes, no not really for the most part, no not really, just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just, maybe 'cause i'm just done with school and i'm over it that i just don't feel as motivated, but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined, right now and that's not, i'm not going that way right now so, mhm, no biggie, <sigh>, oh man i couldn't, can't really think of a time, i went caving two weeks ago, that was a lot of fun, uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a, for an r_t_m class it's like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh, sequoia and just, me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes, it was a lot of fun, that was, yeah, ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school, a little less on the social aspects, and uh, kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya, um <sigh>, sometimes not playing hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and um, and that's pretty much it now, i'm proud <sigh> that uh i'm really proud that i'm graduating getting my bachelor's and i'm, looking to get a full time job i work at a law firm now so i have something going for me um, i'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person long term wise <w> long term thinking wise i'm a well-rounded person, and i really wanna explore the world so i'm kinda proud that i opened my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and, really have a open mind to people and rather than judging 'em you know it's liberty why not let 'em do what they want, and uh, i'm really proud to just be finally getting my bachelor's and hopefully going for my m_b_a in a couple years, for sure, bye",4
352,"yes, i do it pretty well <laughter>, i'm from oklahoma., mhm, yup oklahoma city, uh the weather is great i love it near the ocean and palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter>, it was pretty easy, there are a few differences it is a huge city compared to where i'm out of so traffic is definitely an adaptation for me <laughter>, i just wanted to live in california. i hate being locked up in oklahoma. i just wanted to go to the west coast near the ocean., i studied psychology and minor art, no, not right now., i think i misunderstood your question, but i'm not working on my degree yet, but i'm working on psychology., my dream job oh, i don't really know, i think i just want to help people, but i can and um, i like to work with people in the field of psychology, so i think i might already have my dream job <laughter>, to relax i like to read or watch movies around i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends, things that really drive me crazy.. probably injustice to other people, people who are abused or abused and people who are lied and deceived, including myself, i hate to be lied to <laughter>, when i'm upset uh depends on the situation, but, i'm just trying, how to count to ten and take a deep breath and let my emotions react to me in a negative way, so i'm just trying to calm down before i say anything, um, it depends again on the situation and how i'm angry at around most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it, but sometimes i think like, like most people i turn to the people i'm closest to times and and these moments i'm not so good at controlling it, when was the last time i had a fight with someone?, it was probably with my parents., i've been having some problems with the car lately and, i'm also slow with money, so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly, but i'm sure we probably fought over the fact that, i know that i have to take care of my own <laughter> things like car problems., i'm very close to my family, they're still in oklahoma, but i'm talking to them on the phone all the time, oh definitely i mean, my mom, i think she's probably the person i'm closest to and she's just, she's a great role model, she's a wonderful person and she's very diligent and very selfless and i just want to be like her., oh, probably the time i went bungee jump over the nile river in uganda, i still have flashbacks from this moment, just falling free, it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy, so it was a funny time <laughter>, yes, well, i've travelled a lot these days, i'm not travelling that much anymore, but i've been working for a cruise line around norwegian cruise line and so i'd go, travel with them all the time and then i also have an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped in different third countries it was really cool, uh i love to go to different places, see new places and meet all different types of people around, because it is easy to simply be included in your own little bubble that you forget that there is a huge world and there is, all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet these types of people and just see the, diversity and the terrain of the earth also and the way the earth looks in different places is cool, no, i didn't serve in the military <laughter>, yes, no, i've never been formally diagnosed, although i'd say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression just after studying it a lot in psychology, during the years i've been, i'm probably ninety nine percent sure i've struggled with depression from time to time, so yeah, lately it's been pretty easy, but over the years i've definitely had a lot of problems with insomnia around just like either not being able to fall asleep, or just as constantly waking up all night and so now i'm not really experiencing too much of it, but in the past it's definitely an ongoing topic for me, i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely important to me i think maybe more than a lot of people i like need good sleep to work, i feel really good., in the last few months, i've been unemployed after i got out of here and, this was really tough around and i just offered my job around just like last week, so i definitely think i've gone through, a lot of crap and just a lot of depression, but it's like i've picked up a lot of it because i don't have that pressure anymore, how will i end up hitting this city really expensive and i don't have a job and, so i feel much more relieved than i had the feeling that's good <laughter>, i mean, just like i said last week, or so i've become a lot more., positive i was kind of like a feeling like a hermit in a way it's just hard to be like in a new city and not really know too many people and, of course, as i said, not having a job leads to, type of, like in your own bowl i think, and that was kind of like it was like it was like it was like for me and just since i got the job offered i just got so much more, trust and like positivity that things start to train for me, which is good <laughter>, oh, it was probably a few days ago actually i was going around, i went to explore a part of the south bay that i hadn't really been before and, it was i just wanted to go on a jogging along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and, it was just beautiful and then i went for a ride of this kind like cliff, where there is beautiful scenery that i've never seen before and i just, how overwhelmed was how beautiful it was and i was just like oh i can't believe i can live here, so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter>, my best friend would probably say that i am very daring and, bold and fearless about, that i am unique, and artistic, and i wouldn't suspect that she would probably say that i'm a non conformist, i don't really think the way many people do and i question everything that can be a good or bad thing, but yeah < laugh>, um , likely, just like, the fact that i really try to live my life with no regrets and just try to make a very, exciting life in a way and i think that especially since i finished college and travel as i have and, i've tried to move all the different places from myself, so i just think the fact that i'm not really afraid that i'm not letting things hold back i just want something or if i want to do something, i can just do it and, i think in a way i like that about me and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do what i want, even though it's hard i'm still proud that i've overcome a lot of these fights, oh, there's like little things i regret all my life, but there's nothing really important, because i think pretty much everything i've done, i've learned whether it's good or bad so, i wouldn't change anything., oh,, i'd say i'd tell myself when i was a kid that i, should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything someone says stop me from believing that anything is possible because, um, i guess when i grew up to be an adult, i really saw and started to believe that really everything is possible and if you really want something, you can go after it and you can get it, so i would just, tell me never to give up and just always believe that you can do whatever you want., oh , let's see, that's kind of tough <laughter>, um, i guess,, i recently went home for christmas back to oklahoma and to see some of my friends from college i hadn't seen in some of them i hadn't seen how since, i graduated so much as four years ago., it was really great, just going out with them and we went to dinner and we went out later and had only a good night and it was really really fun, cool, you're welcome., see you.",10
385,"yes, all right, how are you?, the angels, weather, entertainment, transport, no, also <t> too many people, enterprises, uh just fun to do, yes, about nothing much to talk about, maybe i'll talk to you., to be fairly good environment, pretty good, the centre, sleep, i don't know., i don't remember., no, nothing., i don't know i can't remember., to bad people, you only know bad people who put things back, car accidents, mm does not know any of them, i don't really know,, no one., no, no, something fine, just waking up thinking, no, i don't know., no, i don't know., i don't remember., i don't know how to talk to you., the first time i've done this before., i have no idea., sleep, not too much, nothing, i have no experience., i don't know if i'm sure., to be just a nice person, not safe, not much, no, i don't know., i don't know., i don't know., sporting, basketball, last month mm, goodbye.",8
380,"sure, i'm fine i'm doing alright um, yeah, i'm from maryland, yeah, from maryland washington d_c area, uh like five weeks ago, maryland um <deep breath> it's a lot it's a lot less um, uh it's a uh it's not as nice this time of year it's more um, uh it's it's good it's nice it's um, l_a's a lot better though it's a lot it's a lot more people lot more going on, um i'm still <st> i guess i'm still getting used to it so, um, it's, it's not like um, yeah i'm still getiing used to it it's it's coming slowly but but surely, i live in culver city, i do i have one, uh it's okay it's i live in a really nasty house it's uh it's cheap <chea> it's cheap 'cause i'm living in a friend's place, um, and uh, but but and he's letting me stay there for half price but the the actual like place itself is pretty horrible <horr> horrible living conditions <laughter> but i'm moving soon so, i can't see your shoes actually, uh but no i i travel i would say i i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything, i enjoy the chance to get to like see other, um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the, the specificity of my own, you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um, i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing, mhm, uh okay um, hmm, putting me on the spot here ellie, um, let's see, uh, well um i, it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess, one of the last trips i did was to um, i mean it a like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw, but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole, like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally, it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um, unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so, so um, uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal, hmm, it's a tough question um, one <on> um, i uh, hmm, you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that, yeah, come back to it, yeah, that's what i just said, film, you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know, i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys, and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls, um, and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and, at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um, like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in, playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film, like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always, i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like, um, and uh and i never, uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was, fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars, the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck, and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so, i'm not really sure uh, yeah it's it's it's, um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film, but, uh i've always been fascinated by like, how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general, i am yes, um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct, and uh put <pu> put together, and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make, movies, uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the, all the processes but, i guess the best parabole for that would be a director, directing, well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them, um, my, i guess um, it's funny you should ask ellie um, i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't, when away, like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like, i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like, of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like, um thinks positively about me, um so it's i have like a, a complicated relationship with my parents, i mean <mea> and my family in general, well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like, um, i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um, i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like, uh, or inhibited person maybe um, so i like to like, until, yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it, um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed, so now i you know i have a glass of wine and, maybe watch a movie, um, i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an if it's um, if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like, then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might, go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like, you know competitive sports and hiking, pretty good, well i always like arguing um, i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper, um, i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um, but i don't, as long as my like, 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks, uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject, um, and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think, um, one of my weaker points i would say, but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question, um, what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate, hmm, the last time i had a heated debate, was um i had a heated debate about, uh the movie boogie nights, um, i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about, 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the, like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie, um, they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um, they have a certain uh they think that the, like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like, complexity of character within the movie, and um, that somehow like, <sigh> um, what what were they saying they were saying like the movie, it like it's like the end of an era, which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they, how they interact in the plot, um, kind of like, uh, yeah i guess, i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's, the um, i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i, i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like, in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it, um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool, um, the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but, but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained, and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie, and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like, so in the movie django unchained, um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big, the, big purpose of the movie is, and um, and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh, who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he, was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django, or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera, and um, and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not, sacrifice themself for someone else, um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like, um, like who, uh like, she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that, altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist, um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself, um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like, every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor, in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um, purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate, um, and uh, somewhat like yeah and it's it uh, so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um, i think of losing my temper as being more, um, like i just, so <s> i i would so <s>, revert to um ad hominem like attacks, uh but i i didn't like that's not um, maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like, well you're an idiot, you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort, yeah i'm glad you understand, an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments, not, stories um, like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so, yeah, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, oh geez, could it just be one of the hardest decisions, hmm, um, like choosing between two things that it's like, i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between, two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life, but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um, and uh but i had to do it, for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends, were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world, and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't, i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think, it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back, to new york within like a month or two, uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could, leave new york, it was how hard was that, or how hard is, how hard was that, um, it was hard, <laughter> um, it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like, isolating isolating <is>, 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends, and uh, that had kind of gone extremely, badly, and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole, everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of, saw it at the time so i didn't like, you know just being socially isolated etcetera, yeah, well recently it's been awful, um, i uh, i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours, um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams, but previous to that night, so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep, um because i was working on set and i would get back, and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um, too much riled up energy or something i i don't know, tired uh, very, not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning, and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so, um, i guess, with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go, um without caffeine it's, i'm just i'm just quieter i guess, more introverted, since, like lately as in when, um, change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like, eh at the beginning where the, the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends, and the the push to, to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um, overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like, coming to terms with that um, and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just, you know, you you know <sigh> you know <sigh>, no i just, nope, the last time i felt really happy, might have to reach back, um, i think the last time i felt really happy, was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie, um co-wrote co-directed co-produced, um, and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the, writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up, eat breakfast, bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative, full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and, and there's like probably like a a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like, just like, i felt like it yeah i guess that was the, the last time that was that was like, eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like, you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like like can't, it's too much else to do so, i would say that i'm very, accepting <acce> like, accepting of other people, and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um, and, open <o> open <ope> like, excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and, yeah um, hmm, um, i guess i wish i was less uh, uh, less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my, you know, everyday interactions and in my like, um, you know, zest for for living, um <sigh> yeah i , i other things i would change about myself i'd, i would, i don't know <laughter>, hmm, really badly about myself, um, i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like, uh, like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um, some sort of uh, conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always, always on the other side of the court you know like never, it was i i noticed, or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were, like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with, like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which, um i was like blamed or like you know, it was my it was my fault um when, when what i was doing like, yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like, there's no yeah i don't know, yeah, ten years ago um, stay stake you know like i i think that there's um, i have a tendency to, like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes, um, ideas are too easily i would just say like do as much as possible like don't, don't decide that you um, are only going to do, one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums, would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to

365,"safe, i'm fine., new jersey, yes, three months ago, not very often, it's a lot different., uh, i don't know, it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here, to start a new life for me, it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh, it was.., it was pretty hard at first, but i'm still trying to get used to life here., i met some good friends here., um, you know, i love the hollywood area around, and only you know the mountains are beautiful, they're kind of things i love, hmm, transport, not really no i don't, just didn't have the time or the finances to, digital media, all right., i've always loved you., < deep breath> computer and you know to design things and uh i don't know that i somehow fell into it, no, i got out., well, i guess my dream job would work in something that, uh i went to school for you know i've never really completed my education, um, but i guess it would be great if i went, you know it back to school, and you know, ready you know my, completion in digital media, and you know i'm done., and uh started working you know something to do in this area, a little of both you know that sometimes i can be shy, but, i like to push myself to leave me, you know it's a fight for me, but, i don't want you to know it in a shell, so i kind of force myself to be out, i hear music sometimes i just drive and around, you know, playing music in my car and that helps me relax, or i smoke a cigarette, oh like what oh um <laughter>, just heavy metal, that's all i hear is metal., good <sigh>, it's all about it., how high my stress level is and how angry i am, but i, i'm doing my best to, not so pissed on <laughter>, , and, i don't know if she's.., she wanted me to pick her up., she was a little drunk., and uh we somehow fought over the phone all over some other things and, i just didn't pick her up., because of her attitude on the phone with me, yeah, that's good., it shall , something i feel guilty about is not talking to my children, common, or as often as i should, i was just so busy trying to, i don't really have time to find my way around here., you know i talk to my kids as much as i want., you have no idea, um, it comes naturally, but it's not easy, and it's the hardest job i love to do, but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away, and i made this choice to come here, and i feel bad that i don't see them you know, but, the reason i got out of here was to improve myself so i could take care of her., anxiety, you know, fear <f> only fear you will know that you are afraid of what will happen to your children you fear, the, something terrible is going to happen, and, they do not see, brings forth this fear much more, you know, and i can't always be there with them, i can't see them, you know, it wasn't that bad when i lived in florida., um, and i at least saw her, it wasn't very often, but i used to see her, now i don't see her at all, and, that's the hardest thing i've had., doing as a parent, is, get away from my kids if i just don't know for a while how long i'll be here., i don't know what my future will bring, but, the hardest part is,, so far away from them, only the joy they bring me, i mean, i could have a bad day, and they're just firing me up, i mean,, i eh, it's annoying to be away from them for so long, and they're so far away, and do not see their faces,, it's the worst thing you've ever known., but, i, i love to see their faces that just bring a smile to my face, and, i don't know., well, um.., i think, the fact that i can, up to their level, um, i'm a little silly <laughter>, as a father, when my father was with me, my father was, you know, strictly safe all the time that he knows you, laugh and play with us, but, you know he was always very reserved., you know, and he held a lot, he held a lot of his emotions just because, you know he was a strong, very tough guy., um, but with me i am very silly and stupid with my children and i am strict when i have to be, but, i always love it, you know you're playing around with them., as much as possible, you don't know, i don't want them growing up too fast., and that this may, yeah, that's good., good <sigh>, a situation i wish i had treated differently, there are so many <laughter>, uh, i guess when i was still with my ex wife, in florida, i wish i hadn't, got so angry or i wish i hadn't let her get the best out of my emotions, she had a tendency to, go under my skin, and you know it, pick me until i'm ready., i exploded., and, i allowed her to do that., you know, i just would've, left when i could, and you know i can't get the best of myself., no, sometimes it's hard., um, sometimes i just lay awake in bed you know, thinking all the things going through my mind all you know, all the stress that i'm going through, with work and you know, ensure that , you know, i wonder if i'll be able to give you the rent?, you know what my kids are going through?, do you know when i'll see her again if she even takes care of me?, when they know they have a father, you know, these are some of the things that run through my mind and, and that sometimes stops me at night, a little <sigh> but <sigh>, you know i got into this situation., you know i have to, you know i have to take it., you know that you reap what you sow, so i <sigh>, i have to deal with this my way., lately, um, i tried to, don't think so much about, you know everything that goes into my life, i'm trying to distract myself, and this kind of, get me in a better mood, you know if i'm hanging out with friends or, look at something to get me distracted by you., all the burdens in my life, um, the last time i felt really happy, uh, was actually a few nights ago i went drinking around, with some of my friends from work and around, i don't know., we just.., pretty drunk and simple <laughter>, that kind of helped me forget, all the crap that was there., before went through my head, so if i can distract myself, if i can forget all this, other material, then i am happy <sigh>, some of my best qualities i think i'm convinced <laughter>, um, i'm kind of like a, i guess you'd say a consultant to some people you know some of my close friends, you know, i like to persuade people to do things they can regret, or i mean, i'm sorry to talk to people about things they might regret in the end., or i can, you know you only listen to people so you know., i could say that you know that i definitely know you're listening to my friends and helping them in their time of need when they're going through something., scary times like i'm going through, , uh who lives in florida, you know i talk to him every once in a while and, he's having trouble with his girlfriend and, you know i'm just kind of, to talk to him about his problems and listen to me mostly <mo> i hear mainly because you know that i don't think he has anyone else to listen to., do you know when i was living in florida?, i was very close to him so you know he always relied on me., and now that i'm here in l a, i don't want to lose you knowing the connection to him, because i mean, i've always been there for him, so.., he.. he.. he.. he.. he.. he.. he.. he.. he.., he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him advice, you know what i think you know he should., um, so i think, <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad he knows you rely on me for that, he trusts me enough to tell me all this., i don't know., sometimes i wish i wasn't like that, kind or generous, it seems bad, but sometimes i don't know that people can take advantage of me, and i can't see it, and, i don't like to say no to people i like, people always to please, so if i can change that maybe i wish i hadn't fallen such a people, sometimes financially in difficulty <laughter> <low breath> sometimes i know, you know, help others and don't know you, that can break me sometimes yes i can not have enough to, paying invoices, but, i feel better to help people, i don't know., i regret, not, breaking up with my ex wife earlier, i regret <re> i regret <re>, because she's been through so much crap in my life, and, i've always tried, be a people i like, i tried to please her., you know, try,, please my children as much as i can, by not dissolving, you know the family, but, you know, there's only so much a person can take., and i probably think if i left earlier, i could have been happier, and things may not have gotten as out of control as they have done., you know, during all the years with her, so, maybe if i got out early., i don't know that i would have been happier, i guess., um, it's okay to be selfish., it's okay., you know, sometimes think of yourself, you know when you keep putting everyone in front of you, then you don't think about yourself, you don't think about what makes you happy, and even if, falling people may make you happy, uh you sometimes have to think about yourself and your needs, because, you know, they play an important role, in, the life of your close family members, and, to keep everything above water, sometimes you have to worry about the one person who, you know you juggle everything and stop everything you're yourself., be a little selfish sometimes it's okay, i don't even know what a weekend is anymore., my ideal weekend would be, alone locked up in my room, watching movies that only listen to music, with my, turn off mobile phone and, you don't know you're with someone or it could be at a bar, you know or know you see a metal show, so, i like being alone, but sometimes i want to go out with others, as you know i'm with people., crazy <laughter>, he thinks i'm.., i'm crazy because i got out of here., but, i guess he'd say i'm committed and i'm strong minded, and that you know what i imagined, i can do it, you know it, no matter what., how hard it is that i won't freak out, so, i mean, i really respect him for giving me his insight., but i guess, yeah, i guess he'd say that i, crazy, but, strong minded <laughter>, my children <sigh>, you know, this is the one thing that brings me joy that you know as real joy., are my children and, you know, having her in my life is the, the proudest thing i can ever achieve is that you know that she's, in my life, and even though i don't see her so much, even though i'm thinking of them, they're just thinking of you., how far they've gone, you know, what they have achieved in their you know, in her short time i mean anyway it makes me happy, and i can't wait to see her again, one of my most memorable experiences, i guess that would be, , in florida, you know to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch, it was a great night overall you know, one of the night i'll never forget, just because we were looking forward to you knowing so many months and, you know, when it finally happened, it was surreal., um, it was a great night after all and overall, sure that you are welcome, see you.",12

different today, um, my grandmother she's always been a um a a positive influence uh she's a great black woman um with a old school um, ways of living so um i think i i i've added that to my life she's a great woman, , in baseball and um, yeah <laughter>, um i was a pretty good player i was a pretty good athlete growing up um i was one of the top, , and uh that started a future in in athletics and that's what i wanted to do so i accomplished my goals so at the time it was a great a great thing and it still is a great thing it's a great accomplishment in my life , um <sigh>, accomplishments being able to if i or if i'm , have a goal or, or something i'm supposed to do that week or that day and i accomplishment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and i the way i'm supposed to do it in a in a timely fashion that always puts me in a good mood, um, being a positive role model right now um for younger kids that's in um our sports academy program i i think as i got older, the thought process and um the way i look at life has totally changed and, i think i a lot of kids can look up to me that i deal with now and say you know that's somebody that, that is is a positive <po> a positive influence in my life, oh um, couple days ago my football team um we're in the playoffs made the playoffs so that always makes me happy, thank you, thank you, bye bye",2
341,"sure, i'm doing fine just a little tired, california, yes, um the weather, <laughter> not last week but yeah the weather <laughter>, fear of earthquakes, psychology, i am, i go to harbor college, i am, um wish i would've went sooner but better late than never, probably, i'm not sure i haven't really thought about it i wanna work in the field of psychology but i'm not sure if i wanna work with children or adults so i haven't really decided , no <laughter>, i don't know, i just don't, maybe once a year, um june actually i went to uh orlando florida, sometimes, yeah not as, i'm sorry, um, watch t_v read a book, talk on the phone, mhm, mad, mm <sigh>, my mom gets in my business <laughter>, other than that um, i guess just frustrations with my son, no <laughter>, um the hardest thing is um, raising a child with a disability, not knowing how you can help him, it is it's very hard, i don't sugarcoat it at all, just having my children, they're a blessing i love 'em <laughter>, with all the good and the bad it's a part of me and i just love the fact that i'm helping mold them into , good human beings <laughter>, we're really close, i mean my family's small we live within blocks of each other but yeah we're close , good or bad, <laughter>, most memorable, just giving birth for the first time it was just amazing, my son is nine now so i still remember it like it was yesterday, <laughter>, like i was, being born again myself i don't know how to explain it it just very, emotional <laughter>, i don't know <laughter> i guess i have a lot of regrets but, none that i really wanna mention i guess <laughter>, stay in school <laughter> don't get emotionally involved, and um let people, deter you from your goals <laughter>, oh yeah, definitely, did you wanna move on, i'm okay i mean i'm pretty easygoing , for the most part i don't really have a temper per se, things frustrate me more than they anger me, , oh that's easy <laughter> with my mother she's like um, i guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to, socialize <laughter> she feels that, i'm married with children so i should stay at home, like ninety nine percent of the time, and i wanted to go out and socialize with some ex co-workers, and she, basically, kinda put me down for it as if i don't spend enough time with my children <laughter> , it does, and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her, because i always think gosh i don't wanna get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day, but, she gets kinda intrusive <laughter> i don't know <laughter>, oh i know um after the semester ended when i noted that i , you know i did well in school 'cause i had been it had been a long time since i went to school so, when i received my grades you know a and a b i was like wow okay i can do this and it made me happy, and that was about, a few weeks ago i guess mhm, thank you, my mom i know it's good and bad <laughter> i mean for the most part my mom's been a positive influence you know it's just sometimes, you know she gets a little, like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm gonna make my own decisions now and , pretty much have to let me do what i need to do, <sigh> a lotta , heavy breathing <laughter> i mean i walk sometimes when i get a lil' frustrated whatever i'll just go take a walk, you know or um just try not to think about it, thank you <laughter>, yes, yes, the navy, i was nineteen, yeah, <laughter> yeah, i didn't have any other options, <laughter>, i am i probably should've stayed in a lil' longer i was only in for four years but , you know i wanted to experience life outside the military so i did my, enlistment and then i got out, it made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military i can notice a big difference as far as you know how i live my life and how they live theirs, um just made me a little bit more responsible, thank you <laughter>, i worked in the medical field for about five years, and uh, oh thank you <laughter>, but um it wasn't for me i wanted to do something lil' bit different i didn't wanna do patient care i wanted to work with people but not necessarily as a patient care, provider so, i started going to school and then i met my husband i stopped going to school, got married and i started working in a telecommunications field, and then we you know conceived our child and after that, you know <laughter>, <laughter>, i think i'm caring well i know i am i'm very caring you know i'm very honest to a fault sometimes you know i try to, be as honest as possible with people, sometimes it can hurt their feelings but you know you gotta be honest you can't let people, think that you know, you're not trusting, and if, mm yeah probably i don't i never really thought about it, i don't know, <laughter>, maybe i don't really think about it i just try to be the best person that i can be, you know so, all i can do i can't live for what other people think i can only do what i need to do <laughter> , um, i don't know, <laughter> i never really thought about it , i guess it just you know being around my kids you know i just love being around my children, and that's always puts me in a good mood <laughter>, thank you, okay like i said a lil' tired you know but, you know for the most part okay you know i'm dealing with situations that, well i go to bed really early so, long as i go to bed early i get a good night's sleep but i wake up early as well so, <laughter> it's kinda like, good and bad a lil' bit i go to bed like eight eight thirty and then i wake up at like one one thirty, so, <laughter>, very moody, very irritable short short-tempered i guess, if anything i think i'm thinking more positively, you know like i said especially with my son having a disability you know i i look at it as if you know, it's not all bad, i mean he has challenges eh but i'm dealing with them a lot better, you know as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know i'm just finding more avenues to work with him you know, different resources to help him as opposed to just feeling guilty or sad and depressed about it, thank you, no, occasionally, who doesn't <laughter>, i don't know can we skip that question, <laughter>, <sigh> green <laughter> seems to be the word kinda like um, yeah probably green like, naive a little <laughter>, but at the same time smart i think she'll describe me as smart , mhm, yeah, okay, no problem, bye",7
333,"yes, very well , new york , just turn the volume up a little bit , <laughter>, uh for a change, yeah it's good , i wanted <wa> i wanted to, i wanted to see what los angeles was about , um probably took a year or two , uh you know being away from my family being away from, what i was used to in new york the neighborhoods the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here, uh the weather , you can't beat the weather it's generally always nice it's not too hot it's not too cold, uh it's creative i do like uh you know movies , uh like the beach , the traffic, it's a lot of traffic, uh , some of the sometimes i think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places , i was a history major , no, uh i do uh demonstrations in really <rea>, uh high-end supermarkets, uh to be a screenwriter , that's one of the reasons why i came to los angeles , um it's hard 'cause i don't always maintain uh focus and motivation, i let other things distract me, <laughter> , uh i was uh i've always been interested in films ever since i was a child, and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination , uh i've in the last, probably, almost ten years i've traveled more than i had in the past <pa> well i've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around, so yes, seeing new places and seeing uh people that are different than i am seeing how they live , and taking in the sights , uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever went on um on the safari and , just going out in a jeep and seeing <laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible , oh yeah that's one the great experiences of my life, and i also got to uh , a a place in egypt uh at the end of that trip, um called uh , sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that, egypt would but it was just amazing i went <we> i didn't go scuba diving i went uh snorkeling , what do i do to relax uh i i do i like to listen to music, i like to uh helping watching movies helps me relax 'cause it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind, i do meditate every day, um i like to take walks in nature that's always calming, especially down by the uh the ocean , uh, what i it depends <laughter> sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times, uh , i'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something i've recently learned how to do , which is very helpful , and also since i meditate it doesn't i don't get annoyed at things as easily as i did in the past, some things that makes me really mad , i guess uh think of injustice , in the world or done to people when, uh, it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along , um , and and make the world better, <laughter> uh last night i went to a movie screening , of a independent film and i didn't think it was done very well it's not so much that we had a fun argument , about uh about the movie , so that was like you know that just happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind , <laughter>, is there anything i regret yeah there's there are have been opportunities in my life, that i wished i had, uh taken them and pursued them , uh certain jobs, you know when i first got to los angeles i had an opportunity to uh , become a grip, and uh and i i probably should've pursued that , how did i decide it to do that i don't really understand the questions, take advantage of every opportunity that came my way , to always <alway> i think saying yes , uh to any opportunity is is very important and no matter , how you feel you know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you wanna do , no, no, no but i've been depressed in my life , uh for the most part i've i've been feeling good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh, i think you know sometimes if i if i allow <allo> allow a, regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but i can you know usually get out if it pretty quickly , uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh , an an opportunity um how do i explain it eh there , sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is one way i that i if i had made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different , um , not really i mean i i feel , pretty much the same, what got me to seek help for <laughter> let's come back to that , um i've well okay well it generally talking to someone has helped when i did do that , uh pretty easy i don't have a problem sleeping , uh , usually i'm grumpy <laughter> so if i don't sleep well uh you know i feel tired and irritable , uh , how would my best friend describe me, that's a good question um friendly <f> well i'm friendly <f> i'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little bit secretive, um i would probably that i should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished and uh and uh attaining my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier , i think um , it it it's tough it depends, sometimes i'm very introverted 'cause i do like to write so that takes it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i come out of that uh i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself with, as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation and my mood , my best qualities um, i think i'm caring i think i'm intelligent , uh i think i'm funny i'm outgoing, um, i have a likeable personality , you know people have said that , um i'm engaging but not uh oppressive or overly engaging there's a sort of a cool detachment , um, and creative intuitive , <laughter> yes <laughter> , last time i felt really happy , i don't know i woke up this morning i was pretty happy , i had breakfast i was happy , sun was shining , <laughter> , um , i think that like i said going to kenya , was a memorable experience i do remember <remem> scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience i just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean , you know, and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back , um, almost beyond you know because <beca> almost beyond like , human in a way just more in touch with like everything the universe, yeah it would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but , what am i most proud of in my life , i think i've uh, helped, <pft> people , uh and, sometimes when they were in crisis, um you know i've written some screenplays <scr> screenplays, um , i've had some good relationships , um good relationships just you know being connected with someone else you know , spending time with them, and connecting , on emotional and , <laughter> physical and , mental levels , um what it could be a song that i hear on the radio, uh it could be uh, lot of times looking forward to something you know if i'm gonna go to a movie go bowling, hang out with people, um, you know looking at work, and and going to work and feeling productive can put me in it puts me in a good mood, you're welcome, bye bye",5

353,"yes, i'm fine., to pennsylvania, mhm, well, i was in boston a few years ago and then i moved here about three and a half years ago, but around i was just not satisfied with the quality of my life, to maybe once or twice last year i only returned once, one year, um, in any case safer and to definitely a, well, i just miss it because i have a lot of family back there, but l a is okay i mean everyone loves the climate here, um , not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a friend with whom i've been together for three years so that helps him to be from here, but to make it definitely took a bit of adjustment, no, to promote communication, no, i'm actually working right now, i'm not working right now., i want to be an osteopathic doctor, so basically against western medicine an osteopathic doctor is someone who, helps someone with the symptoms and not only treats the symptoms, but treats them as an entire person, so they look at diet, diet exercise, just a variety of things to really get someone to live <t>, a healthier life versus drugs or things that are commonly prescribed in western medicine today, well, one of the big things was when i got out of here to be exposed to the degree i'd never heard of living on the east coast., sometimes, well, i'm very special about the people i like to surround myself with around and, i don't like being with many people, i mean, i like small intimate groups, and i don't like being in larger or larger groups., um, when people do not take into account other people's feelings, usually, try to take a walk when i am very irritated, i'm usually really good, it really takes a lot of time for me to flood and scream or get upset., let's see., uh mm, i was with my lawyer and it was about his treatment of my case., yeah, it was him, uh, they're i don't know, i think they're just a little mediocre, they're not the best lawyers., i have no idea <laughter>, i'm very trustworthy, i'm loyal., i am very interested so i like to try to help other people, um, and i'm always trying to cheer people up, so i think that's a few of them., no, yes, a few months ago about in the last six months, to me was, experience, mental problems that i never really came from paranoia and fear and i knew it wasn't, um, i knew it wasn't me that i couldn't get over it alone., much better i did a lot of yoga and meditation to somehow see things from a different perspective, or other <ano> not per <pe> per view, but a different view and around, this has helped, but there are definitely times when i return to thinking about the event especially because the event caused that i no longer work, um , i think i know i'm having trouble being in public. i'm still dealing with fear and paranoia., to such a lot of times during the day is when it happened, so i'm not so comfortable to go during the day i tend to go into the mornings and evenings, i don't like going to places where there's only one way in and one way out., um, well, i've been trying gradually to raise how much i'm out there to, and i usually just deep breathing around i do a lot of breathing exercises and, i'm just trying to say that basically what i think or what's wrong with me is not real and that, i'm just trying <laughter> i'm just trying to go into these places more gradually much better since uh the last few months, but before i stayed a lot pretty much at home, um , it was good to hear someone's feedback, but.., i have the feeling that i have got more help in my inner conversation, with just one kind of sitting with me and journaling, i know., to <sigh>, well, i feel more like myself, which is a tremendous improvement around, and i'm more, carefully and guarded in any way over my thoughts, um, and also about my decisions, i'm not like this, i'm not so oh you know i'm just gonna do this and i'm not really thinking about the consequences of other things i want in my life, it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now around the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke up maybe two or three times and would be awake for a few hours, but now i'm sleeping through the night again, i feel like groggy <sigh>, i feel foggy and out of her, and little depressed, mm, it's.., i think it's been a while., um, work <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic around, spending time with my family, um, yes, just being outside, enjoying nature, read, around very close, what's that?, um, , um, well, my parents, because they were always very supportive and loving., gives me feedback about my decisions or what i decide to do, but allows me to make my own decisions in life and then, my sisters were just getting very close to you know just always check with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they're always around, looking for me and only with me and then my friend with this incident that happened, he was very, uh usually supportive with just let me talk and work my kind of things and understanding when i feel and don't want to go out in public and, and to be aware that it is not so easy for me to do something like a grocery store, or, to do errands without a lot of fear, i'm very proud of, the work i've done to the people i've helped., maybe that i took this job where i was attacked at <laughter>, that's it., go to retail in insecure environment, don't listen to my stomach, um , what advice would i give, what, uh, to, ruthlessly pursue your dreams, that it is not something like too late or runs out of time and, and to enjoy every moment of your life takes nothing but self evident, um , let's see., uh.., cook well i really enjoy i enjoy cooking around, so i made a few roasted vegetables just every time i cook i just really enjoy it around we have a garden so, we had greens that came and around some chilies, and cauliflower so easy with preparation that, for <f>um, for my friend and i, mhm, bye, thank you.",11
466,"<synch>, <sigh>, yes, uh okay, <laughter>, los angeles, the weather, um, the variety of um environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety, <laughter>, um i don't like the superficiality of people, um the narcissistic attitude um, uh just, the um, uh it it doesn't have a small town sort of feel where, you know just the warmth the human sort of warmth interactively, so, yeah, no, um i have um a fear of flying and i have um i've developed agoraphobia, <laughter>, uh incredibly difficult, um yeah i'm i'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia um more so than the fear of flying um, it's uh it's more of a recent um development and um, it's um, eh it's progressing <pregr> progressing um to be worse uh it's very um, uh what's the word um, immobilizing and and very um distressing actually, mhm <laughter> yes it is, how to i cope with that um, just uh, just trying to um uh, do the best i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in um small steps, um i read a lot i do um bibliotherapy reading um, and i try to inform myself um of the um, of the professional literature um so that i could um hopefully overcome it someday, mhm, um yes definitely, um, uh certain things trigger it like um enclosed spaces, um, being in a car traveling um, uh being away from home um being in someone else's car, uh things that are outside of my uh locus of control, um, uh actually i i don't go to school right now, um my dream job is, to be a psychologist <laughter>, um i'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is um, uh, having lived um through some challenges like this um having lived through some traumas, um but i've always had an interest in it um since junior high of, um, uh, i'm very interested in people and um in human interaction and human connection and, um the betterment of of uh of those things um, bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges um, uh, so that's that's sort of um it in a nutshell, um, i think i'm someone who's, um i can be very outgoing um and sort of um a warm and friendly presence very um easily but i think on <o> on on the exterior um, but i think i'm shy and i challenge it to do that, i think at heart i'm shy, um but uh but i i challenge myself completely 'cause i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges, uh the last time i interacted with somebody was <laughter> today, if <i> if i think i'm understanding your question correctly, oh no no eh i think i'm misunderstanding your question but i i interacted with rachel um i just i'm um continuously interacting with people, take taking those risks, uh very good um, mm, very good <laughter>, um, when was the last time i argued with somebody, i actually can't remember it wasn't recent <laughter>, i have to think about that i don't know yet let me think um, uh i'm drawing a blank um i can only rememeber things um, from when i was like twenty one <laughter> right now, i can't think of anything contemporary right right now, my mind is, okay uh when i was younger, yes um i lost um, a relationship with my aunt, and my uncle and my cousins, um 'cause when i was twenty one i'm forty five, um, i um, uh, uh, had a a disagreement with my aunt and um i said something that was uh critical, of her and, um she threw me out of their home, and um, uh, let me back uh i apologized immediately, and they let me back into their lives, um and changed their minds um so, i regret that, um, i'm assuming you mean um how did i feel when they asked me to um never uh be in their lives again, and to leave um, uh shattered soul shattered heart shattered, well that that was my family that was um, the the good side of my family there's um uh, uh the majority of my family <fa> they were they were the the loving aspect of my family um the rest of my family is very cruel and um like very abusive, um i don't have any relationship with my family at all, like the, since i was um, uh twenty one since my aunt and uncle um, uh, disowned me i guess is the right word, estranged yeah, um, gosh um i'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second, um something i could um erase um, <laughter> i can't even get it to my memory, um, uh as an example um, uh, i was injured and i wish i could get uh that away from my memory, yeah um, i was injured in um the emergency room, , doing um i went in for food poisoning um i was ordered to go in um, by a doctor um i had collapsed and, i was ordered to go into the e_r for as i said food poisoning and i came out um injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a um, uh what do you call it um, uh intraveneous procedure um and now i have um, r_s_d reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and it the scene in the emergency room was um it was a an out of control scene there was a problem with the procedure, and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake, um, eh and it was extremely excruciating um it was a a crisis, and so um every time i think about, the injury and it was uh disfiguring i got disabled, um, for <f> i uh got disabled for it uh disabled permanently um from it i was also um, uh disabled from my employment for a quite amount of quite a given amount of time as well, and, and it i have residual um, physical trauma from it and disfigurement and um, severe disability <disabil> disability limited um, um, functionality uh with my right my, i'm right-handed uh with my right hand, and arm, thank you, i don't even know what that is, um, i, you know i i really, i apologize 'cause i can't really probably give you the, uh most suitable answer um, uh, i'm guessing it had something to do with um , my cat um and her um, her urgent uh, um, uh what do you call it, um hurt she was in intensive care veterinary care and i'm sure it had something to do with that, um, but other than that i would say um i had uh choosing my life path whether, , um and uh i was admitted um to that program, or whether i was gonna go um to um art school for four years um, and i had to pick a life direction but uh that's not a traumatic situation um, so i i don't know how best to answer your question, i can't, um i have um, severe nightmares <laughter> and i have um nocturnal um , uh panic attacks, and i also have physical illness on top of it and i'm in excruciating pain, yes, yes, yes uh they're triggered by the injury that i told you, um they're triggered by my family, um, they've <th> how they've treated me what um they've said to me what they've done to me um, they're triggered by um, what else um my um my physical um illness um not my injury only but my physical, um illness as well um, so yes, um, i feel very ill, and, feel so fatigued, very ill and very fatigued, um, when i don't sleep and get enough sleep um uh my anxiety level i believe is up and, um i'm susceptible to feeling distressed, um, so yeah, yes, um three years ago um my <m> my most recent um diagnosis, and in two thousand and one as well, uh yes, um, three years ago and um, when i was um, twenty years old, um the my background my childhood um, from my family of origin um, and their um uh, uh you know the abuse that i um went through, uh and their ultimate um uh, uh what's the word um, rejection of me and uh estrangement um that was the first uh reason, um, no i stopped six months ago, <sigh> um, why did i stop um i'm just taking a break <laughter> i'm gonna continue, yes very much, it's helped tremendously, um, i think it helps with anxiety it helps with um, um, it helps inspire um create inspiration it helps um, um, uh feeling connected, um it helps to create um what i ultimately um my goal is to, um give myself a voice and um, um, uh it helps to to do <d> to uh, it <i> it's part of that process, um it also helps um to understand myself um to learn about myself, um, and eh there's just so many benefits it's, i, i'll stop right there there's many more, mhm, um, the last time i felt really happy, it was a was a really long time ago um it was before my illness, um and it was in nineteen ninety seven um the onset of my illness was in july of ninety seven so it was um before that <laughter>, yes um, i was um in a very good place um in terms of my career um, um in terms of um, uh my just my relationships and um everything was just sort of at it's best um, uh career relationships um, personal um uh fulfillment um sort of um, as well um i was very active and and doing, uh very many things that were meaningful to um build a life um and i was um in the process of um, uh just in the in <i> in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished, at at the same time so it was just things were just going very well and um i just really liked uh, the just where my life was at it was just in a really good place in many ways, mhm, um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety, um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia, my p_t_s_d um meaning my trauma um and um, uh, what else um, um, my insecurity uh as far as um, uh, just um, with <w> with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that um, that i don't do something that that um, hold on one second, i'm just trying to make sure that um i don't do anything that's um offensive to them or insults them, um, or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like i'm overly um cautious about that and um, it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself, um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial, uh to change um the other thing i'd like to change about myself is i wish i could feel, um and also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um, i wish i didn't feel um, uh so um, uh i didn't wish i didn't have the burden that i do of um, my family um of not having one, um, and uh what else um i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical, um excruciating pain that i'm in uh so those are some things um, and i also wish that um, and this is um a a by-product of p_t_s_d i wish that i didn't have um, uh, the the symptomology, of p_t_s_d um 'cause that definitely um, affects one's complete <com> complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely, um and i i wish i was more articulate, and i wish i was um someone who was well-spoken, and someone who is well-written, um but there's many there's many more um, uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself, so many more, <sigh> um, i'm not sure uh, <sniffle>, maybe to um not be so trusting um, i trusted um, i trusted some medical professionals that um, you know again created the injury, and um, you know were, there's a uh, what's the word, there's an expectation and a sort of a demand to just, blindly trust um the medical profession um and, <sniffle> um, don't ask questions and just sort of um, you know, and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition, um and so i would, i would've told myself to be a little more careful um, i guess if that's, useful to your question, <sniffle>, um what did i really enjoy um, you know i can't think of anything specific um, but um, i know it would have to do um, with either reading or um, connecting with someone on a meaningful level, <sniffle>, i'm most proud of um, my compassion, um, my um my uh empathy and caring about people, um, despite um i mean i'm proud of it, anyways but um also particularly <sniffle> um i come from a, um an environment that's the opposite um a background and um i wasn't taught that <sniffle> um but i really do care about people and um, i'm i guess i'm most proud of that i'm also proud of my um career, accomplishments, um and my um tenacity um my fierce <fie> my fierce tenacity to succeed, um <sniffle> and uh, you know just um also to get um the strength it takes to get through um, the injury, uh to live with it and to live with the illness um that i live with the physical illness, um, so i i think that would be it, <sniffle>, yes, okay, you're welcome, bye",9

363,"<synch>, yes, good how are you, i am from los angeles, yes, um, it's uh center of everything eh you can get to all the places you need to go to uh eh without having to drive very far, um i like being in the city, well, being in l_a also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion, and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great, but, you know you live with that, um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um, after i finished college i um, uh pursued a career in retail operations, uh no i as a matter of fact i am not i kinda changed career, uh over the last four or five years so i'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business, um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business, i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge <knowl> a lot of knowledge um, in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company, yes i'm very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh, and it's very helpful, <laughter>, well my dream job is um, i'm basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh, independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs, and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do, and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so, i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be, mm, i'm not, well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm, probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean, when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um, obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself, oh sure you know i have um, uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to, yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me, um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um, if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it, actually um, my relaxation is um i'm currently um, living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know, um i'm not um, i'm not a, short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned, there's not there's not much to that, um, i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um, being very difficult to work with um, and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh, they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because, um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that, it does <laughter>, probably the hardest decision i ever had to make was um, it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and, yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would it would kill him you know, um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i, i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run, it is, it was, um, well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated, and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together, and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so, she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old, and, and so she needs to, uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh, someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child, probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage, um as far as um, the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife, uh yeah i um, got caught up in a situation where, um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart, and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so, you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money, and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship, had to do with trust because um, it it was devastating to my wife, i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light, um i felt very guilty, and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life, no not at all, no not really no, i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no, no, not at all, no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um, after i had my heart attack a few years ago, um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before, so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that, the last time i felt really happy, um, probably when, i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack, and um, he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that, he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue, no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack, and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications, well i guess number one thing is uh, my physical being itself, i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight, um, just in general just be more healthier physically, and as far as mentally um just not, go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish, just one day at a time, you know i just uh, try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis, i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself, i do things to help myself, well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage, uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and, and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but, um, at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done, so i don't focus too much on the past, i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day, what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing, to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed, um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh, i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um, , you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately, probably, the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that, um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that, um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive, uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy, and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh, just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night, one day at a time, it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where, you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines, and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore, um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably, easygoing generous, um a nice person to be around, and um, you know, they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues, uh related to the gambling and the, my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know, well my ideal weekend starts off usually um, after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock, um i go to a local park and uh it's about, this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning, um, get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um, you know go home, um work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax and then, just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch t_v whatever just relax, that's how a weekend goes for me, and thank you, bye",0
417,"yes, i'm okay, uh los angeles <laughter>, um i don't know <laughter>, um, it's kinda dirty but that's to be expected from a big city, um my the last class that i took was a sociology class um i'm not <n> i'm not really sure where i'm going with school but i'm thinking about sex education, i think that it's a really important job um, uh i feel like, uh because there's kind of uh, stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies, so i feel like it's a very important job for, the world <laughter>, i don't know <laughter>, no, um lack of funds, um it depends on the people but i'd say that uh generally i'm more shy, uh of course with people who i know well, like they're closer to me i i'm more outgoing, um play with my dogs, uh, i don't know uh if it's a nice day i'll go for a walk, um, if it's not a nice day then or if it's cold out or something then, uh maybe watch a show on t_v i like or read a book or something, i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper, um i can't remember i think the last person i argued with, was my boyfriend, probably last week but i don't even remember what it was about <laughter>, um, i don't think i really feel guilty about anything i'd say that i regret things but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret um, like i think guilt is more just like feeling bad, but regret is like, um feeling like you should've made a different decision and, i think that can help you in, to make better decisions in the future whereas guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <laughter>, um, i regret not doing better uh when i was in high school, um, uh, i mean not getting better grades, um, i regret uh, like getting involved with certain people in the past, but i mean i don't i'm not sure <laughter>, that's about it that i can think of right now <laughter>, hm, um, uh yeah i mean i mean in the past, uh yeah i could've made, different decisions, i mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but i'm not going to feel i'm not going to regret things that i had no power over so, um, i'm not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory, but, i wish that it didn't happen to me uh was uh the time that i was raped, <laughter> i can't really think of any hard decisions um, hm, i can't think of any <laughter>, hm, i'm not sure <laughter> i can't think of any, uh i have a pretty good relationship with my family um, uh not, i wouldn't say that i'm really close with my mother but i mean we get along well, and i'm very close with my sister we're basically best friends, um, hm, i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life, uh, because she was always able to provide for me and she always, she didn't i mean she made, like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it, and um she just did her best to raise me so, i think she was a big positive influence, uh it's been easy lately, uh sometimes i have trouble sleeping but uh, lately i have had no problems, um, it depends how long i've gone without sleep i can just, be anywhere from like, groggy to like um, really on edge, and like um, extremely tired <laughter> i don't know, um i have been feeling, pretty good i uh, i have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been, in the past, so, been feeling mostly pretty good, um i think that i've actually been feeling, happier lately, i wouldn't say that i'm like really happy all the time i mostly just kind of, like, um, neutral but i have been feeling, more positive lately, i'm actually not sure if i've been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, um, uh, i know that i i've been seeing uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like, since i was sixteen, um for depression, and uh i think my first psychologist who i saw for a few years, thought that i had p_t_s_d but i'm not sure if she, ever made a diagnosis, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, uh, i'm <laughter> i don't know, yes, um, it's helpful to uh, talk someone and have them kind of, um, guide you in, talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your, feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something, i mean, i think sometimes you can do that on your own but, uh, talking to somebody helps i think, um, hm, i'm not sure <laughter>, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, uh, i think i would spend it mostly, at home, um but it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit, and i'd play with my dogs and, uh, i'd probably have my boyfriend over, um, i'd eat food that i like, like only food that i like like my favorite foods um, watch, movie or t_v show that i like, um, just, kind of have like a relaxing time but, that's nice, mm, i would tell myself to uh, to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever, and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like, sort of lose interest and then, uh not do well, or as well as i could have, so i would tell myself to, do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more, than i do, and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship <schol> a scholarship if i had done well in high school, so i would just tell myself to do good in school, probably warn myself about one or two people that, turned out to be not worth my time <laughter>, um, hm, um, i think i am, proud of myself for not, being um, bitter and for wanting, to, uh, well i am kind of bitter i guess but i guess i'm proud of myself, for not being selfish and wanting to, um make the world a better place like 'cause a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to instead instead of dwell on them, i try to, um, or i want, to be able to make things better for other people, and as much as i wanna help i guess um empower people to make their lives better, bye",7
407,"yes, i feel really good because i.., i've been sleeping, all day yesterday almost and i usually do something when it's not work, it's school when it's not school, it's work and then social life and all that, so i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have a school, i only have school on the weekdays, so i actually slept probably like, eighty five percent of the day, so i really feel good, but i'm actually kind of tired and i've got other things going on, but different from that i'm good today, i'm originally from bakersfield., california, really, i moved to l a when i was a child and then, i left here when i was about three or four., and i was moved, i moved back here, in oh seven and i have lived here, since, um, wow since i've been here since oh seven i'm just back maybe <clears thoat>, maybe how, a few times <ti> well i went there for like a summer, as in oh, eight, i think i've been there almost all summer, but i've only been back a few times since i got back., unfortunately,, uh, um, uh, um, uh it's similar to l a, it's not really comparable to l a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i, anyway, i don't know if i forgot anyway, yes, there's nothing really to do, it's really small, it's the valley around, i have everything to do., oceans and it is located by all kinds of around, through many cool places like vegas and uh, san diego and what have you not so <s>, but yes, otherwise i miss my friends and stuff, but i don't miss, like the actual city, i just miss some of the people who, i grew up with, oh, i can't see your shoes, but i don't travel much, actually i was just out, california like six times, i'd love to travel, once i uh, have enough money to do this, um, i originally wanted to be a filmmaker, and that i still want to be a filmmaker and i want to, studying <stu> i was, i took the communication and uh, have also general ed things and around, took classes like video production and around <tisk>, has done a lot uh in terms of to films, and i've learned a lot of things and i still have that knowledge, but i haven't really used it since i've been back, here in l a i did all this in northern california in sacramento, but around and then i switched <trans> to be, um to the business i took some courses in that, but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done, with schooling and always ready to try to get into the field and, become an optician so, but i still want to be a filmmaker, and that's still one of my plans., and i still have to actually play in to poker, a few years ago and i really like, the idea of becoming, a full time filmmaker or full time poker player, but both of these jobs are, extremely hard to earn out and you, must be like the small percent so that we can see if then, hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere, to be an optician, oh, uh,, i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it was like a trade, it's good, it's a private college, but, it just as specific, trains you in.., a field and you just learn that you don't like your g e and, all these other classes as you would normally do for how to, like one around a major or whatever you're going to do, so it trains you specifically to be an optician and jump into the field, i took it just because i really want to be a dentist assistant and since <si>, it sounds like something i might be able to do., it sounds interesting, but then the consultant actually, to get my attention on an optician, so, i'm trying to be an optician now, and it's so interesting, it's fun, it's.., really hard, but it's interesting and it, and it's, and it's fun it's got to be rewarding, um, benefits to the extent that it is worthwhile to be able to help people to see, better and feel comfortable with, glasses or contact lenses, whatever they feel, more comfortable with, cool, i'm definitely leaving, but i can be shy, sometimes like i'm a little shy right now because, they're talking to you and you're in a computer and you're a cartoon, or uh animated or whatever <laughter>, so, cool, but none normally ninety eight percent, to me actually, what it's actually kind of funny and i think maybe, this could go for some of the poker players to, i've never really spoken to a professional poker player, but as far as i want, uh, actually.., playing poker is about, actually something that, helps me forget everything, as far as e.g., things in the past or present, um or future things that come uh as far as i'm really relaxed <rela>, i just couldn't think about anything and just think about poker and it's actually kind of like a therapy, for me, because i don't like it, i guess you could say it's some kind of drug because i don't think about anything as far as stressed or depressed or things that have happened in the past, i focus on poker, so it's actually kind of exhilarating, playing poker is also very stressful, so i guess it's kind of like, catch twenty two or whatever, but uh, yeah so no poker i play like basketball, i like watching movies i like going to the beach actually, one of the things i like to do is go to the beach because it does, i feel good., but i didn't leave., i usually just go to the beach when it's hot not during the, cold season, so it's coming soon, so i'm looking forward to being busy, but uh, i'll try to go to the beach as much as i can <laughter>, i'm really good at controlling my temperament, actually i've just been in like, i'm thirty years old, i've been in six fights, maybe and, all six were launched by the other person., so i've never started a real fight in my whole life when i was a little kid, but, to talk about real things, like when you put it on a, thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every once in a while when there was, a few times maybe in the past, where like i, was not able to control it, but as far as ever to be violent or anything that never happened and never would, but for.., most of the time yeah i didn't like, people do stupid things all the time and i just like to leave it especially like, on the highway and stuff, but uh, oh well i mean i argued a little bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really, little things, i guess maybe we're just, i think we were good for each other, but maybe another life because uh, we just knocked our heads too much., obviously, she's probably my ex girlfriend for a reason like this., about which we have only quarreled, girlfriend friend things, uh, um, i guess my film production <filmm> to, other treatment, there are a lot of things i could have handled differently, but uh, uh maybe when i was really good when i was younger and, i worked for, , production assistant for filmmakers around, where i lived in sacramento, so i did everything i wanted to do about my dreams, and had a lot of my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment, and then i got involved with the wrong guy., group of people i appreciate and, somehow downhill from there and how lost everything like car job apartment, so i just wish maybe i'd never go with, this kind of people, this kind of girls, um, um.., per and per, uh, because i'd clean my throat, probably my life would probably be a lot different now but i think everything happens for a reason, and obviously i think you should also like when things happen good or bad uh, <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again, you.., do not make this mistake or try it not so bad i think so, you know, mm, hardest decision, i guess, i guess, uh, toughest decision, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, would be.., i guess you could say i don't really know., wanted to say that uh, maybe like my ex girlfriend, like i could've liked, stayed with her and i really like still in love with her and uh, would love to be with her and miss her, but i guess the biggest mistake i had to make was how, i know it wasn't like a healthy relationship and, i know if we liked to stay together or if we married or had children who, i don't think it would work in the end anyway, i guess the decision that would be my hardest decision, to really stay away from her and not come back with her, and uh, don't be like that with her, i guess that was a tough really hard decision because.., i could have done it easy, and i guess maybe it would have been me., in this way happier, but stressed and, in order to be irritable or whatever and have to deal with the other way with it i guess with each other our relationship so, it was really hard is still so uh i think that's it, do not choose to be with someone i loved and loved, or whatever it is, cool, oh, what was that?, i beg your pardon., nevad, i do not understand the first part of this question., oh an event, oh an event okay around that i could delete, uh event i could get out of my memory, my ex girlfriend, i wish i'd never met her., my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend, i wish i'd never met her because we were, we were in love together for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard, so, i guess both of them, oh, it's extremely easy that i could fall asleep, somewhere i actually broke a record i almost fell asleep standing, that would have been strange because i think i would have, i don't know that i just got caught., i think i was really <r> i mean i was really tired, but i do a lot of things so it's hard for me not really get so much sleep, as much as i want to like <l>, but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever., as they say, <tisk> uh no, no, lately i'm just tired, but i'm fine i guess, i'm dealing with this separation, but it's only a month a week., but it's actually not i mean i've happened worse things i'm going to happen worse things, had worse things happen so yeah, i guess.., well, i'm a religious person, i'm catholic i believe in god i know that there is a god so around i obviously even dedicated everything from him, people to god, no matter what they are, sometimes they lose faith, so sometimes i lose faith, but it doesn't take that long and i know there's a god i know., that i'm gonna be okay and that everything's gonna be okay, but you know, it's hard to deal with, i don't really know, i just keep going you know, go to school and work, and i just have to keep going, i can't give up, so i can just, try to stay busy and, staying busy helps somehow and how to sleep, a lot helps, but i can't sleep much so, i don't know., uh play poker, play basketball, deals helps me deal with it and how uh, hanging out with my friends sometimes helps me, why, um, uh, um, uh.., i felt really happy on friday because.., i went to san diego for the first time., it wasn't as cool as i thought, but we were like under certain circumstances, as far as my boyfriend had business to worry about and it took a long time so, i would have preferred to be free during this time but i wasn't, but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i had fun and i was, happy to go to san diego for the first time and i want to, had a good time, oh, she's, to <laughter>, a lot of things, but i think i'd say how, be nicer to like, family members you know a couple of family members i wish i had been, other than , acted differently than not that i was like a terrible, but i would have nicer in some cases that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh, i never really wanted to go around and celebrate all the time as i did, like high school and various part times from outside high school i would have only, really focused on re training and so and then, the party would not have gotten any relationships later, so i would have basically told myself to be more., uh have more direction to be focused, i guess uh, stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i don't appreciate that i'm the healthiest but < sniffle> around yeah i just would have done a lot of things differently, but, i don't know if i said that before, but i think it's all happening for a reason., um, so i guess it all happened., now for a reason, so i'm just gonna keep going., uh, <tisk> i guess they would have the few i have, or few i had because i have best friends now a few i think a new, and i've lost a few best friends as far as we just don't like going our own ways, but i guess they'd probably all describe me more than how, to happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy, umm aloud uh, don't be silly., uh intelligent, and uh, i just think in uh in general just like, entertaining to be around, have, i wasn't always the best friend, but i'm trying to tell you my toughest, so that's how it's like, cool, to <sigh>, change me uh, i wish i'd been around, < > i wish i was 15 pounds lighter, um, i wish i didn't have to., uh, how can i say put this uh i feel like, um, i feel like i'm i feel like i'm, i must be like in a relationship with a girl, i feel like i wish i didn't have to be, as if i felt like, that i had to have a girl all the time, and so i could help me focus on how more, and i wish i didn't need it, sexually around, i didn't always think about sex thing to girls all the time as far as, i have to be in a sex, with them like, as far as sex wants to do as much as i do because i feel like, if i have not concentrated or have to, how to be with girls or like in a relationship, well, who i don't know how to say it, but i'm just saying how i exist like guy friends i know, i don't need as much sex as i do and i feel like i need more than i sometimes feel like i wish i didn't need it that much, so i think i'm a little addicted to it., where i could focus on more things than just, i mean, i don't just focus on sex, but i feel like i'm focusing on it if i don't need it or think i need it so much that i could do more things in my life., but, yeah, so i'm trying to work on it., <low breath> <sigh> what i am most proud of, uh, i'm very proud of, <makes sounds with the mouth>, i'm very proud <prou> oh i guess i'm very proud to work for tv stations back in sacramento and on a lot of around, movie sets, because like me, i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then, two years later, a year and a half later, i started taking steps to become a filmmaker and then i worked., work in the economy and as a filmmaker for a real, really.., really.., good to cinematograph a really good to freelance cinematograph, which is based on living in sacramento they have a lot of things, so i'm proud to have had a dream and i went for them and i and actually end up doing things to my dream, which in my dream so, yeah, i guess that's one of my greatest accomplishments, like, over ten years ago but i hope i know, something like that could happen again soon or you know it like this, perfect, goodbye.",3

depressed longer than that but officially october of last year , um , actually i was uh being treated for other medical issues and, um, my depression was notable to the doctors so, yeah , yeah , um , well i've never been suicidal but just to just to just in i i just often have thought um , eh, that i don't have much reason to to live i used to think i had a purpose and such but, um i don't really have anybody in my life um , who i think cares enough about me uh , that i really <rea> if i was even dead uh so, um i've kind of lost myself , and um i used to that used to be enough , that i was um

well i used to be proud of my career and um , kinda giving back to people giving back to society um 'cause i was given , a lot it felt like um <sigh>, so i'm just proud to uh , i don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest i i've um, it uh i don't know <sigh>, <laughter> psychology, and um , well initially yeah , um no not really per se although my current career involves a lot of uh , psychology a lot of um , uh the aspects i don't know what i'm trying to say um , it's a part <p> it's a part of it but it's not the center of it , um well i guess if my career is still going i'm in uh nursing but um, i've been sick lately and with depression and other healthcare problems i , uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income , and i'm starting

410,"yes, uh i'm fine today today is my daughter's birthday, california, yes, um the beach, i love the waters, the gang violence, violence, um i lost a lot of friends growing up in, um through elementary and high school, just losing them through gang violence, yeah thank you, it was pretty tough out there <laughter>, um, haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really, um i'm an optician i'm a certified optician, and i also have my associate's degree, um actually i went in, i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied, i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful, um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything, um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i, i always thought like they were so cool 'cause their white long lab coats, to be a optometrist, um 'cause i'm already an optician and that's like the first step, and um what i why is a good question it's because, then i would have a be able to have my own business, and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter, and she wouldn't have to really want to anything it would be like a, a family business but a a to help the community as well, and something i could leave for my daughter, uh my daughter she's five years old, uh she'll be starting elementary school next week, and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her <laughter> um she is, very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um, she's adorable she's my heart, no, this is like the hardest job ever <laughter>, it's very hard, providing, providing uh making sure that, you wash their clothes um 'cause 'cause i mean it's hard enough, to be um a parent but i'm a young parent and, i'm a little more mature than her father so, it's um, it's it's the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so, complicated let alone um, it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um, even being here today i probably would've still been in bed but today is my daughter's party, and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to, make sure that she has a good day so, it's all about uh going the extra mile, doing anything that you can do to provide <pro> to provide for them but it it's a very hard job, um, that moment of the day, when your child tells you how much they care about you, and um, my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and, how many, i mean just call your name it just, it's a sense of reality um, to be called mom or to call call dad and, it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what i'm living right now and, it's a it's a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent, thank you, um, a lot of different things i'm actually, taking care of my daughter <laughter> um, i'm here with her uh, i was raised by my grandparents so, i mean i didn't really i didn't get to know my mom til i was sixteen and, my father i mean i couldn't point him out, on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is so, i feel that um, i'm very different from them because, no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up, yeah, um, i guess i, there's been <yawning> oh excuse me um there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive, in my life i can say, um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field, she's in the uh she's an l_v_a, and um she's one of my older sisters, um i can say, me believing in god, being in my life god being in my life has, also kept my strong and to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and, um, hm, i don't know, i don't really look up to a lot of different people because, people lie so, and that's the most what i could think that's been positive for me, i think i'm outgoing <laughter> i used to be shy, um coming up as a kid and, i don't know i don't know what happened to me, uh one day i just broke out of my shell and, i've been um, very accurate of, showing my personality off <laughter>, um, i actually like, for, the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach, and i like to just sit there, and just zone out everybody else that's there, and rub my toes in the sand, and that is so relaxing, um <yawning>, excuse me sorry about that um, i learned not to uh 'cause it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or someone else's, and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper, is showing that i'm in charge of my life, so i don't even let stuff get to me, i don't even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because that's how much i try to block out the, the negativity, mm probably my husband <yawning>, my daughter's father um, uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh, physical altercation like with another human being no, wow, um being honest, i kind of feel guilty, about how things like uh basically how things ended, um before my mom passed i wish that, i could've, helped her a little more, even though people tell me not to feel bad, um because she wasn't really there for me growing up, but i kind of feel guilty like you know, not being there as much as i could've been for her, before she passed away so, i think that's something that i um i still feel guilty for, um, going through my mom passing away, um, i felt like <clearing throat> i felt like um, basically that, it was i felt kind of, robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and, i grew up with my grandparents and then, for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad, for me to get eighteen years old and then then she leaves me, it was kind of like um, i don't know it was nerve wracking because, i felt, robbed you know it was like, i didn't have her all these years and then now that i'm older and i'm i don't even have her now, so, um, signing the paper of having a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter, i was so nervous so scared, um really didn't know what to do how to take it, and i mean like that was so scary, um it was the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world, yes, it's hard <laughter> i didn't even sleep last night, that's why i'm yawning <yarning> but um, uh i i kind of tend to, try to do everything and i have to get, back to that stage where, i have to think about myself as well, and give myself time, um a little like this, but actually i'm a little nicer today <laughter>, um, just groggy, um <yawning>, lately i've been feeling very confident, about um being positive about, going the extra mile of being a good parent, uh, <yawning> yeah i actually really don't care what other people think anymore, i used to let that bother me but i don't no more, no, no, um, uh today 'cause, i was so happy that i brought <brung>, my daughter into this world today on her birthday, um getting to know people, mhm mm not at the moment, if i go, uh to watch who i associate with, my weight <laughter>, uh, i would say my grandma, mm, um uh, uh it's it's just, uh i'd rather not, um my daughter, that's my pride and joy, wow thank you, bye",12
386,"yes, oh well a little tired, but uh i found out that my thyroid is i think so <laughter>, i was born in canada, and but i have lived most of my life in california so, and it's gray today, too, so the gray weather makes you kind of sluggish, the < slaughter>, oh, my god, years and years ago, i don't think i've been back a long time., well, air fares have risen quite sharply in recent years, so gas prices have risen., traveling as much as it is a fun thing to do, it's expensive, so, uh huh, oh let's see, everything has plus and minus for cold weather <laughter> not so much sun, so i think i'd rather have more sun and the warm weather so but different from the, it is very pretty back there natural landscape and, but i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy, but that's a little thing, with, so, mhm, why did i move to l a because my family came here and started, uh my dad has a job here and, that became our home base and uh, that's why, easy very easy so, uh huh, uh good at high school you're generally studying ed yeah it's they've set courses and then after that, went to college and i was a business major, let's see, i was a veterinary major <laughter>, and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so, um, i don't know., can't really determine why <laughter>, so, i worked in social services, but i also worked in sales and most recently i do real estate, i'm a leasing consultant part time, i mean, everything has plus and minus it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives, oh, likely to work as a uh gossip columnist at, t m z or any of these networks < laughter>, but as you know, everything in the entertainment business is very competitive, it's who you know so much, but that would be my dream job or probably work with uh cats you know animals, so, i'm very starting in fact, i think i'm going out so, i scare people sometimes there's a lot of rest, you know the reserved people out there, so i'm some kind of east coast very you know i go to people and talk to them very socially, oh, my god, there i could do hundreds of things i could read, i could watch a show that turns on the music is great to, go for a walk, uh, call my friends., millions of things <laughter> like this, i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean, you know, of course, if you drive in l a and someone, cuts in front of you sometimes this can be irritating, but i'm actually pretty i'm not the kind of person who fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so, mhm, mm, i can't remember., as i said, there are not very many arguments usually i, avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so, i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> now or that i can imagine, mm, i can't think of anything right now., i, i really can't think of any decisions that were really tough, i mean, most of them are pretty easy for me to make a decision, so i don't have a family, so if i need to know that i had to move to san francisco once to have a job, but, since i'm single, i don't really have to consider other people and children and, this kind of thing, so it somehow makes certain things easier if you don't have to look at family, mm, yeah, that's good., an event, hmm, well, obviously you don't know that a family member you know you want everyone to be there forever., so i know when my father died, you know, i mean,, i wish i had had him much longer, i mean, he died at the age of seventy seven and you know, would have been nice to have him a little bit more, but, you know you can't control these things that life has to do with., the, so, mhm, yes, there are <laughter> yin and yang who are old uh, philosophy and it really applies there is a plus a minus and negatives and positives, so, as i said, my father is no longer here and my mother and i know you have our differences i think moms and daughters always do, around my brother and i understand myself well i see him a lot i see < s> my sister works a lot, i see her, and you know we're talking, and she has her own life and her kids i know well with., so, mhm we have a small family, uh <laughter> once again it's like this is a difficult question to answer, there are so many, guys of kids out there, i think, most of them seem pretty dazed, i mean, you know, there's always gonna be kids who kind of got out of control., but.., i don't know the ones i saw recently, they're very, well dizzy, so can not say much more about it, now <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in an apartment, but.., there's someone living above me, i'm on the first floor and there's someone on the second floor and they're pretty quiet, but.., they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have a lot of energy around them will usually shower around midnight and sometimes they will start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes, run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't, yes and i need eight hours of sleep and i just got, oh, i'd say maybe six hours, and then i usually wake up at night, because sometimes they're just.., about two or three o'clock in the morning, they're either walking around or i hear something like that., i don't exactly get eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>, but there aren't, like i said, things you can't control when you're living in an apartment, you know, i mean, the lady's very quiet it's just that she's got a habit,, you know, under later showers <laughter> wash laundry at night, that is, i can't tell her about it., so, yeah, but you know there are people who are in worse situations, so i don't make much of it, you know it, and i don't like every night, but you know it., at least twice a week, so i know i may have to sleep in another room, but, for now, you know i'm gonna deal with this, like,, tired <laughter> very tired and hard to concentrate hard to concentrate it only takes longer to do things because i don't have my energy too i didn't train i usually try to go about half an hour a day, but, the weather was a little colder and a little drier so, you know, i'm not so motivated when the weather's kind of blah, so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours of sleep, mhm, uh, like i said, uh, tired <laughter> i'm, it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles at the moment we have very gray days i live very close to the sea, so the sun doesn't get out so much, so i don't get my serotonin <laughter> i need the, i um, i can't get my eight hours of sleep because you know,, whatever and i think my thyroid's too high, so that's kind of, create you know i have some vitamin deficiency, and, you know, as soon as the sun comes out, i'm kind of more energetic it just gives you more energy like this., not mm mm, no, i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person, and i like to be other people i mean, of course, i like my private time, but i like it to be people pretty much so, hmm, i mean, i usually enjoy everything i do, there's nothing that stands out more than anything else., no, i never regret anything, uh huh, what advice would i have given well, i guess i could probably change things around me thinking it, i probably would have had another college major., you know, it seems like <laughter>, uh what else around me probably not with certain men <laughter>um, waste of time with certain people, i don't know that these are the things that come to mind, maybe started saving money earlier you know these kinds of things, but, mm, spend a lot of fun with to uh just be a good friend to have people like me for a friend i'm loyally trusting and uh, i hear i'm a good listener, i'm very patient <laughter> and so, mhm, good <laughter> number one would be to lose weight, but, i think this is a worldwide problem, i mean, there's a lot of food around and temptations and, especially here in america are many of us couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we, you know it's easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you you need to talk yourself into it so, this is the weight you know will also give you more energy when you lose weight, so that's a big thing than good, but that's probably just the weight thing yeah, mhm, i think you'd have asked me that question before <laughter>., but if you want, i'll repeat it., i'm very uh, like i said, i'm very loyal when i tell people that i'm going to do something that i'm very reliable., uh, i'm warm, i'm very friendly, i'm a great listener., and i know i've got so many people telling me that they just like with me, like i said i'm very i'm pretty optimistic you know i'm, i'm not gonna let things get me down too much., hmm, this is a difficult question <laughter>, i can't believe i mean, i'm, i can't imagine answering that <laughter> so <laughter>, for fun good i love movies i could see every movie they make around, i love to go out with my friends, shopping swapmeets around my gosh and travel is great road trips, um, that's kind of, you know, part of it yes that i mentioned so, traveling always to see different places the history aspect of him, to enjoy the food food in different countries, uh the architecture, it's just kind of neat to get away and see a completely different place, mhm, okay well <laughter> i've been around, to many places in europe i love paris uh it's such a hiking town you can, whoever designed the city, i'm telling you, i mean, you can get from one point to another the subways are great to, each area has its own distinctive type of there is the latin quarter in which the students are, there is another area where the fashion designers.., like our rodeo ride here in beverly hills, there is an area that more africans <af> africans and they have swapmeets on weekends that are wonderful for international, and then, as i said, when you get out of paris, there's so much history that you can see the other way around, there are other palaces that you can go to the south of france., but this is probably my favorite country, which i was also in italy., uh, yes well after college people usually i mean people who go to college or either before or after college, this is a great time to go to europe because you're young and not tied up you don't have a family and, you have a more adventurous mind that you have more energy, so you know, carrying backpacks or suitcases isn't a big deal around, so yes, that's, mhm, yeah, that's good., mhm, thank you., goodbye.",11
471,"<synch>, yes, i'm doing well thank you, from los <l> los angeles, mm sports outdoor sports mainly, surfing uh snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing, traffic, yes, experiencing different cultures, uh well uh i love going to mexico, and uh eh it's so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but, uh the uh the level of, of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds, traveling you mean, uh, i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua, and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes, and uh it's a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible, uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place, i studied biology, uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also, not at all i'm working in, areas of business now, yes i am, my dream job would be to be a missionary, yes, my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very, generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily, but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket, i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that, i exercise, i think i'm pretty good at it uh, uh i think i'm pretty effective at it, it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend, and it was about her uh lack of consideration, um, i felt frustrated, hmm, a situation which, i wished i could handle differently um, i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh, be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior, i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that, is so wrong, and so, in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my, displeasure with someone's actions right away and that, uh takes care of the anger immediately, yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think, eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end, uh it diffuses trouble rather than, prolongs or protracts the trouble, uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued, uh at length for many, months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to, i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh, uh difficult period, in my life, mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their, uh betrayals uh but now i realize that, keeping those memories make me who i am today and, and dealing with them defines who i am today, uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that, um even though my father was somewhat of a uh, hard-handed uh, and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died, and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother, but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect, me also just, just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil, uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um, he's clinically depressed, and he has suicidal tendencies, and uh he's not working he's very highly educated, and he uh well he doesn't talk to me, and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family, yes, you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model, he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest, and kind, uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers, eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two, and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago, um, i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress, i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay, that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future, about whether, i will survive this or not, not really, no, never, never, oh i was either surfing or snowboarding, or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion, funny, jovial, uh uh intelligent a perfectionist, hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um, maybe, uh is to submerge my uh, hedonistic self, i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um, uh deferrer of gratification, he, put, now behind him and he put what will be in the future, in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was, whereas i am looking always for the present, um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to, uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away, <deep breath> it would be, my ex-boss, and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using, uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way, and he continued to use more profanity, until uh, i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred, a year and a half ago, mhm, anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids, sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that, that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had, and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because, that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness, because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not, we do not have the highest, uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree, mm, that's a good one i would say, <laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that, and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so, i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far, i, was giving a, rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing, and many of these people have never done it before, and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so, that was very gratifying to me, <deep breath>, i would say <sigh> my, devotion to, the environment, uh i wasn't always an environmentalist but uh, i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um, uh a steward, of the environment because today they're a lot of peoples people that are, polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and, i stand up and i uh have been on t_v and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment, you're welcome, goodbye",0
331,"yes , okay , connecticut, um , to be an actor <laughter> , well i moved to san francisco in ninety four and then i moved to atlanta in ninety six and then i moved out here to be an actor and i became a realtor instead , um to be on a t_v show an actor , it's pretty hard to get discovered and uh , you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented , <laughter> yeah , not really no i don't travel that much i used to move um every couple years to a different city and then i've been here for a while so i don't travel much, the weather, um there's always something to do, and um, that's pretty much it <laughter> , um, the people here tend to be a little more rude, and um it's just always a fast pace , well when i moved here i was twenty five so it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city you can have a lot of fun , and then i got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now i'm old and i'm not making any money so times are tough , no no i'm much <mu> much of more <m> more of an extrovert , um, when i don't get what i want <laughter> and um , rude people , and um , just inconsiderate people , i'm pretty good um at controlling my temper when i'm not uh like if i if i drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but uh <ss noise> when i don't drink i'm pretty good at controlling my temper , uh the last time i argued with somebody was , somebody that owed me money , uh i live uh in west hollywood , no no no i live alone i have a dog, it's good i mean i don't like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in are not that noisy and the ones below i just can't stand because they argue with me , huh, why because they 'cause my hardwood floors they say that, eh i've been there for ten years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors , yeah , what was the question , my mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track, she lived with me for the last ten years until she recently moved to rhode island to live with my brother, very close to my mother um not so close with my brother mm we're close but we're not like close close, um, so i mean we love each other we just don't really understand each other all the time , outgoing um, life of the party , ambitious um , and sometimes cut-throat , um <psh psh> what am i most proud of , being always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i wanna be, i'm generous i'm loyal, uh i'm friendly, i'm accommodating, and um , that's about it , no, yes , uh about four years ago , um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft, and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving, um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did , thank you , um okay i'm panicky about the job situation , um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now , so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation , yeah , um , yeah i mean , well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing , yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink , um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself, now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving , uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um, they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would , make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin , just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state , um not really , always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i, eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed, i do, at some point i've had, some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists , um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me, and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen , and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist, um, well i'm not going to therapy now but , the therapy that i had before um , was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication, um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better , um i just, i wasn't getting the right therapists recently, so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so , mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know , um , i can't really think of anything right now , um , it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy , thank you <sniffle>, um , okay when i was a kid, um , i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it , so then a little while later my father , came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them , so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that , oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences , yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so , um, just the way that i've treated people before when, i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people, when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so , so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable , get in a career that is really stable , like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney, something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so, you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things , um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work , uh when i'm helping other people , uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood , okay thank you , you're welcome thank you , bye",8
482,", yes, i'm fine., i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah, i was, i've never been there., um, i don't have any relatives there., i have no reason to go back there., um, <makes sounds with mouth>, well, my family's here., this is one, uh, the weather is great, uh the beaches and mountains are here, all these things are very good, uh, transport, that's probably <probab> probably say most people, um, it's expensive to live here., that's probably the first two, recently i've traveled, um, you get to see new places and new people, learn more about other cultures, and uh different ways people think, oh uh at the end of the march i went to ecuador for a week, uh, i spent most of the time one day with, with an ecuadorian who speaks only spanish and i speak very little spanish, so we have, it was a challenge for me to communicate with him, i felt like a little child., try to , you know you know what that is, what it is., it was very humiliating., um, you know, just see that, you know if you don't, if you're not able to communicate then that this can be very difficult, i'm probably more of a shy person., genetics i don't know why, i'm an electrician, so i studied electrical engineering., i also studied uh computer networking, um, it was, i guess.., just uh kind of circumstances, i needed, the, the work i did was not to care for the family, and, i knew someone who could get me a job at the electrical work and so i tracked it because of the financial gain, mm, it gave me a lot of opportunity., but i don't think that's what i want to do for the rest of my life., i'm going to be a missionary., uh my wife and i are looking at the move to ecuador in autumn, uh for four years, and last year we trained in north carolina, for one year, and that was like theology and bible training, um, essentially putting god, a um, a desire in my heart to go beyond, to get beyond myself and do something for other people, to go and, and learn about other people their culture, and to share the gospel with them, good in my immediate family, um, i'm married, i've been married for ten years, this june, and we have four daughters., and then, but i have an older brother, no sisters, um, what do you want to know about my family?, um, i'm really close to my wife and daughters, i'm not very close to my brother because he's mentally handicapped., he has the mental capacity of a seven year old., although he's five years older than me, so just because of this dynamic, it's hard to have a close relationship with him., but i'm pretty close to my parents my brother lives with my parents, um, i'd say my, my youth pastor in high school, he was a really positive influence in me, um, only he has a, he has a drive and a zeal for, for the persecution of the truth, um, and just.., study of the bible, and, and because of its influence this kind of, to want to study the bible, i think i've gotten better at it., there were, times in which, you know i'm getting angry., and uh, you know it can only, somehow really reign over me only the frustration, and i'm the kind of person that needs me, usually it takes some time until i get angry and some time to, to calm down again, but i did, i've learned.., over time, the really angry, and keeping that anger within yourself doesn't do it., it doesn't., attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at, just somehow attacks me, and so it's really not a it's not a good behavior to, to keep it that way, if things piss me off, i'll try, uh, how to talk to the other person tell you know that this situation makes me angry i try to talk through them somehow, and to resolve it and come to a resolution, to compromise even more than just, but try to really solve the root of the problem, to <sigh>, well, a, a few weeks ago or maybe it was even a month ago, um, my wife and i were on a trip with her parents, and her parents had already left, we just drove down., orange land area for this trip, and, my wife wanted her to expect certain things to be done before the trip, or that certain things be packaged., and, but had not really, in my eyes, she hadn't made that clear, but in her eyes she had, and so, when i tried to meet these expectations, they, um, you know i didn't get her after what she wanted and she got angry and so from my perspective i did what she wanted, and somehow being attacked for it., so, then i started yelling at her., and, and we know that we had this conflict, but then.., you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had somehow talked by, and we had found out what was the cause of this conflict, um, ask the moment during the conflict, uh, very you know only mm very angry you know that you can feel it, in the body, um, part i, which i guess, the, anger was probably the secondary answer, but my initial answer was that i felt that the feeling was attacked and that came out as anger, so, i'd think.., yeah so at first i felt attacked and then that led to anger, mm hmm, i guess it was.., decide to go, to go to our training last year, i felt that god had put my heart on me., that this was something i was supposed to pursue, my wife didn't feel that way, and, i, i just felt very strong that this was something we should pursue, and, but at the same time i knew that if my wife did not support it it would somehow fall apart, so, i kind of gave it up <r> gave it up, um, and i and i said to her, you know i'm not gonna force you.., you know, if you want to go, then we're going, but if not, then we're going to do something else, we're going to look at something else and we're not going., that was difficult for me because.., do you remember that kind of felt like a loss because i felt deeply that i should do what i should do?, um, but then, after i kind of gave it up, then, um, then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about doing this, and then we went ahead and persecuted it so, so it was kind of difficult for me to give it up, was <wa>, tell me about something bad or something i can erase from my memory, um, oh let me see, i'm not sure., i don't know, i can't really, think of something very traumatic, i'd want to delete it, but i think, they know good things and positive things and bad things they all somehowa, shape who we are, and, so i can't think of anything i want to delete, usually, it's not usually that bad., um, are you referring to the questionnaire where i said that i had problems < trou> some sleep disorders, um, the work that i work the way the planning has shifted, so that i, so lately i've been working some night shifts, or cemetery layers, so, um, come home in the morning, you know, when it's bright, it was hard for me to sleep., but it was mostly because i stayed up so late because of work., uh, it's pretty simple., um, if i don't sleep, then i'm gonna get crooked, uh, i've been feeling good lately, no, not really., no, no, um, hmm, i don't know., i can't think of anything that, the way of the ordinary, but, um, yesterday, we took my wife and i, took our three < th> our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest, to stay with her grandmother, but we took her to the park and they played., and, yes, so those are always happy times when we bring the children to the park, um, i think he'd say i'm a, a family father, that.., i'm sure he can count on me., usually my friend i'm doing at the end, um, various work around the house for him, because i'm a craftsman., so this way i think he'd say i'm kind of reliable or someone he could go to to advice, um, i guess i'd.., i guess i'd like to be able to, um, start conversations with people, simpler, sometimes, i'm in trouble., i'm just talking to people., especially if they're in a group, if people are one on one, then it's usually easier for me to talk to them., but somehow talking to people in a group, i wish i was a little better at it, now, if there is, all right., what i wanted to say before that was,, when i give a speech to a large group, i don't really have a problem with it, but if it's more interaction, it's kind of difficult., uh, advice i would have given myself ten or twenty years ago, um, probably it would have been to go to college immediately instead of going to school later in life., um, that's it., i thought that made the biggest difference., in my life i think, um, well, i have four children and, i hope i raise them right i hope that, that.., you know the mistakes i made, i can somehow lead them, through their journey in life and i hope that they, at the end a little, better for them than, when i, um, yeah, i just hope, hope somehow through them, that i can, you know, leave <lea> something rewarding, you're welcome.,

sort of thing, uh art history and marketing, uh well um, i became interested in high school and i thought it was a good um, classical education uh and, um, i interned at andy warhol's magazine when i was in high school and so, that, , hmm, yes, yes, uh, eh i'm pretty happy with what i'm i'm doing i do um consulting so, i write marketing plans that sort of thing, um, it's can be fairly hard, about writing a marketing plan, um, uh, i don't know it's hard it's hard to um <laughter> to talk to someone who's about it who's not in marketing it it requires just, um a knowledge of, uh, you know how it's how it how it's done and it it takes uh several months to to do one so, um, well i guess i'm i originally kind of shy but, um, i i become more outgoing just 'cause of work and stuff, um, i like to exercise uh i, i do um hiking with my dogs we walk up up and down a hill a couple times is it, good, uh, i don't remember, um, i don't know nothing comes to mind, mm, um sometimes i don't i don't clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and i feel bad when i i should always stay on top of that just getting to the car wash and stuff, uh, well i had a conflict with my brother, and so um i had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense and that was a a somewhat difficult, decision but just because of his angry behavior it wasn't it wasn't that difficult but um, you know it was <wa> it was somewhat difficult because i i loved him very much so, um, i'm not close to my family so, um, but i don't really have one, um i have a, a japanese friend uh oh i think the sensor came off i have a a japanese friend i'm i'm uh very close with she's like my kind of a my <m> my mother, and um, , uh, i just met them socially um, , uh i don't know nothing comes to mind, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, um pretty easy 'cause i keep a regular schedule, um just <jus> just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable, uh good, um well i'm recovering from p_t_s_d, so um i sometimes feel the the p_t_s_d and then i'll i'll take a medication for that, no it's just uh, it's just left over of the i'm still <sti> i still have the stress from it i'm still being treated for it, it i don't really have any, um i prefer not to talk about it, um in the past but it's treated, um, five years ago, uh i was i was just um very sad very depressed and so um i also had anxiety so i i went to, to doctor and um they helped me, and i did uh psychotherapy, yeah for the p_t_s_d though, um, i don't know i guess uh, it's just um, just kind of supportive because <be> because of the issues i have with my family it's it's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and um, you know it just uh gives me good feedback and helps me to make good decisions that sort of thing, i yeah i have nightmares about my family sometimes, yeah thanks, oh uh i i just try to uh sleep better i i i before i go to sleep i sort of, like um, meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help, i feel happy all the time pretty much like i my dogs make me happy and you know my life is really happy so, mhm, uh i guess you know as a a nice person i'm thoughtful, um a good friend um <sigh>, and happy fun person, um, i don't know i mean i'm in my forties now so i'm pretty happy with with myself my <m> you know my um, you know uh, i've i've done a lot of a lot of work on myself in in therapy and stuff so i'm pretty, i wouldn't really change a lot i'm pretty happy with myself i mean not to sound conceited but i'm i'm pretty um, happy with myself now, uh well <we> that would that would be um my parents they're very abusive so, i don't <d> i <d> i don't talk to them anymore so <laughter> um any you know any times with them you know they they uh, you know said <sai> did terrible things to me so, i prefer not to talk about it, uh let's see, um, well i just started reading a book i i like to read um cookbooks and i was just reading a book called um when french women cook and it's about, uh, a woman's relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and the and the cooking and so i'm really enjoying that book, mhm, um, i usually you know um get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places, and and do a bit of cleaning and um, uh just uh relax, oh, yeah i would <wou> i would say um, to have better self-esteem 'cause i used to have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so um, you know i i wish i'd been happier <ha> happier in the past and you know it's taken me a long time to become happy because, um you know no matter what what i did whatever achievements i i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know struggling with, being depressed i didn't <di> i didn't even know why and now you know i realize, because of whatever events that it that it was from my parents from that um a relationship and so, i my i what the advice would be to not um have a relationship that um, is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship, um, just just <j> the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know um, you know i i believe it like your deeds are very important and i try to treat people in a good way and, and i guess you know i'm i'm proud of you know with my work like decisions i've made that um, that give me um, you <y> you know a a a, a uh a job that i i like that gives me a lot of, flexibility and i you know i do what i like and <sigh> um, and you know people like my work and, um and also my my dogs i'm really proud of them and, um, yeah i guess <gu> i don't know <laughter>, mhm, okay, thank you, bye",1
368,"yeah, i'm fine with that., i'm fine., i guess.., , i'm basically a guy, cool, um, you know, the weather it's usually pretty sunny and temperate you know, i really like the climate a lot, i like the girls you know here., i like to see, i don't like the traffic you know, but, i like the hispanic population pretty well., and i have a lot of friends here, so i guess you know i don't want to be anywhere else, i mean, like i said, the traffic you know i was on the four on five, you know, that's always kind of you know crommy, the cost of living you really know, terrible about l a it's always expensive, and, you know i don't like it., i really don't like you knowing them., as it seems like to l a's one of those places where you are you know that you either know like one, a ton of money and fame and fortune or as you know that you know below in which you know the ghettos you are, i've been to a few places., uh, you know, but very briefly, you know, it was mostly for school., i went to arizona and new york and montana a lot of anthropology as you know and archaeology field trips and such things, uh, nothing i'm doing right now, i like to get away from the city that you know i was in yosemite last year you know summer for vacation that was kind of nice you know yosemite was really around, really nice to see, but uh just basically getting away from the city i guess you know away from work getting away from the stress here, uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics around, i'm a great kind of policy you know junkie you know to start with, so i naturally somehow fell in line with this type of study, it was me, but i lost my job., and you know that's kind of a moron that you know i lost it., oh, my god!, it's been a year and a half, now maybe two years and a half., um, you know that the economy got bad and budget cuts got bad, and you know i wish i'd work there again., uh, i wanted to be a lawyer, and i wanted to be a lawyer., and so i took political science and i took a double major in economics, and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i regret is that i know anyway you know to get into law school, you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats, and i studied for it how really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the test and like an idiot around i didn't feel right about the day it was a kind of day off, and you know, it was like you know the big game at the superbowl that you know, that i just don't feel like i did it well and i canceled the test and all that around, you know, i kind of regret that you know, <laughter> tell me about it, i'm not really shy, i'm definitely not shy., but starting i don't mean one of these people <peo> i'm not flamboyent you know i'm going to talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind, i'm meeting people who are good with me, but it's not like you know i'm dying to meet someone., i guess.., around these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar, um, i know i should have done more of it., but i also like to exercise around uh i'm on a diet right now, but my diet was terrible time eating habits were terrible, but the exercise part is just great i love to train <exerci> i love to run, this is one of my best things to do for stress is how to run and how to train, i just wish my eating habits were in line uh or a little better you know,, to <sigh> my temperament you might know definitely improved uh a lot you know to, you know many times i feel i'm one of those introverted guys people when it comes to how you know that i don't mind being extroverted or meeting people and like having a good time, whatever, when i'm angry, i really don't want you to talk to people i don't like screaming, i don't like screaming, i don't like beating, i don't like fighting, i kind of close up a lot, i don't just want to be left alone, sometimes i tend to put it on longer than it should be, you know, the woman doesn't like it too much, and maybe i know i just don't want to talk about it <laughter> i just don't want to deal with it., i kind of shut down and shut down, you know?, switch off for a little bit, oh, my god!, um, you know it doesn't happen too often., maybe with my wife, you know that we were probably something stupid that knows, who knows?, um, the, i mean, i don't have a lot of guilt, i'm not doing anything to make me feel like you know a person you know is bad., there are things that, as you know, i call minor sins, you know, i get white lies or whatever you know, but nothing like so disgusting that makes me feel guilty., um, let's see, i guess,, sometimes you know., you know, i'm a married guy, but i know sometimes there are times you know i like it, you know you're smiling at a girl, or, as you know, you're getting a girl's attention, you know, i don't know that i never go, i never do anything about it, i never get her phone number or as you know, but, sometimes i like it, talk to people, i guess, you know, that's a good question., i guess.., i guess you know i always do the same thing, there's not that i never want to change, i never want to deal with things differently, i'm always pretty comfortable how i deal with things and you know i think i could be much worse and as you know, screaming and screaming and beating and that and that and that and that, and that's just not me, you know, i think the best you know is kind of like, get a lot of breathing space a lot of space and around i don't want that to change or treat any of it differently i just don't basically know what else to do, you know., and you know, the last thing i want to do is talk about feelings, or talk about anything that you know that's the last thing i want to do, and like i don't want me to treat something like that differently., you know, i'm pretty happy with my family now, you know, if i'm married and we have a baby on the way, which is kind of beautiful, around we have a few cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and around my mother i love my mother intimately, um, she has diabetes that she doesn't control., you know, she doesn't control it and likes it how uh it affects her health and it always worries me about her and how stress about her and she could do so much to prevent it and she doesn't and, i have a good relationship with my mother, i love her very much and i really have a good relationship with everyone i think, i think i've got a ton of family and friends around, who get along pretty well with me, you know actually, yeah, that's good., there are times that are good. i mean, it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep. i feel like you know i'm sleeping like a baby., the only problem i have, i think, is i feel, how you know sometimes how you fall asleep and you're just going to sleep and you're kind of like a yolk you know how you almost like a case, anyway it's like a falling feeling or something, and it doesn't happen so often, but it happens, and around but for most of the time <ti> part by no i sleep like a stone i sleep really well, well, right now, i've felt in general., worry and and fearful and, you know, uh, and tense and the reason why is because i said my mom to right, at least today, well, i found out that my mother did something that she didn't tell me the whole story, and i kind of wait until this is over so we can figure out what's wrong with her., but.., you know, i'm worried about her, she's in the hospital, she's with the doctors right now, so that doesn't tell me anything good., and to you know to try to find a job, so that also got me worried, and you know the baby on the way, so i got worried, so i feel like a sharp inhalation you know, overwhelmed with a just a lot of how you know how to do things and how, and, much on my much on my plate and how much of it has nothing to do with me, but i have to treat it the way you know, the way i think, well, i keep distracted i keep myself busy i feel like a busy body you know, and the more it seems like you know it seems like it's not a good thing because i feel i'm just adding more things on my plate, so, um, you know how one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to train every day that you know, but that takes an hour, as you know, change and you just start to run and how to go through the whole thing of stretching and cooling, which takes some time and then like to shower, all the kind of stuff takes time, so i have to do it every day so that i can finish it this way, i also finished knowing you're playing guitar, but that only, more of a distraction that you know what i mean, keep you know to keep busy as it seems simple as if it wasn't, you know to work towards you, know the goals, you know i have to do as you know i can find a job i should do, but then.., you know, it's one of those things where i don't think there's any good jobs i've been looking for and looking for, and sometimes when i do, it's just not what i want to do, it just doesn't seem, for example , <laughter> as i want uh, make one of these like terrible jobs, i xx it's you know it's it, probably harder than i think about it, because sometimes i feel like, you know, one of these things is like, uh.., i feel like it's hard, but it's not i mean, there are ways to deal with it, you know, i kind of have to accept that you know that i sort of internalized it., and how uh you know, it's not something that's like i'm not out on the street or something like that, but you know it's a concern., i've never diagnosed with p t s d i worked with., no, no, man, ten years ago, <laughter> i don't know, uh, see, the last time i was really happy maybe, i mean nothing, i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know i learned to feel a new song on the guitar <fe> i feel like, i'm not even happy that you know i'm like.., you know, i work sometimes and that makes me happy that you run as fast as you know, but that doesn't make me so excited or anything., i just feel good., you know, so i have this this, in those times when i'm just you know i'm feeling good, about me and i feel, you know, but i never feel great i never feel happy i never feel as sensational as you know and you know it, i can't believe you know it's just.., you know there are these mild times when there are some good times., you know and a few bad times, but the good times are never <n> never <ne> never extremes, you never know really good times and never really terrible bad times you know, well, i wish this diet would work a little better you know, but that's kind of hard you know because i like the kind of guy that just likes, who likes you to know about you, rice and how uh mexican food and how <sharp inhalation> you know to and to snack and uh, i don't know, i just feel like i could change i wish i could change my eating habits as i can, as you know, because i'm learning so much that i feel like i'm running as much and doing as much activity as you know., that if i mean you know diet in check around, you know this would go a long way, i wish i could change you, too., my <m> my, my uh, i guess my, i feel like the economy is so bad., and how things are so rough that, you know, it's like pointless, even if you know looking for this kind of jobs like, it just seems like i just wish i had a little more inspiration to like a lot more motivation, to <laughter>, <sigh> does things, the one thing i regret is not, is not to you know is this lsat thing you know about, you know, i can't cancel the test to start it, because i'm sure i could have gone to a school, but then, as you know, it made me think that i really want to pay a bunch of how you know law school and the cost of it and how, you know, just to.., just to be stacked with more work and so on anyway, i don't know it just doesn't seem like, how uh, i mean, there's an idea of justice and, and around and republicanism, and you know things that i really know you, stick to, that i fall in love with, and that i don't want to get away, but it seems like it's a lot of work and money., and easy to like it for the small percent of success,, that you know that maybe you don't really make such a field that you might know that maybe i just don't like, it's worth overcoming the obstacles i have to overcome, ugh < sigh>, i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wu> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe, um, you know, i think i've done everything really well for myself, except for the lsat thing you know which i'm going to do., you know the regrets on one side on the other, you know, i'm not sure i regret it because of the bills and all the stuff i told you about,, and you know, i think you know that i was waiting to get married, that i was waiting for a kid., i've known you pretty carefully about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these things like things like you know that, i think that real people know,, and then she really as you know ruin her life you know like, i'm pretty happy and satisfied with, you know the godfearing whom you know., uh, i don't know., oh, my best friend, i think he kind of likes me <li> he likes me he wants me to do more things with him, but he works at night, and you know it's one of those things i think most people not only have my best friend, but my wife and maybe the rest of my family., feel that i don't put much, time and attention to them i mean, they think i'm pretty great when i give them the, time of the day and my attention, but i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know, i don't know if i'm real, you know, i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something else, i don't know if i can really give them a real one., you know, shoulder to cry, or you know, if you ask for something you know, i'll usually do it., you know, but i almost feel like it's like a job, like you know, like she's.., you know, if they really need me, then i'll do it, you know, if they're just asking for a favor, i almost feel like you know i'm doing it., i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate them or anything i really like, it's just that i have the feeling, i almost don't want to say that i owe it to them, but the mere fact that i'm her boyfriend somehow makes her.., you know, uh, as i do it anyway makes me, as you know, they rely on me some you know times or how i don't want to let them down they're my friends, but it's the same time, i just feel like it's, it's more it's not it's not it's more like doing a job instead of a job., a willingness like an oh my god, as i just want to help you, it's never <ne> it's never that it's just something i do because i somehow have to know you need to know, i have to do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know, and i end up like them, and they'd probably do it for me., and i know you, so i just.., well, there are a few things i like that i have good <go> i feel good about myself you know, you know i ran the marathon that feels good., i graduated from college that feels good, you know what i mean, but the thing is, i don't feel that way., like pride in myself, because you know these things alone, like studying from college, you know i didn't really succeed, you know what i mean., um, running the marathon didn't make me thin and trim, so they're like half the merits, you know, or how they are, they're great, you know, lotta people may not have done half way, a lot of people have gone beyond each other., but.., you know, they're kind of like kickstones that like, that around i seal real new no, life < l>lifelong, benefit from other than the fact that i can say that i have done, yeah yeah no problem no problem thanks for your time you know to hope you enjoy you know uh in this computer, oh, goodbye., i'm gonna press this button now",7
300,"good, atlanta georgia, um my parents are from here um, i love it, i like the weather, i like the opportunities, um, yes, um, it took a minute, somewhat easy, congestion, that's it, um i took up business and administration, uh yeah i am, here and there i'm on a break right now but i plan on going back in the uh next semester, uh probably to open up my own business, no, um no specific reason i just, don't travel a lot, i'm pretty local, once a year, can you be a little bit more specific, no answer, i like reading books i enjoy i enjoy cooking, um exercising is great, i'm i'm i'm pretty good at it, um, yeah, um probably about, two weeks ago, uh frustrated, um, i don't like bias, um i don't like um when someone says they're gonna do something and they don't, uh somewhat, friendship, i like to play sports i enjoy uh going out with friends and family, playing games, grandparents, parents, um yeah i mean they've always given me great advice, they've always kept it real, real close, i would say going to college right after high school, well i would've been done by now you know, i would have been probably out in the field, in the career field, uh taking a job off the street, i'm sure i could've yes, i'm not sure, maybe when i graduated from high school, well uh i um i got my diploma, my my diploma that i finished school and i met all the requirements , high school, and i was approved to go, do whatever i wanted to do, living with who, um it's alright it could be better, not, no, uh it's pretty easy, uh yes, repeat that, irritated um, lazy, no, no, no, no, um the other day, weather was great sun was out, different, less, less um, interested, uh shut down, uh about two weeks ago, uh yeah a friend of mine was annoying me and i just, cut them off, [laughter] it's alright, friendship, chocolate, tall, thin, thank you, bye bye",2
449,", all right., yes, i am., i'm good, thank you., < slaughter>, originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america, yes, the weather around i like that i can come to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just get any element i want to get, i can get, traffic <laughter> busy everyone is always in a hurry to, that's what this is about., < slaughter>, if i can have family in central america and if i try my husband and i,, go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean, the freedom not to have my daily routine and not to be guilty of not doing something i said i would do when i'm home and when i'm too far away from home to do it, then i have nothing to fear <laughter>, recently i went back to honduras, that's where my family came from., so it was kind of like a it's a double fold i get to see my family, but i also somehow get to be away from home, so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that somehow i can still have my freedom, and i don't feel obliged to be with them, so it's more fun this way, experiences on holiday or, for the most memorable experience, probably hawaii in lahaina and only with i love eating i'm a foodie so, to let the pig roast under the ground and just eat it so that i could never taste it as usual, so it's like a memory, it's a deep memory for me, because, no matter what i do with my pig, it will never taste like the pig in lahaina <laughter>, business and that was years ago, so i ended up in marketing, so i enjoyed i my business background has helped me in marketing, my dream job, hmm, well, i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook, and the only reason i hesitate is because i love cooking, but i just do it for home and friends and family, if it turns into, if it turns into a job, i feel like it just won't be as happy or i wouldn't have as much fun as i did you know how i've got now, but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and joy i have in cooking now every day, then that would be my dream job, i'm going out., < slaughter>, <laughter> that's cool <laughter>, uh depends on where i am when i'm where i'm actually the first thing i do is just somehow get a grip of myself that i'm always in control no matter where i stand by, and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e, so i just take a deep breath to assess my situation., find out what i can control, what i can't control and then proceed from there, but just breathe some sort of deep breath and get me under control., i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild tempered to start with, i'm not really getting upset., and so when i just feel hot all the time or when i just react i just like i said i just, do my own little self control you know, before i may have kissed, i might have gone for a second, but i'm saying my own little self control and just you know what comes on no that's mm it's not worth it, this person isn't worth it, the situation is not worth it, be who you are and just stay there, actually it was with my husband and we went back and forth about my relationship with my father and i tried to get a point about him and he was just somehow missing my feelings in it, and i wasn't wanting him to overlook my feelings and act like i didn't feel the way i felt, so i stressed my point in different ways, and then i found myself in a debate now and then, when i withdrew and said, no look babe that's how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel different i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings, when i came to my own conclusion, i felt triumphant because, the point of argument in my mind was to clarify how i didn't feel for him to force his you know he's very a macho somehow male guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic, and so i said no as long as i felt better because i felt undestooded and i felt heard, let's see., i can come to my son's mind that he's twenty two years old., and he's got a very alienated relationship right now and it's okay, i'm okay with it., he used to be a little more needy, so he thought i'd always look for or call him., unlike waiting for him to call me, and i think, it may be a very strange answer, but i wish i was his mother early in my life, which i would have somehow adapted so that he wouldn't wait so comfortably for me to be the one who comes, and look for him, he doesn't live with me, he has his own place., but waiting for me to be the one looking for him, and you know you're trying to make sure he's okay, i think that's probably much more ethereal than you meant, but, i would have done it differently, i would have mothered him differently on the way and released him at an earlier age, which means that i would have treated him more from an adult., and then he doesn't expect him to just somehow know you,, i would have killed the expectation in him that i would contour him if that made sense., woo < laughter> no it's not easy, you have to sacrifice and about just physical things you just need to make sure that your child's needs are in front of your own and, i guess the second part of this answer is that it's easy once you realize that as long as they're okay, you're okay, so, my son, my daughter, they both know that i love them unconditionally., so, my upbringing has become easier the more i have lived in this truth, where i expect nothing from them, but then expect no disrespect., as long as we have this clear line of communication, whatever still happens, falls under this category of respect, see them, maybe make decisions i wish they wouldn't uh it could be as easy as an outfit <laughter> you know, choice or as much as a career change, but i have to sit back and watch them listen, be open and then just, somehow just be there you know if they want to talk about it, but then also try not to manage it because i was also her age and i must remember that, i didn't want to be managed and even if i made a mistake, i didn't want to be judged, so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on my own, and just kind of just waiting around and luckily it's nothing important with my kids, but, whatever this personal downfall is just kind of being there and not one i told you i told you so about ghost on me, it fills the knowledge that you know i created the one you know i planned my two kids, so it's just a real one., it's an honor that i could do it, it's an honor that they're healthy., and it's fun to see them grow up to their own., and it's like they're mini me's, but then they're different than i am and so it's just fun, be able to allow them who they are and just celebrate as they are, so i enjoy the, wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties around i was born in the year after they arrived here, so their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle anyway which wasn't a bad thing, it's just that their upbringing style was more about making sure we have a home to make sure, uh we had the accommodation of course and food and clothing and schooling, but there wasn't really much time for my mother's relationship with my daughter as a daughter or my father's relationship with me as a daughter, so i had to figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent., i wanted to divorce my first husband because i would be the one who overthrew the whole situation.. he was a good father, just not a good husband for me., and after twenty years, i knew that i was going to be the one who said it wasn't working for me anymore., and, since i did that the domino effect was <ha>, it wasn't virtual, it happened <laughter> we sold our house, you know, split up the assets and then live apart and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while, and then i made some decisions where i didn't want to go through so much trouble, so i just.., has a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else, so it was just a very hard decision by, how it affected my children, that's all i care about losing everything, physical and all the material that might be less important to me, but it was hard because i knew it would affect my children, and they were the only thing that worried me., uh my husband and i didn't know you saw eye to eye on certain things regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a woman and that's just who i am and those were the areas that, he didn't confirm me because he somehow saw me as a partner who financed his extracurriculars, whether it was just traveling or whatever the case, i'm not here to talk about it., whatever he did was outside of you that you know the sanctity of our house., and i was tired of just you know work and he benefits from everything, but then not fulfilled as a woman or a woman and he wasn't ready to change despite all the advice we went through, and i thought well that this didn't work for me and i had to take care of myself first and i had low self esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love me, to love my children and then to get the love i should get in return., < slaughter>, you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just know you're good bad ugly or no matter what mistake i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day, my goal in life is to just rest, so when i have my head in the night, i'm just wondering if you knew i did something that i was ashamed of, that i ran over someone today., have i not known, and i am not holy or acting as if i am pollyanna, but i believe in karma, i'm a god fearing woman, so i just want to make sure i've done everything i should do today., and if there's something i can correct, you know, i'll just do it one point to promise me,, go back and correct it or at least learn from it and just don't make the same mistake on another day, really good light, you know, had some rough spots with the family individually as i said with my son, my daughter is a teenager, so somehow she comes into her own, so that's another relationship she's against me, i'm actually very looser, very bohemian style, she's very social you know, just out there, so somehow i need to find our balance, but overall it's just i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simple lifestyle, that i'm just kind of on my own care every day and i just enjoy my little, mini services, whether someone sees them or not, < slaughter>, no, i didn't thank god., no, really happy let's see, it's at home and i think it was when, wow, <mumble> different things that run around my mind, i think when my daughter and i got my teenage daughter and i got to understand <underst> anyway understanding on, our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend, but that doesn't mean she can't talk to me., and i think when she came to me the other day and gave me a big hug from behind me, without really saying something that i really felt, how she accepted herself, and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is, how she is, so it was a very, only she and i knew about it, but there was only one luck that nothing else could ever give me., < slaughter>, thank you., i'm reckless, i'm just very funny., you know, to any chameleon comes to mind, i just kind of acquislimate what kind of situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and only you know, brave when i have to be, i'm just very grown up i'm a grown woman and you know they'd just describe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that they're on extremely reliable i do as i say what i do, and all i know is that i don't know., i don't care about b s < laughter>, what could i change about myself?, uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what are some things that i would change about myself, uh, sounds weird that i wouldn't say much about anything really, i think i'd be easy, a little more conscious of others i think i'm one i'm super sensitive to others, but i think i'd just be more conscious, make sure i'm not selfish or i'm not tuning someone out just because i want to get through my yoga or i want to do something else, i think i'd just be more attentive and aware of those around me to make sure i don't insult someone, i have no regret that i think all the time and you know it's natural to go back and say if i have in this situation with the mindset i now what i would do, but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me, so i don't know, take advantage of it very well and then turn around and call it a regret, because i know i've learned from it, it probably sounds very textbook, but that's true, it's just how i live, so i think that, everything that happened well bad ugly or indifferent, for a reason i really believe that and my job is to take away from it, what i should take from him and take that into my future, so i'm going to take that you know, the hard knocks with the joys, hmm, be really with myself, this is one thing that took me twenty years to get somehow just to be kind of honest with me to hug who i am, to learn who i am uh learn my own infrastructure, be content with the innate things that are part of me., do not try <re> to revamp, don't try to renovate me or try to become something i'm not, uh i would still have chosen the same marketing career to still i would still have climbed the same company leaders, but i would have done it from an inner place, not that i would have lost myself in it., but if in relation to my family life i would simply have been more faithful to myself and so i would have had no kind of resentment, my family my uh my role as wife my role as mother i think that ultimately that's where my most important fulfillment comes from, because no matter what, at the end of this life, this life is this body in this leased vehicle., that i'm in around everything i'm going to do or all i'm going to be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cement chamber, , and i'm always just, true to that i mean, i was always faithful to that from the time i was eighteen and realized, i wanted to be married and have a family and children and all that, i think that ultimately that's where my true fulfillment comes from, < slaughter>, cool, thank you., see you.",2
470,", yes, i'm fine., i'm out of los angeles california, the food the weather and the people, mm, um, i don't know that there aren't too many things i might not like about l a., some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in l a, < slaughter>, not too much, i was just like texas las vegas and, that's pretty much all., mhm, um, catching a plane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my father, and, go to read vegas a lot, this is, oh, yeah, good., when i was younger, i went to my father and because he lived in houston texas and i often caught the plane, and that was a lot of fun i wasn't afraid that was a lot of fun, and i enjoyed that <laughter>, when i went to school, i studied child development and nursing., um, i know i wanted to be someone, and when i went to school, i wasn't sure what i wanted to be., so i first maintained the l v n program., and then i didn't want to be a nurse, so i changed my main subject to child development and i graduated., no, i'm actually looking for work. i'm unemployed right now., my dream job would be, probably work with the children who open a nursery or something that is my own business, in my head it's simple, but as in reality it seems like it's kind of difficult <laughter>, sometimes i'm shy, but i'm really an outgoing person and a human person, hmm, < slaughter>, to relax, i listen to slow music that i kind of like., have a quiet environment, and maybe lie down a little t v or something, i'm very good at controlling my temperament, i don't like getting really angry or angry, or, come to the place where, i'm fit to hurt someone <laughter>, um, if i really have arguments that they are because people don't agree to contradict., and then it's over how really petty it is like, we could say oh, it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion, so we're arguing about it, but there's nothing really big or something like that that it's just stupid, i don't even remember <laughter>, um, i need a job <laughter>, yes, um, maybe <sigh>, i don't really remember a situation i'm trying to really think about before i really do a situation and i'm trying to handle it in my best positive way, before i really do something i regret, to be with someone like a guy you know when i want to continue a relationship with them., or just, to be single, mm, um, my relationship with my family that i don't have, i just stay with my dad and i have a daughter, and we just stay close to my whole family, they're either in.., houston texas, or, they're close, but i'm not joining many of my family., my father, because i'm living with him right now, i might have lived with him for five to six years., and, he's just the only one i really look up to, i don't really have anyone around me to look up to, and, that's it <laughter>, , she's in fifth grade, she's graduating, she's in sixth grade, and i'm kind of excited about it., sometimes it's easy, but uh sometimes it gets a little overwhelming, the hardest part about being a parent is being a single parent., it's just that you always have someone who brings you joy, i always enjoy things to do with my daughter, it's all about making a lot of sacrifices and just always, it brings me so much joy to be a parent, all right., to my parents when i was younger, they, lived apart, so my mother, i don't know that i'm a much better parent because i'm more interested in what my child wants to do, i'm involved in her life, they only take every step, i'm really fully involved my parents wasn't really that you know they had a drug problem, so it's easy, i had to mature much faster than many other children, so, it was, um, only, my parents and.., her drug addiction i wish i could erase this from my memory, to cope with them now, well, when i grew up, it was just rough, it was very rough., had to do a lot of things on your own, they weren't involved in my choices in life., i didn't know how i really grew up and be a child and what way to go or anything it was easy as if i was alone in a world, yeah, that's good., oh it's very easy i sleep well every night i can sleep whenever i sleep very well, um, a little sad but most of the time i'm very happy i'm just not happy with where i'm in my life right now, um, not really i really try to think very positively and try what i can do every day to look for work and, just stay positive and focused, no, i didn't., no, i didn't., the last time i felt very happy was when i finished college, i felt very happy that this was one of the best things that happened in my life and, that was the last time i was really very happy., i felt like i was on top of the world i felt like, only, overwhelmed by joy only, everything was just so exciting for me that day i was just very happy nothing could upset me that day i was very happy and when i think about that day it just, it's a very happy experience for me, um, right now, i don't really have a best friend., i'm really trying, i'm, i tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they didn't really make a lot of positive decisions, so right now i'm just like, um, i really don't have any friends right now., for my personality, um, i'm, a happy person i am an outgoing person, and, a positive person, and, a good mother, around uncertainties like around sometimes i feel like, i have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something i feel like i can't get through something i can't., sometimes come to the next step or, only, malaise, sometimes, well, i had a girlfriend and she was like bipolar, and i tried to really be her friend, no matter the illness she had, but, she wasn't a really good friend because she, one day she started., only, um, to be very negative and just to talk about me as if we were enemies and everything and, it didn't really feel bad about me, but it just made me choose my friends very smart, yeah just friends with certain people who don't have positive things with themselves or just, not only when i notice things about people who should determine whether i want to be their friend or not, you know that maybe she, bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that this is a red flag and i shouldn't be this one, friends <laughter>, yeah, that's good., to stay in school, stay positive and stay focused and surround me with good positive people, and only, stay on the right track, well, i left., to a friend's house that i haven't seen since childhood., and they, there were only a lot of people over there., and they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed seeing my old friends i didn't see in a long time, and just with, my family and, certain friends i really enjoyed because i'm really always in the house i really don't go out so often, so i enjoyed it, with, a group of friends and family and enjoy themselves, yeah, that's good., i'm proud of you., the, i got my g e d i graduated., and i want to be someone and i'm very proud that i want to be a better parent than my parents, thank you very much <laughter>, goodbye.",3
424,"hi, yes, today is a wonderful day i am doing just absolutely marvelous, i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to los angeles when i was sixteen years old, yes, mm uh i've only been back once since i left, it's a whole another, community, when i was growing up i'm so glad i grew up there because it was a great sense of community which i think we don't have here in los angeles <sniffle>, uh my my grandmother died and left property for my father, so we came here to manage her property property, uh it was pretty easy for me i was still young, and it was easy to adapt so i'm pretty good at meeting people so uh that has never been a problem i traveled a lot as a child, so i was used to moving and going to new places, meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life, oh one of my best trips i had it was in, nineteen i'm dating myself but nineteen sixty four <sniffle> i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland, ohio and i went to an indian reservation, and i got a little note card about the reservation when i got back home i wrote to the reservation and i told them i when i came <ca> went back to school in september i would have to write, uh deliver a speech rather about what i did over the summer and i told them i wanted to, talk about going to the indian reservation and would they send me something and they sent me this, huge, kachina indian doll, and that was <wa> that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if i still had it i found out like a quarter of a million dollars so, mm, but that's one of the best , um i could be a little bit of both, um i'm pretty when i have to be i can be outgoing 'cause i'm good at meeting <mee> talking to people and meeting people but sometimes i have a little bashful side a little shy side of me too so, so a little bit of both, i studied business administration <ad> administration with a uh emphasis in marketing and advertising, um well i really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't this what it is today, and um i liked <li> i was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and i love people, so i wanted something that would bring me, interaction with people so i went into marketing, and i was working for a t_v station where i was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so, no now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer i shoot a lot of stars, i shoot on the red carpet, i shoot a lot of special events and anything else people will pay me for <laughter>, it's not hard at all it's my passion i love it it's like not working, i'm in my dream job, i i just need to get more, jobs <j> jobs to that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as a photographer you have to do a lot of things <thin> events for free to get known, so it's a building process of relationships so i'm still in that process of building relationships, so that i can get more paid jobs but this is my dream job i love what i do, well now i'm really back into it i used to do it a while then i got away from it but it's meditation, i practice meditation and i try to do it twice a day in the morning, and at night before i go to sleep i work with oprah and deepak chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and i use that to, calm my body, um i can generally control my temper sometimes i get set off i guess like any other human person <per> being but i work at trying to keep a moderate and temperate, uh temper in personality, oh wow we i argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her, but it obviously did, and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her mm and maybe what i said did, and that's what started the argument, oh god i felt terrible because i i never intended to hurt my daughter, and i never would wanna hurt her, and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said so i had to have to guard my words and watch my thoughts, well i don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me, and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughter's a makeup artist and i'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so, sometimes i think we're up on each other too close, we need a little more space, yeah when i say the wrong things <laughter> it's, no it's never easy to be a parent it's a work in progress, making the right decisions about things sometimes, the love the feel the feeling of accomplishment, that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet, to be a a, uh wonderful and productive human being, i'm not as strict as my parents were i give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are, um i'm not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual, um so i brought them up different from me on the religious tip, and um, i'm more i listen more to them i think than what my parents did it was, you were to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids' voice be heard, one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know wanna go into details i feel bad about that night <laughter>, yeah i could've stayed home <laughter>, wow i'm trying to think about a situation, maybe the handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i could've handled that a little differently, well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to a, a end and the way we separated was kind of explosive, and i think both of us could've handled it better but i think i played a part in in keeping a lot of drama going, 'cause i was hurt that we were breaking up and kinda devastated 'cause i wanted my child to be raised with her father, so i think it looking back now which is you know hindsight is twenty twenty vision, i could've handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you'd do better, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, the hardest decision i've ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke, was going to make an a connection, and, to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me, and he told me, that i could not get on that plane, because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself, i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on, to montgomery alabama where we were headed, and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go, but my life was in the balance, so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one <sniffle>, ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week, and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work, and i'm on a plane and i feel this, weird feeling coming over the left side of my body, and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong, it was it was when you to your life, and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's gonna happen next so it was very disturbing, very traumatic, and i you know you don't know what's happening to you it's so the weirdest thing riding to, the hospital in a, medical ambulance, that was a weird experience, yeah but i'm here, i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so, the universe wasn't finished with me yet, you know what that's sometimes i have a little problem with it um, sleeping a little bit sometimes i, i get wired up <laughter> i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head, um i'm sluggish, um probably a little on edge, but i try and keep a a upbeat personality i'm a real energetic person, so i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you, so, lately i've been feeling really well um except, i've been having some, problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't but i'm so grateful to be alive, that that is really minor <mi> minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't, fortunately <for> fortunately, my i didn't lose my facial structure or, you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use, but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work, um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat, energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful, no but i went through depression, uh from being knocked unconscious five times when i was a school teacher, every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from, having like sleep apnea and not being able to sleep, from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head, so, no only i don't go to therapy because, um i don't i don't have any medical right now so i'm not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical, it's hard to get it <sniffle> and then i don't i'm not working <work> yeah it sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability, so that i can, get well, 'cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing, so that's kind of depressing, to think after all the years i've been working since i was sixteen and it's taking me it's been over a year it was a year, i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i won't have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i, get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year, and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job, and my life is kinda up in the air right now, 'cause i'm wondering what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance <sniffle>, i feel happy every day every day i wake up, and i can breathe and i can see, and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph i'm happy it's just a good thing, to be in the present moment and to be alive <sniffle>, mm you know what i figured like what good are regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now, so just live <li> move forward, mm what advice would i give myself <sniffle> don't let anything get in your way, you know keep a good personality and a energetic spirit and just keep pushing, energetic talkative, uh won't take no for an answer uh follow through reliable, um good spirited, giving loving, um i'm most proud of that, i have been able to find out my creative side i've been a visual artist i never took a art lesson before, i taught art <sniffle> um i was, in my late twenties before i even discovered that i could draw and paint, um i'm a doll collector, uh i'm i'm my creative side is what i'm most proud of because it's been able to help me, being creative i can no matter what even when i i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out, and just go take pictures and that was so, soothing to my soul, that i'm i'm i'm glad that i have a creative side and that i found it and have utilized it, mhm, uh huh, and that's is that it bye bye, bye",3
436,", yes, i'm fine., uh mexico, when i was seven years old, i've been there three or four times on vacation., i don't know if it's because i'm on vacation, but.., i feel more at peace there than here, well, my uh family moved down here for a better life uh that were my parents, mm just the weather and the different things you could do, you could be on the beach or you could go into the mountains to do different variety of things, traffic and sometimes yeah basically traffic and yeah that's one of the most important things, not so much i was in new york and uh mexico just, uh just uh new places to see and find new places you know something new, as for a trip or, well, i was in mexico, i was in the pyramids of.., i forgot what it's called in mexico city., and i like you to know about uh find about my old culture since i'm uh uh mexican from mayan aztec so i like to see different things like this, good uh at school, well, i got uh out, but i came back and i'm trying to get back into it now trying to learn uh graphic designs, well i started to like you know to take photos different things and i know as you, i go into business i like what it justifies over, i want to make my own business either web pages just be able to be free, and don't rely on anyone else, just be able to have freedom for me, outward, well, i like that you know., to be people who like to get to know people and depend on the person how i feel about them, i like to listen to music or you know, do different things like play sports or do different things just to relax, well, i'm getting better at it, you know, i , well, it was like uh, two days ago it was something about uh i had to pay a bill or something < some> something that uh i know i've been around, but the person he is like more picky about it you know he's more, you know how girls are you know they want everything right there and then, i've handled it you know i've got it all there and they just annoy sometimes they don't give you the room, that you have to solve something, i felt overwhelmed i had already solved it i was just waiting for, a check you know, it's not my control, but i've already made the right arrangements and she bugs me about it and it's like, you imagine an argument that you know a storm in a glass of water., it's like mhm., all right., there are some of them, but not so recently, because i'm more, try to get my life together, but the decisions i made in the past, like early school leaving and other different things to do, mm, don't blame so much because, not really, not that i could think directly of my head, the toughest decision, oh, it's just not on my head right now, an event, the only things i remember are when i'm black or other things like that i don't remember., but, not anything like a certain only when my uh brothers died and various things like this, mhm, well, my brother was in gangs and different things and he got more in trouble, and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about a lot coming in, no, i'm hispanic, you know, i like being with my family., and you know i like going to mexico, i have a half sister, and my grandpa died, he was over there in mexico., so i like having a good relationship with my family., all right., my mom and dad they always work hard they always did what they had to do to pay the bills, that's why sometimes i'm running around as you know trying to do everything, but done properly don't try to take the easy way out, it's a little hard because it's mostly here in los angeles there's a lot, different things you could get into are not so positive, and it's hard to focus on you knowing the right things to stay, well, usually i just knock out, it's not that hard, it's like it takes me half an hour or fifteen minutes, but.., sometimes i can't even wake up with the alarm., you need to wake me up, you know my girl needs to wake me up, even if the alarm starts., hard so you know i just knock out, i get a little bit either i'm angry or i don't feel good and i'm not filled with energy, but i still need to know that i have to do something to keep going through it., i was good i felt good you know, was a little restless, but i didn't have to do that much, all i know is you made me do it no matter how i feel., no, nothing unusual, no, no, the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know, going with a, going out have some fun and you know that i was drinking and just relaxing, and winding <win>, mhm, my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either outside or at home just relax, but nothing else you know just be able to relax and relax with it you either go somewhere to a beautiful place or stay at home, but without any calls or interruptions you know only to be able to turn off the phone and turn everything off just, with her to do the other different things, mhm, uh like an outgoing guy you know very socially, but at the same time i'm reserved depending on how i feel with people, you need to know, build trust or feel comfortable with them, oh, i'm changing a lot you know like, uh my temper and various things drink things i am, change a little different things so i could get more different things done, oh, there are several, but mostly uh, when i come from mexico, they want you to be different down there, it feels like silly because i went to a store where i was dressed regularly., and i told them i wanted to buy something and then they said that, that i don't belong there and i and as soon as they saw my credit card, they somehow changed perspective because they saw the wells fargo logo that they know i was american, but they thought it was the way you know it., it was <wa> it made me feel ridiculous because you're going to a place and you've got the money you're asking for something, you're going to ask for something because you don't just have to waste it <wa> kill their time, just because they saw a card logo, that's how they know you, it was just ridiculous for me, no, basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school, and you don't know that you know you're trying to control my temper and do different things, because if i knew what i know now, it would be different., well, i ran away, but i went back to school and i know i got high school., and right now i'm in the process of doing other things so now is uh getting my high school getting that together, and right now i'm working on another goal trying to you know that mine either go back to school, so it's basically <ba> back to school and graduating from high school of g e d, mhm, all right., you're welcome., see you.",0
428,"<synch>, <laughter>, yeah, i'm good how are you, i'm from here <he> um from los angeles, <clears throat> probably the downtown the view, and it's not that i like it but that's just where i for my parents were so that's where i grew up, nothing that's where i live i i love l_a <laughter> maybe that it's ghetto but that's about it <laughter>, <clears throat> i was thinking of going for sound engineer or mechanic, hmm but i'm not sure, <clears throat> 'cause <cau> 'cause my dad um he used to do that, mm i'm not even sure to be honest, haven't really thought about it, i can't look at your

guess, i don't know, <laughter>, about what shy or, outgoing, <clears throat>, well outgoing you could be outgoing at a party you know like you're already out there so you can't be shy i guess if you're going to a party, good, probably um, my girlfriend and 'cause i missed work 'cause i just felt lazy, i was like whatever you know i just didn't wanna go and i, i do what i want <laughter> i just didn't go, nah not really, she's over it already, as long as we have the bills and rent paid <laughter>, don't worry, guilty, probably nothing, i guess i should've gone to work <laughter>, mm <clears throat>, damn that i could erase from that, probably bad friends that i've met you know, like friends that trick you you know that said that, that they just trick you friends that deceive you i guess, okay like um, my friend told me that he had a good job at some car wash place so he told me to to he's gonna, get me hired there and give me direct deposit but then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account, so, <laughter>, <clears throat>, probably moving out and into my mom's house, yeah i haven't really been around eh like a big decision like that, i wanted my own space you know my own life i wanna do what i want and come home when i want leave when i want, yeah <laughter> yeah <laughter>, uh we're all close we're all you know we hardly argue we're all always around we always see each other, my mom my dad my brother <laughter>, how they were a positive in my life, well they're always there for you you know whether you have financial problems they're there they help you out, whether you're sad they know you know and they'd be like hey what's wrong you know let's go out and eat somewhere just to cheer you up they're they're your family and they're always there to motivate you and, keep you going, <sigh>, uh easy, actually yeah pretty easy, i'm sorry, um, i haven't noticed but maybe, probably the same you know i don't think sleep does affect you but, i don't know maybe, more tired but i don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that, good, everything's great, um, maybe that i wanna start <s> know like start a new business or something, <clears throat> well like my dad um, he wasn't around for a while but he just got back, and um he actually opened up a shop and he's getting a a a lot of customers, so i see that his business is growing so i'm probably gonna learn learn <lear> um learn mechanic like like i was saying earlier, at school, <clears throat>, i don't even know what it what is that, no, nope, <coughs>, <coughs> i'm sorry, um, yesterday <laughter> last night 'cause i got a new game <laughter>, <coughs>, that i'm funny, <laughter>, i uh, uh no, <coughs>, um, i don't think nothing everything's fine you know thank god everything's good right now, i don't think there's nothing to change like that, maybe a better job, well first of all i don't even have a job, so i guess to change i get a job, nah it's hard for someone to put me down like that, <clears throat>, could say probably that i'm responsible as well, at home, resting and then i call some friends over they usually do come over, barbecue whatever comes to mind you know just there in my house 'cause i have a nice backyard 'cause i just moved to this new house, so so far each yeah so each weekend right now we just, people come over family come over and we pretty pretty much just barbecue there just hang out, <clears throat>, my sister's birthday party, it was on saturday, and it was fun there was a lot of dancing you know people uh i saw, family that i haven't seen for a while, so i enjoyed doing that, so, <clears throat>, probably that i was like i was able to help my mom throughout, because she was going through a really hard time my mom and um, for almost nine years 'cause she was having hard trouble paying bills and rent, so i, i'm proud that i was able to help her even though i could only, give so little, but she at least we're all still good you know and we're still alive and everyone's still blessed and, um, being around my family music music always puts me in a good mood, any kinda music even if it's even if it's depressing music it's still gonna <go> it it's still gonna get me happy, yeah, <laughter>, mhm, no problem anytime, bye, mm am i supposed to press the button,

had great parents, uh , my mom uh my parents met at tuskegee, this is a black college and they always want me to go to a black college, but of course i didn't want to do that < laughter> uh i went to illinois so, they are a very positive example for me, there are certain things i don't do today because i don't drink, i don't curse, i don't look at people who do, but i don't have that much respect for people who do a lot of either one of these things., i love to drive i love to travel, and my dad always took us somewhere he was gone every weekend, we would go somewhere because we were in chicago indiana michigan somewhere in the area where we went to michigan and picked fruit or we all got our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana something like that, uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer, so my father used to drive and i also love to drive, mm, that's hard., i've had a lot of great experiences., uh, i think the best thing was that we went to europe on my wedding day, we went to paris and.., we drove the orient express, we did not go all the way to istanbul, we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris., this was probably the best experience i ever had in my life i never really cared for europe because it explained so much here in unity and so much in america and i was on alaska and hawaii, but we said we would do something else and, we always wanted to go to the orient express and we have this expensive but phenomenal journey, must do it once it is a once journey not even in life only once, do not travel faster than we have done much when the children were younger, but.., there are a lot of things we should have done, we shouldn't have done, i wish i'd gone to chicago <chica> we'd always go to chicago on thanksgiving, but i think we should have gone more than just thanksgiving, my parents are coming here for christmas, but i think we could have.., much more done when it comes to, yes, that's why it's a regret because it could have been avoided, there are things we could have done, and we spent our time working and more worried about moving forward than really family and what's closest to us, i think that people <peop> most people, oh, yeah, definitely., ooh , that's a good question ten or twenty years ago, i would have said.., do not take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed about them too, sometimes you can take things for granted, never take anything for granted, nothing is promised, oh, god, keep it!, <laughter> no i have not <laughter>, no , very very easy i really have no problem with that once in a while, if i uh am worried about something or have things coming due or projects due then i'll somehow uh worried a little, i don't like to be late, uh i don't like to make mistakes, so i have some fear issues that make me stay up all night just to do things to make sure i have everything right, tired, i'm not getting irritable i think i just uh, lethargic maybe a little bit <litt> just a little, very good i was up late last night, so i'm kind of tired now, but i don't normally have any trouble sleeping, uh, and i get a good night's sleep, mhm, no i didn't, um, no,

caring for someone else and starting to have a good life, i think that's rewarding., to ensure that everything is covered, that needs to be covered with you kids whether it's their food their sleeping clothes dress them, make sure they're satisfied make sure they don't have any problems at school or at home or uh that they're safe, physically mental spiritual everything, hmm, my best friend would

listening to me.",1
420,"mm, yes i am, um i'm okay, chicago, um back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit, haven't been out there in over fifteen sixteen years, um, kinda got stuck out here <laughter> then i had my baby and i just stayed, uh, different food um, the people get along way um how do i get it it's kind of a culture shock, uh, out there just on the food basis they like to give you a lotta food, that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they wanna go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lotta money so they just making money <laughter>, um, mm parent had business out here, um, not hard, i could get used to anywhere, the views and the ocean, uh, just uh, a splitting of people that's it <laughter>, um just a few places, getting to see different people and learn how different people get along and interact with each other, <laughter> um, uh, i remember a trip years ago where i went to mexico with my brother, yeah, um, jumping into a lake <laughter> pretty much off the side of a mountain <laughter>, yeah, everything, there's not a subject i don't like, um, actually my dream job, working with computers and helping people, that's, where <wh> where my heart is i like computers and i also like helping people, i meditate um work out, i run i walk, um, i write read, in the median, mm, i'd say very good, oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good <laughter> um last time i argued, was, over someone actually spitting out a racial slur, towards my um wife, angry, upset hurt, disrespected, and especially when i went up there to treat the person actually i was treating 'em with dignity and respect and trying to help the person at first, it's no problem people are people, mm, i had a chance in school to really go a lot further than i did, and i let something very small, and meaningless stop me in the pursuit of it, um, ignorance, <laughter> for lack of a better word, now that i think back on it i could've done a whole lot to avoid it but i was just young and foolish, to start living again, um, as much pain as i've seen in the world, um, a compilation of all the events uh just different bad things that i've seen, i, if i could change it i would but, sometimes, i guess things are there for a reason, even though we may not understand it, um, i have no answer to that, um, blood family we really don't talk um, my wife, don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not, she thinks that i'm doing everything in the world but that i'm not, and really <laughter>, i don't understand, i know my daughter loves me but i don't know if she wants to be with me or not, because, when somebody talks to you, when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in they voice and the belief in their eyes, if you say something so many times it's what really lies in your heart, <sharp inhale> so you could say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there, hmm i love my daughter, she a angel i cut her umbilical cord, i went out there and <laughter> put on her first shirt, i seen her come out, she looked at me right out the stomach <laughter> she wouldn't she was fighting with the doctors wouldn't let 'em touch her a bit, i talked to her i told her to calm down or i told her it was daddy she looked up at me grabbed my fingers and like just calmed down and just let 'em do everything they needed to do, no it's constantly changing task um, what you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that it's constantly um, what is a better word for it um, <laughter> um, adjusting, um, the hardest thing i'll probably say, is, scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for 'em not learn the wrong lessons, <laughter> seeing your baby smile in appreciation, i try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees, um, when i was younger there were a lotta things that i seen that no child or adult should've seen, and um, when <whe>, i grew up, i swore to myself that i'll always take care of my child and, i wouldn't disappear or, let her be around things like that, um, my old foster parents, mm, they basically showed me no matter where you come from, you can always strive to get better, um, a good night's sleep, eh um it comes, the same just tired and yawning <laughter>, how have i been feeling, mm, like, i have a wealth of queries and, a wealth of gold, within my, grasp and it's just right out of my reach because i just need that one, connector to really just, see what i'm capable of and i know i'm capable of a lot it's just, i need to make that connection, no, um, mm not p_t_s_d no, uh, i said yes but, i don't figure i'm any more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking points, my daughter's birthday on the twenty sixth, um took her out to chuck e cheese she had fun she played games she was on bikes <deep breath> she was crawling through puzzle games um, man this girl did about everything <laughter>, um, fun loyal caring, um, something to change, i would like to be more accurate, not getting to know who my mom was, stop thinking about whatever else has happened and just do what you need to do, i'm positive i'm goal-oriented, determined, um, i'm very imaginative very creative, <laughter> ideal, i would probably, be doing a little bit of everything, rock climbing biking, hiking going with my daughter places um, <laughter> man, i'll probably be skiing snowboarding and everything <laughter> in a ideal weekend, my daughter, no problem, goodbye",3
343,"yes, i'm okay, uh los angeles california, yes, i like the weather, um, basically i like the people, different uh things to do out here, mm, i'm not really sure, that get excuse me, , um i would have to say, someone being rude or uh, someone bullying or, just somebody that has a negative attitude, when i'm annoyed, it all depends, hmm, i might make have a comment or something like that or uh, i might just absorb it or something, you know just think about it, it all depends on the situation, no, uh i don't, i think i had a disagreement i don't know when the last time i've been in some argument i really don't it's been a long time, it was just basically a disagreement but i i haven't argued with anyone <an> someone in quite some time i can't even recall, uh it was a family matter, and my brother had a disagreement with, with one of our other brothers and you know he was upset about that in return i got a little upset because, you know, what you mean, <laughter> what you mean how hard is what, so excuse me for <laughter> excuse me for laughing, now oh so could you go over that again, what was the question, okay, listen to music, somewhat, i don't know why i guess you know, that's how it is a a little bit i do, why did you ask <a> why did you ask me that, huh, basic uh, things english math but why'd you ask me that question though, uh i'm um trying to find employment, right, just a job that i enjoy going to, i don't really have a dream job, no, uh when my kid children was small playing with 'em, that's the last time i was really that i recall, it's not easy, hmm, trying to give some guidance or some advice that they'll listen to, being a parent, you know you just connected to someone you know it's family, someone that you love and, someone that loves you, isn't much to tell, <sigh>, i mean i have children just you know, well not children i have one child, and two uh, sons that's older they're adults, i think i'm kinda close with them, what do i what, what you mean what do i think of today's kids what do you mean by that, <sigh> i think they're more uh, i don't think they're as respectful as, they were when i was a when i was young when i was a kid i think they got more disrespectful, no, no, before i uh, uh maybe <may> about six months ago or something like that, just the way i was feeling, you know i just wasn't feeling good i was feeling sad you know and, wasn't sleeping good and, you know just wasn't feeling right, i had a problem with the way i was feeling, that was the whole purpose of me going to seek some kinda help, feel alright, have i ever did what, no, right now, no, oh i don't sleep that good, i don't know why, if i had an answer if i had an answer i would sleep better, um i don't know, no, i never, i never been to therapy, i don't have a best friend, i have a, a couple, i think i have some good qualities i think i'm basically a good person, uh the company of uh, my associates, that usually do, just hanging out with uh a friend, we were just hanging out laughing talking drinking beer, yeah, i felt alright, no, i should've completed college, i said i should have, i got many of 'em, hmm, well i have a lot of 'em, um <sigh> getting up this morning that was memorable, 'cause it was a new day, and thankful, to be <b> to be living today, mhm, <sigh> man, uh i would say, being a father, just being a father you know, and uh, that is a a memorable <mem> that's a good experience, excuse <scuse> me, uh i don't i can't um <sigh> i had a couple of 'em i guess uh some people that i associated with, probably that's the most uh one i can think of, thank you, alright, bye",9
376,"yes, i'm doing okay it's still morning so, i'm from the east coast massachusetts, yes, um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter>, um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas, um, l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry, and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a, in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street, so the, yeah, um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school, but uh, after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses, um, well i love the beach, and i love the mountains i like to go hiking, um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy, no, not at all, um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger, went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately, um overseas, um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit, but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out, oh that's alright, gah, um, i don't have one, to be honest um, i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter>, so, um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment, um as to if we wanna, continue communicating with the person or not, and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot, so, yes, um, i like watching movies, i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book, um not good at times i uh i have a, some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get, uh yesterday, and it was with my partner, and um, actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just, sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself, so, um, at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind, um i do not, purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature, but, i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged, so, um, uh last year my mother died, so, i wish i handled that differently, um, it upsets <ups> it's upsets me, so, it's okay, um let me see, uh <sigh>, i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter>, that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired, but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because, it's like i can't uh, i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep, um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind, uh you know thinking about bills and, and, the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it, uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode, it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating, everything so, i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter>, i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee, yeah, so other than that, i'm, i'm okay, um well i've been i've been depressed, for quite some time, and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty, uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died, so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to, get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do, that i haven't done in a year because of what happened, um i just, i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat, um, i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep, so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day, yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis, oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably, ten to fifteen years ago, and it's just something i've never, gotten over i don't know whether or not, you can so i've always taken the medicine, um, i was, arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i, was feeling desperate and hopeless, and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized, and then uh, they started treating me i started seeing a therapist, so, um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist, but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some, avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me, i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there, and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this, and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback, as to how to deal with the emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions, so, um, like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication, um, there's been no changes really, i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver, and uh, even though a lot of times i, feeled i felt overwhelmed or, lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her, uh, i still was a heck of a lot happier, than i am now, so, um, uh <sigh>, i would say when my son was born years ago, i'm not a parent anymore he passed away, so, um, and that was difficult as well, uh, hmm, um i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me, because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained, and um, you know those qualities are are admirable in people that can keep their word and and be responsible, excuse me, oh i have lots of regrets um, uh things that i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about, but um you know i met somebody once in my life, that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker, uh, live to never regret, so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation, but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done, um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really, give my friends any kind of advice i mean, i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother, um, i just state my opinion that's all, um well right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating, after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive, i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot, you know sleep eat sleep eat, and so now i'm kinda like on a diet trying to lose this weight 'cause it's very unhealthy for me, um, hmm, trying to think it's been a long time, actually there's really nothing because, now i just keep my mind busy, i haven't been to a movie in ages i don't i used to go out shopping all the time i don't now, um, so it's been it uh it's been quite some time since,

411,"safe, pretty good, new york, i moved to ia in the seventies., but i did, but i lived a lot of different places, of, um, i guess every few years, but, i travel a lot, so i lived in, i lived in africa, i also lived in spain switzerland hong kong., around different cultures food music rituals, uh, everything that smells the colors, makes you feel alive, excuse me., one of my travels, uh i lived in kenya for about a year around i'd say, i love riding like this when you are, uh other animals see when you are, type of disguised in the scent of a horse you can get the animals much closer so around it was great, see red orange autumn sunsets and, ride along, you know uh, so many animals see yeah, in kenya, probably when i went to a, a masai village and i happened to live in hawaii, and i was on tahiti, and i was wearing one of those pareos, which are handpainted, and i had it, tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to, entering a masai village for the first time, uh that day and i looked around everywhere and the men wore their clothes exactly the same, turn <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came to me and they said why are you masai dressed, and uh <laughter> and around then they came back and gave me what seemed to be, uh, some very large, which looked like pearl leather bookmarks, but they were actually earrings, so they weighed like, my ears straight down and then they gave me some bracelets, and then they uh i had to wear something around my waist and they said now you really see masai <laughter> so but i just i have a lot of uh i think live, get a chance to live in different countries around the world i just got uh you feel alive all your senses are totally you know uh awakened yes, i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of people are a hybrid of both i mean, i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely bold, uh and very brave at other times probably one of my best virtues is that i'm very good natured person, so if i really feel passionate about something, i risk everything to go, sometimes to reach i think that, um, usually i do well i make decisions very quickly, and i think i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he told me how to make decisions faster, and i told him i said well in any case, you always have no choice and he says what you mean there is, hundreds of decisions and i didn't really say, because it's belly wise just one, and it's not really important you waste time physical energy emotional energy, mental energy reflects everything if well wise you always know what the choice is, what you really want to do, and it doesn't matter if there is a ninety eight percent probability of failure, even if it's a two percent chance of success, you have to go to the one that can give you joy, so i always go to the one that it's a waste of total time for me., and energy to even think about another choice, because who cares if you stay unharmed, but it if it does not bring joy, uh, excuse me., you said you'd put your fish, what do i do if i'm angry?, to <sigh>, <tisk> i think if i'm upset sometimes it's me, because sometimes i can have, i can have a little more patience around, i guess you really have to sit down for yourself, in the shoes of another rather than the way you would react, you must have more empathy, i don't think that's why i'm so happy to travel because you, in other situations where you are forced to, to the, understanding other people, lives much more, regardless of how different they are, uh from your different situations i've been in so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that it helps you to create what's why, traveling is really the best education there is, let me think., last time i argued about it, a little, uh.., god, i'm trying to remember <laughter> around, oh, i think it was when someone didn't respect my privacy in something, um, uh.., oh, i know what it was., it was someone who belonged to the uh, uh scientology faith around, i don't know., inherited, i may have inherited an immune disorder from my mother, my mother died of lupus., and, uh i sometimes even at the moment i have rashes and everything and i'm very photosensitive, and, i had a you know an episode where i was i had big torches and i didn't feel really good i felt red and everything and the scientologist tells me that i had to be audited, and, and he said something about are you aware, past lives and, i had told him that i was a buddhist and i was kind of curious that, if you are trying to recruit someone to at least convert to your religion, you should find out the other person which religion they are to be even informed and able to talk to them, and i and he said that you know that, um, <tisk> about something in your past and i'm going to think that, many religions uh including buddhists and scientology believe that things you have have <ha>, had in your story sometimes affect you or things you keep that anger asking bitterness, through your previous relationships or your, parents and such can influence and even make you sick you even have cancer, yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe that i said that, you know that you have the power of each person to go a god like or a buddha like nature and you can make yourself, even if i'm close to being maybe, i'm probably getting a cold., maybe every fifteen years i have no tendency to be sick at all, and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on edge, i'll take, like i did, even when i was a child when i was seven, i would., folding i had my boo boo, and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part, you know, help the bad part <laughter> out of a simplistic way in relation to a child, and i would actually, even when i was in a very serious car accident where i was cut by glass my whole back, i concentrated healing and when i went back to the hospital, the doctors actually had the nurses coming and say this is incredible that, only <jj> she last week her back was cut so hard this is incredibly healing thing, so i think that but uh, um, uh, but i was just, i think, upset and irritated a little, because the scientologist told me that, because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he had these certificates on his wall that he felt that he had more enlightened and, it wasn't even one thing i said if it was him., whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i practised buddhism, whether it was for five ten fifteen, twenty years or if someone has been practicing a kind of christianity for fifty years and is sitting in a church every day, does not mean that this person would have, never visited the church and more spiritually than someone who has, you know, so i just thought this was the antithesis of, someone who says they're enlightened, but it's just the way i think he's getting his, uh, you know his belief in my neck that after a while i was pretty patient with him, but he was so pompous that i was irritated, especially when he kept telling me that it was being audited and that the same person needed a hip surgery, the following week, and i didn't show him because i didn't want to., into it, but, you could say hey you have a bad hip because you need to be tested that something you've done in your past, otherwise you wouldn't need to have a hip surgery i mean, i think to some extent things that can be caused, from the people themselves, and then he says flippy good, you're aware scientologists believe that, past life can also be based on, you know, and i think of myself, buddhists of all religions are, are somehow as well known for you know, believe in a cause and effect and past life situations and i found my thoughts, he should really read when he tries to convert other people < laughter> from other religions so, but.., you know, i know it just wasn't me., you know he cares about the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>, but unlike that, i don't mean, <sigh> um, uh.., sometimes having a little more beat, i guess when, when it is in relation to patience, i can figure this out right away, i guess i'll cut my father off when he was like a vegetable in the hospital., mm < sigh>, mm my brother, uh should be the strong one supposedly because he, is in the medical field so my sister and i said good, you know he's the doctor, so he's probably used to seeing this all the time., but it turned out that he was the weakest and also after, you know my boss, my father,, you know., you know it would make his body crooked., fighting the artificial breathing device and all kinds of things you see, all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was very difficult, but you know it was after a while the uh, you even know the doctors and even the uh pastor of this particular, uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he wouldn't be like any more, even if he'd wake up from that he'd be his brain function, you know, negligible, yeah, it was mhm., hm, mm, i don't think i really have so many things that are so traumatic., that happened to me that i, had to block it i really don't know what, it's in my makeup,, doesn't make me feel like i don't have to hold like i do i have friends who, have unchecked problems they don't even know, who influence their behavior or perhaps their bitterness or anger or hatred or fear, and for some reason i feel blessed that i, i can't even think of something that, i mean, i had something, bad situations happen to me, but, it's not why they traumatized me., influence, you know my behavior where i would, where i block it, that i am not aware, of something or i think rest, negativity for some reason, i can't think of anything i mean., there are bad things that happen and i know they're there, but it's not like i have the feeling that it's necessary for me,, to block them because i was able to, you know., sometimes accept <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that have happened, pretty easy i can usually sleep my own myself in any situation if i could take a one hour flight to san francisco i could only, kind of lean on the window with the pillow have the ceiling over and even on an hour flight out before the plane has even taken out of the ground so, i can just <j>i literally have when i have had little sleep and i have very uh high energy so i don't really need so much sleep, but, like i'm in africa and i'm in africa, <tisk> bumpy pothole unpaved street and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i just requir put up something my, elbows against the window and say, i think i'm going to take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes so and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have this problem, okay pretty okay i mean, i could flare up without the skin, but you know, from the photo sensitivity and all that, but unlike that, i'm in pretty good spirts uhh, have i ever investigated < s> what, i still couldn't hear you, i'm sorry., have i ever studied changes in my behavior, what was the word, yes, um, uh, um, uh.., around <sigh> i don't just know with friends and all this, last week just seeing friends i enjoy being with and just laughing at a great meal just you know a good time listening to music, repent my whole life you mean, or you're just talking about it, or what you're talking about, mm, you know it's funny., uh i find that a lot of negative experiences that have happened in my life, too, have been, uh, um, opened up experiences that, they're also great that i'm not, for example, i was totally torn down by my business partner, after the melody of all my <wh> all my savings and i had to start over and, sometimes people sat with me like, if you're sure you're okay, you're just pretending to be okay, or, if you're angry, if i was, you want to seek revenge, you know, because my business partner basically ripped me off, we knew each other's families that even, more difficult in a way around and uh, he basically stole my whole life savings essentially in a way and he was sent to jail and the f b i involved was interpol involved, i lived in switzerland and my father was sick and i went back and forth and around, but you know, if i hadn't sneaked in, i wouldn't have gotten involved with him., i would not have had the many rich experiences and i sometimes think the reason why, i don't know why i'm such a positive person, but for some reason i'm able, it's not that i'm deliberately trying to see, the positivity in even terrible situations that i would not have gotten, to live in barcelona and i would not have learned to speak spanish so well <g>, german, uh lived in europe if i didn't participate in business with my business partner who ended up tearing me apart, but and there are many other experiences and different friendships that i develop, during this time and in some way it was a completely different life, uh, another world that, that you know that i never, um had the chance, you know,, live through if i don't have my, you know, but of course it cost me money and then again i was always the kind of person who, money is not everything and, i think when i'm least interested in money, when i made the best of it so, there you go., <laughter> and, for example, one of my favorite, times in my life probably when i lived in kenya, and you'd think that, you know a lot of people have that., really bad vision of it maybe look alive, in mud dung huts or something and live very primitive i mean it's not that at all, but me and you would think that with the least amount of, uh technological <tech> technological innovations and things like that i actually mean and i really didn't have, they know that a lot of many material goods at the time i mean, i had the explosion i probably had the one of the best, years of my life when i lived in kenya, the same thing i probably did when i was about fifteen or sixteen, um, to, live your life with passion, and again how to choose the way i said earlier about, making decisions, you must make these decisions wisely, what will, give you a sense of reverence and wonder that would make you happy, and you need it regardless of what the percentages are, even if you have only one percent chance of success, you have to go into this because that's the only thing that will deliver, you know happiness in your life, <tisk> the fact that i stuck to it and was brazen, whatever you want to say, the balls have the chutzpah the cojones to go and, follow my, passions and, you know, and i guess people sometimes call them strong choices, usually, decisions that are simple <ea> if you don't normally give pleasure where you remain unharmed, that's just murphy's law, that's exactly the way it is, safe, see you.",0

anything., oh, i like the beach, i love all the restaurants, um, around the music scene just the general excitement oh and the parks and all that, yeah, that's good., to transport, the, maintenance on the streets all pot holes, um, um, pollution, i studied a number of things at school., i've been studying to, to at one point i was in public relations journalism specialization in journalism, and i also studied around i was a pre law major, and so, i have studied the law and then i have also studied to, um, man.., human services courses, mhm, mainly because i'm a human being, and i enjoy helping

my ankle because i had anaemia <anenia> and, and i got dizzy one night and fell on my ankle and on my leg and so i'm just waiting for this to really heal, but i plan to come back to tennis, it's one of the things i enjoy doing, really relaxes me, i really have no temperament over the years, i've learned how to control it., probably it would have been yesterday, but there was no argument., and what it was about, nothing i can remember <laughter>, something i feel guilty about, hm, there's nothing i feel guilty about right now., mm, oh, a situation i wish i'd treated differently, i really can't imagine anyone right now., the toughest decision oh, um, the absolutely toughest decision i've ever had to make, um, was when my uh i twins boys they've grown now, i had twins, twin teen, and i had lost my job and we lived in a motel, and, the rent for the motel was outrageous i couldn't pay any more the, in order to pay for the kind of money they wanted, i had to pay for it., um, put my son under the nursing ward for a minute., that was the hardest decision i had to make, , around a schizophrenic, and he had, he was born with an auditory processing deficit, which he overcame by training with a speech therapist and school official, and he also lost his hearing when he was four years old., um, but.., and then, when he became fourteen, schizophrenia came, so he's in a supportive environment right now, where he's twenty seven years old., but he's settled with his mental illness and now he accepts it., i had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication you'd give him, and he hid it, put it in his pocket or whatever., well, but he got along with it, and we all got along with it, and he's doing him pretty good., , the son is twenty, he's seven, as i said, because he's a twin., um, um lived in texas with his wife, and he got a promotion to.., , now he's in california, both of them in california., um, i feel very good about the yeah, uh, hm, good from adult children yes, <laughter> of adult children yes, no, i'll take that back., not it's not hard to be a parent of adults of my adult children okay when they were younger, there were difficult times okay difficult periods and around, it was also a lot of good times, but yes, there were some difficult times., mm, well, the mm the difficult times that i've really been alluding to a lot and that was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and, and, they were in, temporary and, in the good one was in the care and one was actually in an institution because of the about the schizophrenia, um, so, think i've lost track of the question <laughter>, the hardest part about being a parent, at this point at this point in my life, there's nothing serious about it., um, the best thing about being a parent, i don't know, i guess it's just to see <cough>, something you created to develop into a pretty decent person you know, a decent person., that's the best., oh, many ways, well, actually., i didn't have two parents, i had a mother., and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him around, but the thing i do, unlike what my mother did, um, she was a strong disciplinary, both oral and physical, um, and, she at her had this tendency that she grew out of, she had this tendency to be very critical, okay critical and.., to oppose <laughter> and very religious, um, and somehow, i looked at people who weren't, and that was me as if they were, were life wrong because they did not go to church or read the bible and this kind of thing, what was the other part, on the question, i don't sleep well or i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is if i don't take medication, i don't sleep, i'll be awake all night i'll be awake, i'll be up for days if i don't take medication., man irritable around, and tired <laughter>, all right., lately, you know, just a little scared really around, you know, i just.., made a move to a new apartment it is a lot of cost and, new issues and things like that you know and new furniture and new this and that that you have to do all this, but, the whole thing was kind of stressful., yes mhm, no p t s d, yes, um, that was back in i think two thousand and four, um, because my life had become so stressful, up to the point where , it was either i had to do something or, or stop something to tell you the truth yeah, um, yeah,, yes, i think it's useful to you to know as a good sounding record, you know someone to throw, you know, your concerns and you know, discuss things that bother you or good things to yes, i think therapy with medications, um, since i went to therapy, in order to make the changes, a lot of changes to, i was more focused., more, hopeful, um, hm, it was just a good experience for me, which is why i keep going, really happy, all right., i can feel really happy, i can't think of anything about an incident right now, just like that., and then, i go back to what i felt, so i really can't determine exactly what i mean., anyway i mean, if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right, unlike things that go wrong all the time, that it makes me happy if things go right, how about, hm, mm something i've done recently, that i really, something i did recently that i really enjoyed, my really really enjoyed, recently, hm, i can't think of anything., i don't have a best friend., to my best qualities, are that , i'm an honest person., i really give people the benefit of doubt, to all in my book, is what they seem to be, until they prove it's different, um, i'm very generous., too generous <laughter>, um, and i'm very fond of helping other people, i mean, help me that i'm on a personal level to help people., you know what their problem is, i enjoy doing something for someone else that helps them,, mhm, everything i regret, how is that possible?, there's only one thing i regret and that's that, um, after my twins became old enough to, start to the school of primary school level around, i took a few courses as a pre law major., and, at that time i was married to her father, who has proved not to be good, fit for me, and, because of the burdens associated with him, you know this would end and i'd leave him., um, i left college., so that was my greatest regret, hm, stay in school, no matter what, stay the course, no matter what, that i'm a good person, i'm a good person, that's all., all right., goodbye.",10

computer that i like to play for a little while and then, um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax that's what we do and you know, 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so, i like to watch crime dramas, um, really mad probably not a lot um, i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room, almost ever, so that that gets me angry but um, in terms of like really um, getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like, little things that my children do to you know, especially my oldest child who's twenty one, you know he can be confrontational so, other than that nothing gets me like really angry, haven't i haven't haven't felt that, um contributing to society helping uh, helping, to raise um responsible people i guess um, and of course the love and the affection and the um, the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go, i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children, are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults, so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and, all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh, challenging discussions and that sort of thing, so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and, you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff, the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven, um, you're never not a parent, you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first, with my first child um, thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot, um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but, i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and, um, it it it uh, in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom, mhm, always, i'm sorry, i didn't get what you said, um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church, um and my faith, uh but also my husband he's been a really um, he's kind of he's very, like logical thinking and very you know grounded, so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always, we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out, it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life, um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper, um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like, rarely do i have outbursts um, i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up, so with you know like my husband and i don't, rarely fight like have, arguments that are, yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens, because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something, i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up, um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he, um, you know he thinks he knows everything, he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality , and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and, you know as life goes on he'll learn more, he's very confident and very self uh, self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct, and, he still has a lot of learning to do that's all, mhm, it is it can be mhm, i think um, that many of them are um, spoiled and live in an environment of uh, of instant gratification, um, which i think is gonna be, um detrimental to the to the future of this country, but um, you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i, i have um hope that um, they will, i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics, and uh, hopefully our our the next generation and the, the generations after that, can maintain that um, that standard of living i don't know if it's possible, mm as, loving nurturing um, funny, we laugh a lot and um, caring honest, things that uh, i mean my best i have , well actually my best friend is, it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um, we, i, for some years, took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close, have a very close relationship with them still do, and so um i'm considered the fourth sister, so i would say that those are my best friends and and um, we love each other very much, it's a good relationship, no, no, yes, most, mostly, mm minorly depression it was more anxiety, um probably um, um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally, like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but, um, other than that i i you know so, depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control, um but now it's under control so, i have a great, huh, um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic, um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance , in my brain, i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um, we had a , good family gatherings, a little stressed because um, we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um, and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of, some renovation and some, to help and some obviously moving around, and so we're in the throws of that and um, so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because, really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties, so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them, um, not easy usually, all of my life i think i've always, i mean i'm not i've always had um, at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night, um, to go to the bathroom basically, and uh, other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning, then i can't go back to sleep i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then, go back to bed and, go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are, have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors, yeah sometimes it does, mm, probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know, but um, i think overall probably the same, my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful, they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know, they may pitch in a little bit more, uh not really, not not no, not really, not anything significant, huh, um actually yes i do, i do feel like therapy is useful, um well uh we had a situation with my daughter, um, she also suffers from anxiety and, um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish, a group with her that was a six month um, uh, group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a , it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers, and um, it's been really good it's been, very helpful it's just all about, how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental, um strategies to keep your uh keep you from, your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know, in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so, um, that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter, and it's been really um, really informational and really helpful i think, oh my daughter was um she was, in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and, we knew it and um, we acted on it that's all, um, like, really joyful and happy i would say probably, when, probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan, uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful, um and it was it happened that our anniversary was, we left on our anniversary day flew to israel, so it was right at the same time, it was beautiful, very meaningful, and other than that i would say you know like, uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and, you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three, on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so, um, um that's an interesting question i would say, um, once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm, have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or, errands to run once i get them done, i feel like a sense of accomplishment, you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um, you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things, you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know, so i think that would be you know for me the most um, most recent, um, way of feeling good and feeling you know, like feeling accomplished, dream job hm, i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula, and um, yeah and um, so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends, and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in, the birth the bringing of new life into this world so, i would say that's probably, was my was a dream job and i didn't know it, i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um, was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore, actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed, but um, i like i said i do it for family members, um, i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident, she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children, and um, i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends, and, her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave, i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth, which is a whole different experience, so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery, but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you, even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like, so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood, um about fifteen years ago, 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old, so um, yeah, and i've been, um, well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but, uh and you know also like, for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business, and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me, so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the, um, the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby, i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter] , it was in the middle of the night she was like , two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter], so um, it went really fast but other than that, you know um, yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do, um, in all of life or in your job, uh probably my my own birth, i mean my the birth of my own children, um, like there's an extreme, sense of joy excitement relief, because of course you're out of the pain, and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know, going forward from there but it's, it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome, after you give birth, and i have experienced both ways i've done both um, natural and, my last child was via c_section so i've had both, both um experiences, um, i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little, psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny, and um she, she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was, born very quickly after he broke the water and oof, my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble, because i only had like two contractions after that, my daughter was born in the bed, so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but, um i'm sure they weren't happy, to fill out a lot of paper work after that, so, now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago, um, ten or twenty years ago i was probably more, not as um, relaxed not as um, like i feel now at my age that um, i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about, uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what, you know, you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care, you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever, so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that, you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things, what are you most proud of in your life, most proud of um, probably my family my my husband and my, my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've, we're an in tact family that, um, my kids see every day how, their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and, they um, they actually express, gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family, so i would say that's probably it, um, probably the, one of my best qualities is, uh, being able to listen to people and being able to um, not be judgmental um, through the years i've had a , a lot of experience with um, people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and, it's just taught me that um, everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems, and um i don't think i'm better than someone else, if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough, okay, okay, goodbye",1
488,", yes, beautiful, oh san fernando tal, i like the culture i love to go to museums and go at night and have lots of people., it's a lot spread out and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive anywhere and not over a good public transport system, uh not really i like to go camping, but i don't really travel, i think i was on a geology class six months ago., yeah, it was fun., hmm <sigh>, i think it's hard to say, well, i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to the death valley, and i have a lot of really cool things to see and hang out with my friends at night, philosophy, yes, um, hmm, i don't know, i think it just happened that i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of got disappointed and i liked, all the different, ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy, what are you doing?, i don't know, but i really like kids and i like, to study your behavior, so i think something along these lines could be, i think i'm usually pretty outgoing i tend to be shy about my family, but if i'm close to friends and stuff i, i think i'm pretty friendly, many times i will watch or read t v, um, yeah, that's good., i think i'm pretty good i'm not getting really angry i'm trying to think about it, other things when i start to get crazy or.., i'm just trying to focus on my breathing, i think the last time i had a fight with someone, it was probably with my boyfriend., but i'm having trouble remembering what was the last thing we were arguing about., i think it was <wa> i didn't feel very good and i had difficulty deciding if i wanted to go to his department at the end of the year party, and he got frustrated, which i thought was very reckless, because i didn't feel well to start with, i had the feeling that he didn't really consider my feelings and, i, really hate when he gets stressed or gets slightly angry because i see that as unnecessary and it emphasizes me out, hmm, i think many times when my, oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother, uh does something wrong i tend too hard with him uh we're not so close, as my sister and me or my youngest brother and me, and so he tends to be hostile back, and i think if i was a little gentler, it might be easier to communicate with him., hmm, um, when i was nineteen, i came home., by a party, i think at four o'clock in the morning on a sunday morning and my father got really angry at me and yelled at me saying a lot of not very nice things, and then he didn't talk to me for a year, well, my relationship with my mother is much better now that i don't live at home., i was very frustrated with her all the time because she has a very fast temperament, but i think now that i have a little more distance, i can see that she did the best she could, to <sigh>, and i love my siblings i, again my little sister and i really get along well she's, four years younger than me, and when, when she was at twelve and i was at sixteen, it was really difficult because she had a really hard temper and she was always moody and, it wasn't me., in a place to be patient with this kind of stuff, so we fought all the time, but we no longer, and that's really great, and, we get along well with my uh, my older little brother, who is fifteen and i think i'm getting pretty good with my youngest brother, who is twelve, , one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved their classes and it was really good, uh in a class with a professor who really cared and, who really hired people who were really motivating, as not all my classes were so, i think it's pretty easy, i mean sometimes i have trouble sleeping, but, usually it's not that bad, i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning., um, well, i'm really tired i can get grumpy, but i think i'm usually just, groggy, pretty good, i'm a little worried about, um, about getting a job and i'm going to summer school over, it's just a class, so i have a lot of free time., um, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., i mean, it's not the end of the world when i don't get a job, but i know that after all, i usually think i just don't try to think too much about it and i don't try to be pessimistic, no, no, hmm, well, i think the last time i felt really happy i, went to a party with my friend at the end of the department party, and, i was the one you know i knew some people there, so i felt comfortable, but i was also able to meet new people, and there were a few kids there squirting around in the pool and i had some drinks and ate something to eat and it was fun, she would probably say that, i'm smart and uh, quite intellectually i love to read and see, really like serious movies and t v, um, and she would probably also say that i'm fun because we like to go out and have a lot of fun, well, i'm kind of, um, i can really be disorganized, and that sometimes gets me into trouble like that., so that's a great one, the and procrastination, hmm, i had a bit of trouble a few months ago and had to go to court and was uh, if you use , eh, sixty hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing so, so i had to show in court again to get an extension and the judge was, very mean and he didn't seem i mean he screamed me, but it didn't seem, as he thought it seemed like it was just some kind of supply, talk he gave to everyone he thought needed, so i understand that, because that's his job., but it was, has not been taking place, great for me because i wasn't i was really scared in this situation, well, i would have been twelve., and two, um, but i think, i think i would have told myself when i was 12, not being so hard on myself and not being so hard on my parents because i think, i was a little selfish and self involved back then, i can't think of anything, i regret how i treated my mother when i was a child, but everyone does that and, um, i regret it., a few of, before semesters i didn't get so good at school and i got a, a few ws i have to work now to get on my transcript, i think i'm, i think i'm.., i didn't concentrate at school at the time., and i haven't seen any counselors at school or anything so i could definitely have done that, i think i'd spend my ideal weekend on saturday and then, walking or maybe just going to the duck pond at my house, feeding ducks and picking oranges, and then maybe, go shopping for breakfast sunday and just like windows, and maybe a little t v, what are you doing?, my youngest brother is autistic and my mother and father always worked when he grew up., i'm ten years older than him., and as the oldest i always took care of him,, made me really patient because he was a handful, but i'm really proud of how he developed and, and how close we are",0

amazing, it's remarkable, the first time i was in new york, i was about 11 years old., and i made sure that i got the window seat in the plane and only the feeling of taking off is just intoxicating, but uh, we're gone., around <tisk> at night here in l a and it was the next day in new york, so it was kind of confusing to get used to the change of time, the first thing i remember was getting a piece of new york pizza., it was delicious <laughter>, yep <laughter>, , degree with a bachelor's degree in communication, so i can go to the military as an officer, actually, it's like what, i don't

is, but you can be paid to do nothing <laughter>, yeah, that's good., but.., likely, i was definitely shy when i was a kid, but i grew up with the experience of college, so i'm much more open, uh i write music and i usually work like this when i feel stressed, i just make a number of push ups and raise some weights, i'm pretty good at, i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year, and i don't know, it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do, decide how only bottles leave my emotions in place in their corresponding outlets, not really, it was rather an interpersonal thing that, i don't know., probably yesterday something related to sports the playoffs are on things like that nature, to <sigh>, hm < sigh>, so many.., i guess in my senior year of high school i waited until the last minute to apply for u c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't turn into applications and i'm pretty sure i would have been admitted, so it sucks, but, hey, this is a fascinating question <sigh>um, i don't really know., the death of my grandmother, safe, um, my grandmother died when i was 11 years old, she drew me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me, she raised my sister, my brother, and my cousin., and her five children, so she was the matriarch of our family, and <sigh> the next thing i had to get a mother, and it was hard, but, it will take seven years for the next to come to the thirtieth., and i've grown a little bit no more tears, i'm a foster child, so i was emancipated by the nursing program about two years ago., but around my immediate family i'm pretty close to them, and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome, i've known them since i was five, so it was pretty cool, pretty easy i fall asleep pretty fast, it's no problem unless my back hurts you know, then it's a problem, mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i think i drive more aggressive <laughter>, uh a little stressed about a few problems i can take over, but i shouldn't stress because i can either do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work, um, sure, um, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, i have a few parking tickets, no parking tickets they don't move injuries, but they're tickets, and i didn't realize if you'd miss the courthouse without being in the hospital or being in prison., that you could not be excused not to make your court appointment, so i had, three no shows in court that sucked, tickets that are thousands of dollars and i don't have any money like that, i don't know., it's pretty hard to deal with when you're trying to make something of your life, but, there are so many barriers and obstacles that like you have not forgotten, so i don't know that it is sometimes stressful and, yeah, that's good., think about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my mind and i don't really communicate, to everyone because there's nothing anyone can really do for me, so i just fill it up like i do, all, not very after doing it for so long it will be a natural thing i think, no, no, hm really happy oh, why is that such a difficult question?, i don't know, i'm pretty satisfied with everything i don't know about extreme happiness right now, every day is exactly the same day, looks like it's.., uh dunking, on the other side of the clippers center there is a basketball court there, and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah, mm i have, four close friends i've known for over eight years, and i don't know, studious work hard, determined, i don't know., <laughter> yeah <laughter>, mm probably my metabolism, which i don't really have control over, uh i don't know, i'm pretty satisfied with myself, hmm <sigh>, i think in my sixth year of uh, uh primary school, i wasn't the best student, but.., i had a teacher who was diligent and how he let me down throughout the year, but i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards, so it was like a situation that i overcome after i felt so bad, and bottom, uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad because if it wasn't for his stars, i don't think i had, to be the discipline where i'm now in college and so that he was pretty influential., uh, i remember this time i was in the desert or uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his father, and we are actually stuck in the mountains and as if we had gone down a gorge, and then his jeep did not come upon a rock, so it was beautiful, yeah, it was around <tisk> it was kind of weird i thought i was superman i was trying to move a skirt, that was thousands of pounds that didn't work., but yes we finally came out we thought we were stuck in the desert, but it was a fun time to drive in the desert, if i didn't have my license, so it was fun yeah, about this day or in general, mm, unlike the u c

little bit it's a laid back appearing town but it's actually very um uh sensitive to you know, uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing, so you have to keep up the pace, uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment, and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you you do in others, oh be an attorney [laughter], mhm, oh just because you have the uh the power you can use uh you know skills to be able to affect people live people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being uh an assistant in that field, oh uh a lot of it is not around anymore just have brothers and sisters out of state so not particularly close right now, uh mm dishonesty unkindness , lack of sympathy, uh

walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach areas is kind of fun rodeo drive occasionally, and uh and see films, art art galleries, oh uh my daughter, i just have one daughter who graduated u_c_l_a law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work, uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing, uh just uh i'd say peer pressure, it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good, , so that was a really bad time for us, um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh, i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now, i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a , uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think, you know kind of uninspired right now, um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy, um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work, oh gosh about a couple weeks ago, oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you, um just stressed, yeah stressed more stressed, mhm, um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested, uh not depression, um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and, i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know, um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law, and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down, from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow, there is a xxxx, back back, just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me , and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again, you know, well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now, and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing, i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question, uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened, so it's hard to i'll probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always, the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah, i don't think so i tried everything to avoid it [laughter] you know and so uh, uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life, i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome people's perceptions or their judgments of you if you can, effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself, that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that, um, well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh, you know just um the experience of thinking thinking that that was a after all the years that was a success her graduating from law school, yeah, uh just, like a lot of work had a good ending, uh you know happy glad that it was fulfilled wishes or or dreams for this child were fulfilled, you know that and she was able to make that success, wow um [laughter], i i i tend to be kind of happy with life 'cause the alternative is gonna harm harm your you know your ability to succeed, so i try to force happiness i guess in in most every situation in my life route i find something about it uh when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy, i travel a little bit locally i traveled more when i was younger i really enjoyed that but just been too busy in the last few years, just new places um ability to take the worries we have every day work , or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new , you know kind of the way, i'm going back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale and uh and spent the night there and um and it was just during spring when there aren't many skiiers and it was just beautiful and very quiet, a lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was beautiful, yeah, wow uh, just, um ardent i'm hard working loyal uh, um creative, um just seeing something that you're creating you're trying to create uh becomes something you hoped the picture would be you know if if that's the case, you know just hard work uh just fulfilled or or presented itself in a certain way that you know it makes you happy, to my daughter um very [ver] pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she send me pictures all the time, okay, bye",0

regionally, meeting old people <laughter> i love talking to old people, um, well i work a lot with uh my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in california, and i spend a lot of time with uh with the elders and i talk with them and they help me out a lot, so i get to hear good stories, mhm, mm, uh going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls that no one else had seen except for my people, yeah that was the most beautiful thing i think i found, mm, mhm <laughter>, um it depends on the situation if i'm um if somebody comes to me, looking for me to help them i take control, but if i need help it's eh i i work at asking for help so, it depends on the situation, mhm, i garden, and i paint, mm i'm very good at it, uh three days ago it was about communication it was uh the lack of communication on the other person's part, and, i needed them to communicate better so that way i could understand, uh they didn't communicate so we had an argument, and uh got it settled <laughter>, i felt um caught off guard, because this is a individual that i spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise, you know i was kept out i didn't like that, uh, mm i'd rather pass <laughter>, mm, uh, um probably the lack of time spent with my grandparents, growing up, it's just when they're gone you regret that you didn't miss time with spent time with them, so, mm, uh one thing i truly wish i could remember i i was a, i was a professional athlete at one time and, i had partied 'til like four in the morning and then i had did my event at like ten o'clock in the morning, and uh, i was my captain and i embarrassed my whole team, and uh, that's one thing i truly regret, i was a professional fighter so, yeah <sigh> like not party thought about other people besides myself, mhm, uh, i studied uh massage therapy and got my nursing degree, um, and a lot of it's just been on job education, um very close, uh, uh due to my own injuries um, i had just gone through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked, and i decided to do that i wanted to help people too, yeah, oh yeah yeah, yes, i wanna paint, that's all i wanna do is just paint <laughter>, um, i have two sons and it's time for me to uh, to move on and they're older, and they can take care of themselves now, so me leaving the area where my sons are, it's pretty hard, yeah, oh, the reflection of you <laughter> the reflection of you, reminds you so much about yourself, who you are, consistency, even when you're sick <laughter> being consistent, i don't assume my kids are right or wrong, i listen to 'em first, and i make my decisions after that, and i try not to come from an emotional, heightened place, i think logically and i put myself in their place, before i do it we discuss we communicate heavy in my family, uh 'cause that's the only way we get along with each other is through communication, so communicate, um my family is severed pretty much so my family and my relationship with my family, on the reservation is very tight, um the rest of the family we're all fragmented and scattered around the southwest so it's not very tight at all, uh, i have too many to count um, start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad raised me a good way, uh , uh he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age, um, he also taught me to protect my family, and taught me honor, taught me love, he's a good man, mm i don't i haven't had a good night's sleep in years so i i have get broken sleep, uh dreams the dreams become too real, i get up and go to the bathroom <laughter> and go back to sleep <laughter> i try to <laughter>, um <sigh> um, my years of fighting it just uh it caught up to me, , uh reserved, yeah, reserved and i try to find things to distract my brain i think of different ways of doing things, uh, mm, well i got rid of t_v about eight months ago so i got rid of that distraction so what i do now is, i either paint, i garden, or cleaning house washing dishes, you know or get out and go walk that's another thing too do a lot of walking nowadays, uh anxiety <anxi> anxious <sigh> uh um a lot of anxieties, uh but it's good i have techniques to bring myself down now, um, nothing new, out of the normal, yes, uh three years ago <sigh> around there three <sigh>, insomnia issues, um it was about, two years ago around there, two little bit over two years ago i was released from therapy, oh the therapist released me, um, well i had i noticed is i still deal with pictures and emotions, but what i do is now i've i really practice hard at taking care of myself and and getting to those places the things that, strike me that get get me anxious or excited or angry, i've learned how to, work out of it and realize it's not real, it's not real, it's just the emotion it's not real, so these are the things like little mantras that i tell myself, and this has really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real, and yeah so therapy has helped a lot i mean it's just it's changed my world, yes, around the same time as the p_t_s_d, uh three years ago, um <sigh> in my dreams when i dream i do, last night, i was just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight and that was another thing too i build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight, and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then i always end up fighting in my dreams, so it's always mm what gets me scared in all my dreams is that i should've made the move and finished the fight and i didn't, and so it builds anxiety and stress in me and then i tend to act out in my sleep, yeah, like it was real like i was there, like like i smell taste feel everything there i was there, yeah, uh this morning, <laughter> driving here, talking to my girlfriend, this mm, trustworthy, he loves me i love him, he's we're best friends, i have zero to change, mm, i can't recall, regret, uh, just not spending time with my grandparents and and, i think day to day issues maybe you know a couple here there that i should've went to the store first or something like that but i mean, yeah it's nothing like that , quit thinking you know it all, yeah, my loyalty, my trustworthiness, mm start a new art project yesterday, it was nice, mm, well i i, we were in santa barbara and we found some rocks and yeah some old rocks that someone had made a pile of and just threw a dump of old rocks out of the way and i went through the pile of rocks and, i found this old rock that was in the middle of it, and i took it home and now i'm doing a art piece on it and for me it was like this thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock, and now potentially it'll be sitting on my grandkid's table you know it's just to me that's really cool i like that, mm, start starting something, that, i'm so bad at, that i don't think there's no way i can be good at it and all the sudden i get, to be better at it to where i don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way i could just touch it and feel it and i don't think about it, i these are the things that i'm proud of like, i like that i like that, accomplishment i guess you can say, mm, bye <laughter>, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan",17
337,"yeah, i'm doing okay, how are you doing, i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley, i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just, not, as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a, like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other, uh, don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean, there's not that much i don't like, i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that, yes, right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera, so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to, performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily, so it's actually a pretty good gig, and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that, do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the , because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter>, so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life, sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people, but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family , don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know, i'd rather keep to myself, uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so, but like, thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and, you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together , but it's, somewhat close, mostly i sing or i read or i write or, just, hang out and try to, clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just, clear everything and see what starts coming back in, and, sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things, um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever, works but, mostly in my free time i create things, i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um, i mean my idea of, like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip, and i like to travel more um, i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel, seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change , i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of , where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that, but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>, <laughter> <clears throat>, um, let's see, a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line, um my cousin and i would take what we call, exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just , sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off, so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight, just small short trips that, aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how, um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas , so close to home but not, but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that, kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway, so i i like i like doing that, the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that, we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am, and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live, so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas, and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda, i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there, and we came back and was, you know, an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so, it was kind of an interesting, uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back , and, i actually, like to see people who are, strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate, or what have you, so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason, you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it, just that kinda really just makes me mad, when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either , you know verbally just, cutting 'em with a quip or, you know, i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody, but i'll try to you know, if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works , not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to, get them to leave me alone, um, so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction, and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if , it's is trouble it's usually trouble that, it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of , so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it, uh the last time i argued with somebody, like, person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my, uh the last thing i can think of was, i, argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia, and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a, i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her , and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us, because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process , but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like, i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that, it, brings you, a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened, when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it , and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it, but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her, yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually, and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care, but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad, but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore, so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do, i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that, so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's, a dual effort it's very much a dual effort, but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like, a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but, lively discussion <laughter>, you know than debate, meh, it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever, and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you, so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy, but you deal with it and you you move on, uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother, 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually, gave me a lot of confidence, and but were realistic about it, so i mean i think i have sort of a, realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over, and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life, and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed , i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions, now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home, my focus was to get her home, so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year, eating just horrible foods when i did eat, so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick , and i'm wondering well if i didn't, if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded, would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em, and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she , uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and, her health insurance provider missed that, so she wound up having, sort of this whole, catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down, she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke, and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her, and i know, there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her, if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have, oh i know i am <laughter> but it's, my desire to take responsibility, for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really, direct them into my own vision because they're their own, individual beings, and they can't you know, be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be, but i still have you know my ideals, and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too , fit into my life, in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings, and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well, is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs, and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but , it's still, kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it, um, ten or twenty years ago, probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she, got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her, and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside , the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years, so, i think i i probably would've done that, um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate, your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family, to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself , ten years ago <laughter>, no, no, no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know, and i mean it's not, i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances, and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment, and of it gets <ge>, um, after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know, if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't, but, how could i convince myself of that, um two weeks after she died i wound up with, pulmonary embolisms, in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if, you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um, i mean i wound up having to take more medication, because of that, uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to, get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like, the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so, that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore , so, and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just, you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now, and it, it's been, a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up, just stay in bed and sleep all day you know, but then, realizing that, when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies, i took that responsibility of doing it for them, so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't, they didn't you know so, they eh they actually got me up and, and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them, if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been, you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably , and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for , for me i mean for me making selfish decisions , so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is, to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care , as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but, i have a family to look after now , so i have to go out and do things , you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know , but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm , been working on on a balance of the two, very <laughter> but it's worth it, i mean , it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter> , but keeping, a residence down paying bills things like that , it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that , and i and and i know that , but , it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up , but then , it's like well what's the alternative , i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life , 'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna , be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever , and i wouldn't get anything done , uh very , anxious and nervous and i mean what if , i don't find , enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um , you know what what if i can't , keep, a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but , what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs , and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that , but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in , so that's actually , a source of , anxiety , but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it , but i i i know it it's a cycle, and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is, the fundamental thing i need to take of here , i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what, is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue , and so , figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit, but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again , mm i'll have to , uh , figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it , you get over it pretty quickly you get through it , the last time i felt really happy, i don't know, zz, um, i , huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me , because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda, eh in the middle, um, really like overjoyously happy i don't know , i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened, i don't know you don't know , perceptions of other people i mean , probably as somebody who , oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know , handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that , at all, and it's a it, probably that i can think on my feet and, i'm not afraid to , hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done , um that , and i can do it creatively and i try to , strive for balance , probably , probably the best things about me <laughter> , that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not , um, you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to , who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got, a career that she , it's more of a job that she fell into , 'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer , and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time , but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and, she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda, stole all the money from her business so she lost her business , and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early , she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it , and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it , and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is , yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can , be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me , people i actually like in my life and , be happy with that , and i see a lot of people who aren't , and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that , and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now, thank you <laughter>, okay , thank you <laughter>, goodbye",10
373,"yes, uh does it okay makes it okay, um, northern karolina, yep, almost four years ago, um i graduated from college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started this with a group of friends and then got work afterwards and enjoyed the city so much and work here since, yep, uh probably three < th>, mostly three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe a random trip there, mhm, um, it's.., i just started to get home, in the sense of that respect, where, like going home, now goes home, like going back to my family and, to see some friends, but i feel more, i feel more than i belong in loose angels than i am back home, the food goes around the weather without saying uh, i like the resources there i like to feel., i like that the things i want to do are much more accessible out here than they would be., in north carolina, so i feel like i'm uh., i'm capable of tracking., eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina, i mean, the cost of living isn't great, but at the same time, i always say that people like part of the rent have access to so much., resources <resour> so many resources out here, so it's not even expensive like new york or boston, it's not the worst, but.., uh and also i mean, it's a little annoying that every time i want to go home, it's a flight not a ride that i can't mean, imaginable < con> really conceivable, go home for the holiday because it's a three or four day adventure and just not practical, so it's uh unhappy that i'm so far away in this regard, but, i can't change geography., uh, <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media science and production, uh yes i work as a freelance author and producer, in college i realized that i was pretty good at it and i knew there was a way to monetize that and i got out of here and worked a little uh in the, uh public sector in the attempt, you know, just do these jobs this way and i realized i could, making more money have more control over my schedule and my life when i did it freelance, so i have to do it now for a little more than a year now, i love traveling i try to uh, go somewhere new for a good time, about all uh seven to eight months just trying to mix things up, so i was in barcelona only recently, and i plan, either vietnam or even back to europe in the next few months so, mhm, i enjoy the break from the routine, i think while it's nice to wake up and somehow have a vague idea where your day is going, after a few months you can get a lot into that and you, uh pigeonhole i appreciate your thought process your expectations for the day and i love to wake up in a foreign country and just, knowing that everything i do that day will be brand new and different from what i would do if i was in los angeles or, and around our own routine, so i'm a big fan of it and i love the food, so it's great,, just eat a lot of food i love in the places where they were originally created, yeah, sure i went to uh., barcelona as i said a few months ago and that was mostly because i had a girlfriend who lived there for six or seven months and she asked me to come out again and again, and uh i finally i was at a point in work where i had worked so much for months at the end that i felt like i had earned a break, so i went there for two weeks, and yes, it was one of the healthiest wisest things i've done in a while, so i, mm reminded me once again how important it is for me to at least travel and get out of the world, i'm very extraordinary, i love talking and talking to people., even virtual people, oop, i lost you., to relax me, listen and play music much i like to read uh i like to, go watch movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy, cooking around uh my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance around so i haven't seen her for weeks and that can be very uh, sadly obvious, so i'll talk to her as much as i can, but yeah, just uh, um uh pretty simple tastes, yep, this is embarrassing is not, to me i don't really have a lot of temperament so uh very good i guess i'm not getting really easily or quickly angry and uh, when i do it, i'm usually aware enough that i can, somehow formulate how i feel and why i feel so and what, i want to do it, so it's nice., i guess i'm a pretty loose guy in this respect, to be honest, it was probably a small thing, like, uh wrongly remembers when uh, something was done or like a date on something or like a fact was probably nothing emotionally heated, and it was just about yes, i think it was probably about like, try to figure out exactly when we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as the other person, thinking the other person wrong remember so to know in you small or big situation it is very difficult for me to feel really angry, uh i think in the classical sense of the word, to <sigh>, i'm trying to think that i'm not one who regrets it., i just did a project., like a movie and uh the subject had a little to do with like an ex girlfriend of mine so when it came time to publish it, i pointed out that i didn't want to send it directly to her because i didn't want her to think it was me., does to her face, but i sent it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see things and i want to, uh maybe that <tha> she could have misunderstood that as passive aggressive, i don't know about, but yes, i mean, that's something i've been thinking about, but i don't regret it as much as maybe i could have just left it., uh everyone else i wasn't sure if i should trip, unlike me it to them so, only my thoughts there, the hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh>, uh, it was actually probably uh likely that uh, ah i wasn't even making a hard decision with as i said with that same ex girlfriend i mentioned that it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh, break up with her after something happened and, it was difficult because i took great care of them, but it wasn't difficult to come to the conclusion that i was, um, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, enough with her, but at the same time it wasn't uh, the easiest thing that somehow goes through this process to get on a roller coaster that you are very aware of how mm will be terrible or frightening it, but you know you have to hit the roller coaster so uh so yeah, i'd say that's probably from new memory, i was just.., a plethora of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the best person for me so, as i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much data to find out it was pretty clear signs and i have no regret about doing it now to, i don't know., yes i feel very strong then about it and i still felt very strong that i made the right choice now, around <sigh> it may be, it can be hard, there are <b> they will make me feel it's either when i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've started to train again, which is a great help, but i would say that when i go to bed at night, i never know how it's going to happen sometimes, sometimes i wake up in an hour after sleep and i can't sleep again or, i'm just gonna get up and get up regularly, so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks, but uh yeah, like i said, especially with my current girlfriend uh not around, like i said, she's a very, great source of comfort around like this uh around but she travels a lot for work, so it's something to have to adapt and uh, uh sleep can be some that suffers from it, but uh in the same way i'm not someone who actually feels like i don't need too much sleep i, if i can get, if i can get four to six hours, i'm in pretty good shape on that day so, um, uh little timid i guess uh little more <mo> more just around, whenever i get out of a task, there's always the question of what i am, what's next, and i don't have the next one., to project set up, so it's always that nervousness around in the past something usually comes, so you can set the precedent of it usually works, but until it does, you are getting a little, um, uh anxious and it can be depressing because it's like uh, you know that i have chosen a lifestyle that, while i have a lot of control and autonomy over my life, also weighs everything on me to do it, and you know, sometimes i'm around i'm very jealous of, the idea that people are just waking up going out into an office for eight hours and don't have to think about this work as soon as they leave the office and somehow the dynamics of a, group of people or enterprises, you wear it when it's a little hard while like me when i have a day off or when i'm a sick day to get no job done <laughter> you know i'm a small company that has an employee, how can i handle this?, you.., i suppose you mean, i guess,, uh, people i work with, how i work with the, uh maybe the better answer would be how to cope with this lifestyle and just i've gotten a lot more used to it, something that i'm still learning and finding how to, how to use uh as far as i don't just know how rewarding the work is when i do it, but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live life and, you know how i uh what is the appropriate way to budget finance, which is the, uh expectation i should have for myself in a certain year, which is realistic, which is hopeful uh and that's something i'm sure to take years and years, but i feel as long as i'm getting better, then it is the progress right, uh yeah uh definitely once and then probably me if i had gone back uh, i had gone to high school, probably it would have been the second time, but yes, i was once diagnosed with depression, so i feel it's one of those things i have to keep an eye on., all my life, you know, i feel like a pretty happy person for most of it, but around uh, they have i hate as annoying as it is, but as they say, like with people who are very creative or people who tend to do a lot of stuff with the mind it is, and i understand that it's a self esteem thing because it's so hard to feel, to get so hard <har> or so easy i should think <shou> into your own head that, that was within a year, so i probably felt, uh symptoms were there before it was somehow easy to figure out how ah you know it somehow happened again so i feel uh the symptoms again uh, and to go through these emotions and feel like i was okay in the beginning i had somehow hoped that it would be something i could work through myself, but i realized it was just stupid for me to try the fight alone, so i went and see a therapist, uh uh really bad that's when i just couldn't sleep at all as if i might get an hour's sleep one night best around i wasn't sleeping at all, had just no <sigh> uh no drive to do anything, whether it was as easy as brushing teeth or, my apartment things like to clean this and just at the same time to be aware that it's like oh that's all in my head and it's not even like a, a symptom around, uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression, no, i'm just done. i mean, since i didn't graduate or anything, but i got to a point where i was like.., um, i talked through as much as i could talk through and, i had moved on to other places in my life, it was kind of good., good work especially as i said i was working on something i was really interested in i am now with someone i am very interested in, and um, there's such a possible opportunity for me not even to worry about the symptoms and so much, now that, uh i felt like therapy wasn't necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to go with so much work so, oh, i definitely think you can have someone you can trust who isn't your boyfriend or family member who isn't, you know, have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or something like that is definitely something beneficial i can't imagine how someone could not benefit from that on a somewhat routine basis, to <sigh>, i don't know that i'm a company <f> a kind of solid creditor that all these things like the things that can somehow haunt you are also for a reason like uh, my sister died when i was about twelve years old and she was younger than me., and watching my parents see my father crying for the first time was a very, kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot on that day, so it's also hard to see that and see how my parents had to deal with the loss of a child, i don't want to forget these things because i think they're very integral to, how i cope with life and how i perceive uh, having difficulties and obstacles and the image of knowing my father on it is very human, because it is so simple, somehow, you idolize your parents, and i still adore my father, but to know that he's a guy like me, and when i get older, it's easier to deal with, the man he is, so i'd be 16 or 6, um, i like the idea that they always say you wouldn't worry about what people thought about you when you realize how much people didn't think about you, and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old, and i don't know what it means to tell a six year old., but yes, i feel special when you're in high school until it's time for me to think you're living in los angeles today., so much is trapped in how people think about you and i'm still very much when i find someone anyway is either upset about me or don't like it bothers me to a large extent or i hate to let people down so, i would like to come to a healthier place where only know that sometimes you just can't really control, as people think about you, even if you have the best intentions in the world so, i'm a very compassionate guy, i'm here for my friends, i'm pretty selfless in this respect., to have a good humor about things like having <laughter> even with depression or depression i can joke about it's not you know i'm not morbid, depresses more only that i'm aware when i'm uh, i'm low and uh i treat it as such and, i don't know, i'm not trying to deny it, i'm not trying to like any of it, but i.., i've got a i'm a i'm a pretty, like practical person in this respect i don't think uh even though i'm depressed, i don't take it from people or i don't think people have told me that they don't even seem when i, mention that <cough> has gone through like depression no one seems to like or don't mention it, i feel like if i go through it it's as oh everyone can just say and, i'm just a smoking gun., sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i tend to wear it pretty well and uh, i don't lose eyes of uh, reality <rea> the reality of what i know happens so, mm, i was on a.., my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two, but she cancelled this trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and around, yes i know i <laughter> i love her she's great around her is the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh, so we got them for ten days and we just had how normal we get rarely normal couples time, as it always is, how oh i see you for five days and, then one of us has to go somewhere to be normal for ten days, where we can just cook at home., lying in bed reading books or something was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have, someone i can do this with and it feels so practical and feels so right, um, i guess for i'm a good guy like i know i know i don't know uh, i don't think i'm kidding people, i'm not a good friend to have, i'm there for people i'm looking for people i care about., uh about people and what they think about me and that's especially true for my friends and, i'm trying to make sure you know with a lot of my friends on the east coast i'm trying to carve time to make sure they know that i'm thinking about them and i'm calling them, and so i feel like uh for many people who am me as their friend, probably one of their better in the sense that i know how much i appreciate and respect the friendships we have., thank you, ellie., see you.",9
313,"safe, uh, okay i guess not bad not good, so that's it., denver colorado, uh to track job opportunities, about two years ago, once or twice a year, i really like the sunshine., to do all the possibilities of all the different types of people a lot, something like this kind of thing, i hate traffic, i wish the seasons were clearer, and that everything here costs a lot of money, pretty simple, hmm, i'd say uh, people are rude, um, not have enough money, what else?, mm only a lot of things are frustrating i guess, <cough>, i guess it depends, what i'm upset about when it's on another person or about something i've done or just life in general, uh, if someone annoys me like a person, i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop, is that what you're talking about?, all right., so not as good as i would like to be, uh, a few days ago about getting paid for something i did in time, i'm pretty pissed off., benefits from the, i like going to the gym, uh hang out with friends reading, write, something like this kind of thing, timely mm, because, sometimes i like to think of myself and don't feel like a lot of external emotions, i have a degree in liberal arts in political science, no, i work in sales, uh, hmm, to own uh, several of my own companies and and have a lot of money coming from different streams, i guess if this is a job, uh, i used to live in mexico city, that was quite unforgettable, to see it was quite different from everything i've ever experienced, it was a lot of fun, a lot of new things and new people exposed, uh, i was pretty young carefree good times, not recently, but i have travelled quite a lot in my life, let's see., i went to london, that was a lot of fun pretty cool city, little too expensive, but definitely cool, about what is everything in life, um, let's see., boy, that's a good question., moving to l a was pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to uh move here so that was unforgettable i would say, < sniffle>, empty the throat , hmm, maybe how, six months ago, things just went well., had not much stress in my life, yeah, it's me., lightly irritated, and uh, scream more tired more, kind of down feeling down more, not so productive, yeah, a while ago., uh, hmm, mm doesn't know exactly, it's been a few years, but i still feel the same as i did when they diagnosed me, so i guess i'm still depressed, um, well, i'm just a big believer talking to people about your problems, so i just thought, that would uh, be a good idea, so i did it and that's what i found out., oh, yeah, definitely., i mean, it depends on what you mean by therapy, like me or most people probably can't afford good therapy, but just talking to friends, i'd be someone listening, so help you get stuff from your chest, empty the throat , thank you., well, i didn't necessarily see a therapist in himself, but when you talk to someone who listens and you and you get stuff, like out there like out of your head or whatever it is it uh it helps to destress i think, hmm, pretty girl, < slaughter>, < slaughter>, um, i'm a good leader i'm really smart, uh, to be able to , um, surviving alone in a city like this without help from the outside, yeah, a lot of things., um, just stupid mistakes i made when i was younger that, looking back now with what i know now i probably wouldn't have done, um, i would say to myself that i should listen as much as possible to people older than me., hmm, , he's always good for a, a kind of pep conversation, but with a dose of reality that he doesn't attract, so talking to him always helps me to give perspective., um, aged, and, i don't know well about things i'm good at a lot of things people seem to notice that i think i'm nice good disposition funny, see you later.",7
378,"yes, pretty good, i grew up in boston, about thirty years ago, yep, not too often, maybe once a year sometimes less, oh, i love living in l a, i never want to live anywhere else, well, i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and, the weather was good and, that's part of it., very simple, good maybe something easy the beginning of the first few weeks was really hard, just being in a new environment and being away from everyone i knew, but after a few weeks it was great, radio journalism, well, it's something i've wanted to do since i was 12., and all i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was somehow in pursuit of this dream, no <laughter>, well, it's kind of a long story, but i was fired from my first job when i was, in my twenties, and, it's just, once i had done this work, i realized that this is not really what i wanted to do, it was also, it just wasn't suitable for me, it didn't make me happy., yep < sigh>, my dream job works with football players and helps them to recover from concussion and other injuries, <deep breath> good the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is to find the right people and work the connections with them, it, i'm not so much on the road anymore., i love to see different places and different things like i love to go to places that don't like, where i come from, my favorite trip is that i was in australia for my thirtieth birthday., because i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday when i crossed the international date limit., and i went to this really small place on the, uh west coast of australia called shark bay, where native dolphins live and swim, and is for the most part very isolated and i have to be there for a whole week and only really a lot of myself, with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you, and it's amazing just a beautiful place in the world, more shy <sigh>, < deep breath> why < sigh> hm that's a good question around, the first thing i think about is because i've always been like this., but maybe that's an excuse i don't know., i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than many people, so sighing , i'm looking at a lot of t v <sigh>, or that's probably not the best alternative, but it's something i do, and i also go to the beach because i live near the beach, so that's one of my favorite things to relax, , it depends on the situation, but most of the time i'm pretty good, i don't think i tend to argue with people, i think i just get angry about situations, but not in humans directly <sigh>, i don't know if i'm feeling guilty about anything right now., i don't know if i have one right now., <deep breath> sounds of other people's noise make me really angry, i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and disgusting., not considerate, about her neighbors that makes me really crazy, yeah, look at me., hmm <sigh>, well, the only one that comes to mind from the top of my head is when i bought my apartment, it felt like a really hard decision at the time, you know, i didn't know i could do it, i wasn't sure if i had the money to do it., so that felt like a really difficult decision, but in hindsight of course it proved to be a big decision, but at the time it was really difficult to do that, pretty easy i sleep pretty well <sigh>, <deep breath> mostly good i'm just really worried about money at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say i'm how big, but i'm worried, but you know i'm confident it'll work., no <sigh>, yes, hmm <sigh>, i don't know i can't remember., i mean, i don't feel, super happy all the time, but i don't feel unhappy either somehow like just uh, even, kiel, well, i have to go to the.., my friends work at the film academy so i can see all oscar nominated films, , she was there one night, so i really enjoyed catching up with her and, to see them again, so that was very pleasant <sigh>, , they would say to be reliable, and, loyal < sigh>, and, considerate and considerate, i've been working really hard on it., i think, there are many things i might do differently, but there's nothing i really regret, um, well, i think there are things., the, to <sigh>, as if it wasn't worth wasting the energy, thinking about things i regret, so i didn't regret much about things, deep breath oh, that's a good question sigh don't worry about that little stuff , and save more money <laughter>, for example , well, there are, uh, you know, normal things like i'd lose more weight and i'd like to, uh.., think a little more fearless maybe <sigh>, be a little braver, i don't think i have them., i'm self employed, so i'm working all the time <laughter> so my ideal weekend is to have a lot of customers., um, this is something i enjoy, um, so that would be ideal at this point my weekends if i were really busy, <deep breath> that i was really able to take care of myself and that, you know i did pretty much everything i said i wanted to do., i did this., and i don't and i have no regrets about things there's nothing really that, eh, is unfeeling undone, surely in my life there are many things i still want to do, um, but.., i feel like i did what i said., yeah, that's not so great, it's okay, my parents both died, and i have a sister and a brother., um, i feel closer to my brother than to my sister, but.., they both live on the east coast and i live in l a, and then i have my sister has two girls, so i feel very close to my nieces, even though we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers., they have other things in mind, <deep breath> to probably my teacher, a person from whom i have learned my holistic bodywork, i really like it, <sigh>, model my work and my way of being after him, as if he were a good example, for me the way he keeps his work and how he lives his life, we're pretty close, we don't know the best friends, but i know i can call him anytime i need him., around <sigh> put me in a good mood <sigh>, usually with my friends or go to dinner, or by < sigh>, yeah, i'm just spending time with my friends, all right., thank you <sigh>, see you.",1
434,", yes, i am., i'm doing very well today., i'm originally from chicago illinois, when i was three, i moved out of here., yes, i'll never go back, family affairs, it depends on what you are in, if you notice, about the fast life and hollywood that doesn't compare it at all, if you're into the cold weather, you'd rather be out there, i like the sun., i'm going to.., my mom and dad broke up., it's okay., i have no idea i was only three when i moved here., i like the sunshine, i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in spring winter, autumn and summer i like the beaches i like hollywood, i like that the sailors are here and, and, <laughter> i love people it's a different kind, i think, l a is a microcosm of the united states, the people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and from all over the world, they come to l a for a better opportunity, so that's what i like about l a, oh, gang violence, < slaughter>, no not really i once traveled to arizona and once to stockton california, and another time to barstow california, but i don't travel much right now especially because of the finances, i studied alcohol and drug counseling, i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that what i should do with my life help people to overcome their addiction, so, um, that was a kind of simple choice i got some advice from people and, i just walked in., just to see what it was, and, i finished school and, have an intership and has been hired and so, i think that's what i'm supposed to do with my life., i'm not working right now, i actually moved away and, i had to take a deep breath, i was married and we had to move because the rent was cheaper, so i had to give up the job., to take this step, but since i came back down, i've been filling out applications and sending resume and trying to get interviews so that i can get back into the consultation, all right., it can sometimes be very difficult because, um, i have a felony uh and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly, and but the normal dopes i can, and then you need to be certified and i'm not yet certified, you need to work a certain amount of hours to be certified before they even allow you to do the test, you need to work a certain amount of hours, so right now, i'm just trying to get interns you know, try to help interns and show people what i can do as a consultant because everything about me isn't seen on my resume and around, yes, they just want people to be certified in order not to be certified in order to experience, and the fact that i have a felony makes it difficult, <laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility, um, or as an author, you know that the <de> depends, that depends on, on persons who are primarily , adaptation of my personality to the people i am around when people are kick then i will be kick when they are standoffish, then i may seem shy, but i'm not shy, i just give them their space and allow them to decide when they want to open, but if people open up right away, i'll open up right away., < slaughter>, i mainly listen to music or, i'll watch youtube, writing poems, um, or i just close my eyes and just lie down and pretend i can sing what i can't., so <laughter> that's, and another thing i do is, i eat ice cream <laughter>, controls my temperament, i'm very good at it it depends on what it is, i have to say that, the last time i lost my temper, it was because i felt it was someone., to scare my mother, so i lost my temper, but ninety nine times from a hundred, i don't lose my temper, i don't like to raise my voice and, i like to be calm and cool and i like that everyone feels comfortable, i don't want anyone to be scared or anything, there's no reason that someone's scared and that we're angry and, you know we're skipping our frustrations with people who had nothing to do with it., i just think that, and i think angry outbursts to be a link around, heart problems and high blood pressure, so i definitely don't want, well, i just told you about um., it was my mother's husband and, to tell you the truth, i could have handled it differently, but when i saw the look in my mom's eyes, i just lost him and i grabbed myself., you know, i told my mother, um, i don't like it., i've seen this guy abuse my mother, but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in her relationship, but when i saw how she was afraid in her eyes, that triggered a part of me., the, i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so, i should have just left., i should have just gone and then gone home and rest and get up the next morning, went to church, but.., yes we had a great time explosion and that caused and that caused a lot of damage for about six to nine months, so, yes, these six nine months i can't go back, yes, well, my brother's in prison, and i haven't seen him in 20 years since he's been there, and my sister moved to chicago for twenty years., thirteen years ago, i haven't seen her since, so i'm just close to my mother., and, my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and, how this is going to go out for me, i just know you know that i have a small family and, i have family in chicago, but, i don't know., to snoop around the side of the family just because.., of what i have seen, and heard, so i just don't want it to happen to me at all, so i just keep my distance, someone who had a positive influence <inf>, i'd say influence in my life, , taught me how to control my temperament and how to express my emotions without expressing my feelings that threaten someone else., and, taught me how, how to monitor my feelings and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and if they are really strong, then i just have to be quiet until, that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not only emotionally, and of course he is, he was the one who encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol consultant to get him, twenty seven years clean and sober at the moment he lived on skid row and he was the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something i'll never forget, feel guilty about, my grandfather, um died in two thousand four, and, at that time i just got out of prison, about two thousand two, i just came out of prison and he came to me and he, told me in so many words that he wouldn't be there that long., but i didn't get it because i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was full of things that i considered more important than that, plus the fact that i didn't understand what he said, but, when he died, i found out he told me., that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go, but i couldn't see it then, and, i feel, i think about it all the time, something i can erase from my memory, what are you doing?, would be the day, my brother i beat my mother again and again that over and over and over again in my head and it's like, this is a memory that i can just walk without, over and over and over again and over again in my head, so yeah on that day that memory right there, i felt contradictory feelings, because on the one hand, on the one hand, my brother protected me, received from beat, and on the other side he hit my mother, so, was somehow in the middle, most nights i have not, i'm going to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably more than likely until seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep, it depends on the environment i'm in when i don't sleep well., i'll be irritable at some point, but it doesn't happen immediately, it depends on my environment and who's around me when there are difficult people who will be a challenge for me and.., when people are loose, no one will know i haven't gotten much sleep., how i've felt lately, i just feel like.., the, it'll be better for me soon., to make some better decisions, to take advantage of the opportunities that come to mind, take advantage of my talents and meet the right people, this can open the right doors for me, so i'm very excited about it, even if it doesn't happen, i'll send out a million resumes, i don't care if i get it., five interviews, i'll never stop because i know that a consultant is my life's job, and, and i'm also meant to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people, to know about me because i had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot of humanity to offer, so it's just a matter of time before, um, that the public is exposed to what i've collected, my behavior i'm gentler, to laugh more humorous, i let a lot of things go that i'm always just, let me check it out., and angry me and things i can't control, like trying to control people or trying to make sure people don't betray me and, you just can't control me thinking i'm mentally mature., and psychologically eh, and the, the acquisition of a sense of humor was a big breakthrough for me, so, i know that my thoughts have changed and my thoughts have changed my behavior, i still have to monitor it., my thoughts and behavior i still have to monitor, but overall i am, you know., back then, i tolerated myself., actually like me and around it will erhove <beh> behoove you, the same way to feel, no, i didn't., no, last time i felt happy was last night because the lakers won the basketball game, < slaughter>, yeah, that's good., my best friend would describe me, he calls me the truth, because i always tell the truth and people try to hide things and i always reveal it, they can't hide it from me around i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it, and i see things days and months before they start to happen, i know human behavior when i see it, and i sniff it out really well and it's just a gift that was given to me so that he calls me the truth because of how i interact with people and how people, to get clean with me, because when they look at me, they know that i see through them, as i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and, yes, that's why he calls me the truth <laughter>, um, i wish i never had, i wish i'd never gone to jail., i wish,, that i could change, all right., my economic status my employment status, and, my teeth, which is like a problem area for me, i have a lot, stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't care about my teeth and now that i have to be, um, trust about myself as i can be you know it always comes, i wonder if they look at my teeth, i wonder if they look at my teeth, i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are, but in the back of my mind there are those thoughts that say, look at my teeth, so i would really, to change that and i would change my height, i think i'd like to be, at least thirty five pounds heavier, but i'm working on it., twenty years ago, which would make me eighteen, i would have had a big time around high school basketball players for fremont high school at that time and i had colleges coming to see me and i would have given myself the opportunity, was away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i, could have played for the lakers last night, but, hey, i am very proud of the fact that, you know what i'm most proud of my mother?, really, really, um, she graduated from school., she had a full time job, a full time job, where she woke up., five o'clock in the morning, go to work, at three thirty of her job to go straight to college leaving college at nine o'clock a night she does this five days a week, and still had the power to keep them on the list of deans and presidents, so that all this, you know when they say , that older people can't do things, i just think that this rumor scatters around, and she recently got her around license as an evangelist in the church so, i'm just very proud of it and.., your life influenced people, in a positive way so yeah my mother, <laughter> okay thanks, goodbye.",2
474,"<synch>, yes, i'm good how are you, uh i was born in hawaii but i grew up in colorado, yeah, yeah, about seven <s> uh seven to eight years ago, um i try to go back once a year <ye> once or twice a year, yeah, um it's, how does it compare to l_a um it's, it's different it's not as busy, there's more uh things to do out outdoors in the mountains, uh my family <fam>, for work, yeah i am i love it here, um it took about a year before i really felt comfortable but, um, once that got through that kinda hard year it was pretty good out here i've had a good time, um i, love that i can go to the beach, uh i love that it's warm most of the time, uh i love that i've met a lot of people that love the arts as much as i do, the traffic just like everyone else, um, yeah, yeah the traffic and, it's pretty much just traffic, earthquakes, not as much as i'd like, um it's just nice to go some place new, experience something different, um i went to alaska a couple years ago and that was really awesome, i got to go fishing in the ocean and i got seasick that wasn't awesome but uh, it was cool i saw a bear in real life a bear walked through a yard, um it was really different than l_a it was really cool, <laughter>, english creative writing, well i always wanted to tell stories so, it just made sense to work on writing in somehow some aspect, yeah i am, to, have my own t_v show where i write it and everyone watches it every week and it's awesome, really hard, 'cause there's a lot of people that have the same dream so, yeah, more outgoing than shy, uh i like talking to people i enjoy other people, mm um go to the movies or, turn on music dance, pretty good, um <sigh> it was at work couple about a month ago <ag> about a month ago, um i got, mad at someone because i didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions, and so um when i tried to have a conversation about it they got mad and then i got mad and, we got mad, um i felt like i wasn't being heard or listened to and, i felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so, um because we couldn't have a dialogue i felt like no one was listening to me, totally, um, <makes sound with mouth>, i uh, i i um, no regrets no <laughter> um <laughter>, i guess, hmm, i don't know if there is one i mean i'm sure there is but, uh one time i was driving behind someone and they well they cut me off, and, i think it'd just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago, um it was just one of those days where i just didn't want, or i just it had been a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got in an accident with them i just followed them to their parking spot, and, actually i had honked at them and they they flipped me off, and so it just really really got under my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh, and then flip me off, so i i followed them to the spot and i asked i said miss why did you flip me off when you cut me off, and and she said oh you know i'm, i've had a rough day i don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter and you know, i didn't need to be petty like that but i just, i wanted to be i guess, ooh <sigh> mm look at you going deep, <laughter> um, oh i guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom uh, telling her i was gay, i mean it wasn't hard 'cause it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she, she had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but once she did you know everything was better and i knew it would be, but it was just hard in the moment to, you know tell her something she didn't wanna hear, okay, um, when i was a little kid my um, my grandfather found our dog run over on the on the road, and he uh, , and brought it in and i think i remember as a kid just, uh like seeing death like that really just, threw me off and, uh frightened me and, uh it was just one of those moments that i i guess i wish i hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad, and uh, it was just one of those moments i guess you need as a kid but i didn't really wanna experience like loss like that in your face, yeah, my relationship with my family is pretty good um, we're probably not as close as most but uh we, you know we always, we don't talk often but we talk with love and we, always love each other when we see each other, um, my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me, to uh you know pursue my dreams and, not to let the little things get me down so i'm glad i had her, usually it's easy um sometimes it's not, um, well i've been between jobs recently i start a new job uh next week, but, while i've been off uh while i haven't been working um i tend to like, my body wants to stay up later and later and later and i'm trying not to like, fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven, so i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty, and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half, when i should be, i should <sh> i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine but, still wanna stay up i guess, uh a little scatterbrained like today i'm a little scatterbrained 'cause uh, i i tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and, so <sigh> scatterbrained <laughter>, um well since i've had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because, um you don't know what to do with it when you're not working i guess um, but, yeah, i think that answers the question, um i just that maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with uh the not working thing, no, mm mm, um a couple days ago when i got my new job <laughter> when i got hired, um, outgoing listening, uh attentive, um, fun, loyal, i think, i hope, um i wish that i, uh i probably wish that i looked better i wish i had more hair up here mm losing it a little bit, uh probably wish i was a little skinnier this, this girdle's pretty tight <laughter> and um, you know sometimes i wish i had more money but, nothing too drastic, i'm okay, yeah, oh um, mm hmm when i was a little kid, i was uh i was the fat <f> i was the fat kid, and um, gosh i remember i was like i was going into high school, and it was like the second day, and i remember this guy came up to me and was, um, like he was like pretty nice to me i thought, and i didn't realize he'd, like this is like out of a movie right like he had put bandaids on my back that said like i'm a fat cow, and said like uh like, yeah, like just a bunch of mean stuff and i didn't know and i walked around with it for like half an hour i heard people laughing and i didn't get it and then finally this girl just came up to me and was like hey, there's like bandaids on your back that say all these mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take 'em off, and i remember like i couldn't get 'em i was trying to find 'em and then, um, i just remember like putting my head in my locker and like, i didn't want anyone to see me cry so i just like put my head in my locker, and like pretended like i was looking at stuff in my backpack but really i was you know, the crying fat kid who couldn't get the mean stickers off his back, mm yeah, anything, um, probably, yeah, <sharp inhale>, um, you know, i would i would try to keep, i would try to let myself know to to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you, i think i spent too much time as like a adolescent, worrying what people thought of me, and as i got older i didn't care as much and i started enjoying life a lot more so, uh i went to coachella it's a music festival it was three days with, all of my friends and my boyfriend and we, uh we danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time, yeah, oh <sigh> um i guess my, my career humble as it may be, uh i really stuck in l_a um a long time, when it was uh, when like it was hard i stayed <stay> i stuck around i didn't quit so, you know i'm proud that i've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and, try to make it in hollywood, my pleasure, bye, bye, bye",4
377,"yeah go ahead, um i'm okay, i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while then i moved to california, mhm, i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been what eight months something like that, um <sigh>, at the most probably twice a year, um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um, and, i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so, um yeah things were were changing, in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial, um, main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so, so i gave it a shot and here i am, oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um, i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but, you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um, and, yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh, yeah, so, i love to travel i love it yeah i've i i lived in ireland and i traveled um, i was in morocco and i was in costa rica, um i've spent some time in mexico so, yeah, um i love <sigh> meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also, not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go, um sure well, i guess hmm, i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but, morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh, yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun, um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so, my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was, um being on a bus and and leaving, um dublin and going just out to the countryside and, seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but, when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible, yeah, um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies, no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so, i actually do sales, so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into, comes into play and eh so does my, i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach, um, to, guess i'm not clear on the question um, okay, wow um <sigh>, you know my dream job is, being a, a motivational speaker and trainer and coach, um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and, um really contributing to people, um my relationship's pretty good actually i, i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would, not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and, um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got in communication with my biological mother, um last may and we've been, we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so, um, well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother, um, i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so, yeah, i'm shy, um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance, i love to read, i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions, that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else, um, i like to be with friends um, i love art and, trying new restaurants um, yeah all those things are, both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that, um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so, yeah yeah, um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>, um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be, oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery, yeah that was the last time so, yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of, uh it didn't show up, and, uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until, um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and, they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place, so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that, the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so, i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated, oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um, let me think about one, um the other day i had a phone call, and i'm in a coaching program and, it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program, and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with, and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with, um, someone who's not my coach and uh that, hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these, people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to, not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know, so, yeah i wasn't um, i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and, it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but, um, yeah i could've, certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and, would've made the call go a lot smoother, hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few, i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision, no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was, challenging, um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i, moved, uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado, and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been, you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know, um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging, oh lots of things um, i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and, the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um, at the time i was very much into rock climbing, and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were, um in my age group and or single that was another factor um, and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit, so, yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but, um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move, yeah, uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>, relatively easily, it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then, you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today, but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty, anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um, but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily, um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of, out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um, yeah and i just i have to find, the financial means to support me in doing that and it's, and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing, so, yeah, um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation, um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can, there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do, and mm my money's not working at all, so yeah it feels pretty crappy, <laughter> thanks, i have in the past yeah, oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago, i was suicidal, oh yeah i feel down mhm, i don't actually no, um, well i originally stopped, with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had, worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed, and um and then i began therapy again, later on, think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties, um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so, yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous, i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see, and, you know work through that situation and come up with um, a strategy for, not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies, and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever, <deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow, huh, wow that's pretty sad, um it was at least a year ago, no i that's not true it was, when i um, saw my biological mother which was last may, my best qualities, um <sigh>, i'm very strong, very strong-willed, i um, am very supportive and loving and nurturing, um, i'm easy to be around, i'm intelligent, and, um, yeah, anything i regret, i don't think so, no, <sigh> don't take life too seriously, oh my ideal weekend, um i spend some time at the beach i'll spend some time with friends, um either going out at night you know to a movie or, just going out to um, a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together, um maybe go dancing after, um and sundays i usually go to, , and then i have brunch with friends and, um, yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so, hmm <sigh>, i am most proud of, um, a few things i mean, i've moved to places that i wanted to move to, and uh so i've done things that have really spoken to me and have, meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually, um, mm achieve those those um, goals or those, yeah i've done things that i've wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california, mhm, okay, sure, bye",16
470,"<synch>, yes, i'm doing okay, i'm from los angeles california, the food the weather and the people, mm, um, i don't know it's not too many things i really don't like about l_a maybe, some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in l_a, <laughter>, um no not too much, um i only been like to texas las vegas and, that's pretty much it, mhm, um, catching a airplane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my dad, and, going to las vegas a lot, that's, oh yeah um well, when i was younger i used to go visit my dad and 'cause he used to live in houston texas and i used to catch the airplane a lot, and that was a lot of fun i wasn't scared that was a lot of fun, and i enjoyed that <laughter>, um when i went to school i studied child development and nursing, um, i know i wanted to be somebody and when i went to school i wasn't sure what i wanted to be, so i kinda took um nursing the l_v_n program first, and then i didn't wanna be a nurse so i changed my major to child development and i graduated from that, no i'm actually looking for work i'm unemployed right now, my dream job would be, probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business, in my mind it's simple but like in reality it seem like it's kinda difficult <laughter>, sometimes i'm shy but i'm really an outgoing person and a people person, hmm, <laughter>, um to relax i listen to some slow music i kinda like um, have a quiet environment, and maybe lay down watch a little t_v or something, i'm very good at controlling my temper, i don't like to get really angry or upset, or, get to where, i'm fitting to hurt somebody <laughter>, um, when i really have arguments they're like because people don't agree to disagree, and then it's over <o> like really petty it's like, we might say oh it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that it's just stupid i don't even remember <laughter>, um, probably not working right now i need a job <laughter>, yes, um, maybe <sigh>, i don't really remember a situation i try to really think before i really handle a situation and i try to handle it in a my best positive way, before i really do something i regret, um being with somebody like a guy you know if i wanna continue a relationship with them, or just, be single, mm, um, my relationship with my family i don't have, i just really stay with my dad and i have a daughter, and we just stay close all my family they're either in um, houston texas, or, they're around but i don't really socialize with a lot of my family, my dad, because um i live with him right now i've been staying with him maybe about five <f> five to six years, and, he's just the only one i really look up to i don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and, that's it <laughter>, , she's in the fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the sixth grade and i'm kinda excited for that, sometimes it's easy but uh sometimes it gets a little overwhelming, um the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent, it's just you always have somebody to bring you joy i enjoy always doing things with my daughter, um it's just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always, it's brings me so much joy being a parent, well, um my parents when i was younger, they, lived apart so my mom, i don't know i'm i'm a much better parent 'cause i'm more interested about what my child wants to do i'm involved in her life, her every step just, i'm really fully involved my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem, so it just, i had to mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids, so, it was, um, just, my parents and um, their drug addiction i wish i could erase that from my memory, um now i cope with them, well but um when i was growing up it just was rough it was very rough, had to do a lot of things on my own, um they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know i just, i didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything it just was like i was in a world by myself, yeah, oh it's very easy i sleep well every night i can sleep any time i sleep very well, um, a little sad but most of the time i'm very happy i'm just not happy with where i am in my life right now, um, not really i really i try to think very positive and try to do whatever i can every day to look for work and, just stay positive and focused, no i haven't, no i haven't, um the last time i felt very happy was when i graduated from um college i felt very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and, that was the last time i was really really very happy like that, i felt like i was on top of the world i felt like, just, overwhelmed with joy just, everything was just so exciting for me that day i was just very very happy nothing could make me upset that day i was very happy and when i think about that day it just, it's a very happy experience for me, um, right now i don't have <ha> really have a best friend, i really try to i'm, i tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of positive choices so right now i'm just like, um, i really don't have any friends right now, um my personality, um, i'm, a happy person i'm a outgoing person, and, a positive person, and, a good mother, um insecurities like um sometimes i feel like, um i have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something i feel like i can't get through something i can't, get to the next step sometimes or, just, feeling down, sometimes, well i did have a friend and she was like bipolar, and i tried to really be her friend no matter um the disease she had, but, she wasn't a really good friend because she, one day she start, just, um, being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and, it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely, yeah just being friends with certain people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just, don't it just when i notice things about people that should determine whether i wanna be their friend or not you know they might have, bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that that's a red flag and i shouldn't be these, people friends <laughter>, yeah, um to stay in school, stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people, and just, stay on the right track, well i went, um to a friend's house that i haven't seen since childhood, and they, it was just a lot of people over there, and they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed seeing my old friends that i didn't see in a long time, and just being with, my family and, certain friends i really enjoyed because i'm really always in the house i really don't go out that often, so just i enjoyed being with, a group of friends and family and having a good time, yeah, um i'm proud, that, i did get my g_e_d i did graduate, and i do wanna be somebody and i'm very proud that i wanna be a better parent than my parents, thank you <laughter>, goodbye",3
462,"<sync>, yeah, i'm okay, uh i'm from los angeles, mhm, oh um the weather <laughter> the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid backness the, driving instead of public transportation, and the sporty, um, i really, i don't know the lack of um, uh uh mm, i don't know there's not a lot i don't like about l_a as compared to most cities i really, it's my favorite and i've lived around the world i love it i love l_a, a lot, <laughter>, yes i've lived, in paris and i've been around the world a lot, um uh it's just um it's, fun and it's it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to, get to um, get to experience all the, fantastic um sights and and, <ss> and cultures, um uh well i mean um uh, i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i, i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for, spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um, and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um, there's a grind there you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then, i mean i still um, i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really, a sucker for that kind of stuff, um, i guess madagascar, was pretty much like just, really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and, it was like you were seeing a lot of, uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might've been lying, um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah, um i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education, degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to, just to get the um, just to get the stipend i didn't really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do, i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um, the way the school system goes right now it um it just it, it turns people into, into um just um, just uh dog eat dog um you know i i don't like the way, the people <peo> it i think it's so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that, that would be my dream job that so i'm excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work, with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal, um you know uh trajectory, um, i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via, any sort of um, legislation, except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know, facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways, i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so, i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system, uh i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think, um, i don't know actually i'm kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa so you don't know, <laughter> yeah, yeah, yeah that's cool, um, i definitely um, uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so, a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot, so that's, quite soothing i try not to do i don't really do anything that's too, tense unless it's time for it like time to drive to a job or time to, you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise, um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and, but you know and i, i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer's coming so i'm gonna swim some more too, um when i'm truly outraged uh it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of, bad parts right now 'cause it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child so, there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam, a little bit but usually pretty much there's always um, you know someone, in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so, usually some kind of sanity can prevail, oh well i mean these are times where i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out, you know um sabotaged or or definitely just, when uh what's the last specific time well i, you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um, the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of, i mean she's pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her, i felt like um, i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt, in a way, good because, i get it, you know which is as opposed to not getting it, which is, even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank, of, the thing to get to to where, you can be a little more constructive about it it's like, you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty, but so i mean i don't <do> i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel, there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because, there are people that will try to use that against you that's all, but i never really feel bad for, being angry about what i'm angry about, well when i was pregnant i wish i had um, like i said um i i went through um, such an awakening about realizing when i was being, sort of um undermined that um, that demanding my respect became a huge issue and, when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place 'cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where, um i was set to be when the child arrived that i, stormed out, via what was a good survival mode before but, left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid, so, yeah, it's fucked up, yeah, i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and, cohesive, i don't, and integrated i don't wanna erase anything from my memory, um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong, <laughter>, um yeah i'm uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to, sign um, sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and i should've said no let's just go straight to court because the, there is nothing wrong with me i just, happen to, succumb to an s_s_i check via bullshit with my mother and i should've just, been you know, um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out, overcautiousness, it's, horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality, intrigue and sabotage it's bad, it's okay, someone that i mean, there's been um, you know there's been some, some great people uh again from afar i have not sort of, really um, achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that right right right <r> right now and i think that's a lot why i don't have my son but, as i've grown and developed i've seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so that's wonderful and um, but otherwise you know a constant, you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to um, get to that point, not so easy these days at all, um i'm being i've been um i'm not, completely centered and then there's been some, um actual you know, uh, people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment, and stuff like that, um, i'm still pretty pollyanna'd out i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible, i'm tired and drained and a little bit um frustrated because that i know that um, i've been sort of, that i sort of have a bit of, um my um energy and and space being usurped <u> usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and past it, no, no, um, there are i'm i'm i'm basically very very very happy pretty much, blissed out person but, um this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that, it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realized i was such a happy person, are thrown there again so i'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but, you know um during the day i'll i'll i'll i'll think something completely true and organic and i i'll just stare at something and go wow that's beautiful and i'll be reminded that i'm, pretty close to my spirit so, um, i try to stay there twenty four seven i'm pretty spiritual that way, um uh, uh, fun i mean if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there um, that you know that i'm this is off you guys, that i'm funny and that um, and that um, i think that's bad um that i'm funny and that i'm good and that that i'm trustworthy, um, just uh i'm i'm i not necessarily change but grow through um my ability to connect with the people i wanna connect with, and disconnect from the people that, manage to, to, drain me, i already said i regret the thing with um, leaving the place where i could've delivered my son even though i was being, um uh sort of, abused, get the fuck away from your mother <laughter>, sorry um you know and like a lot of the <th> um, and and, yeah and to open

444,", yeah, i'm fine., i'm fine today., i feel good today, uh born in indiana, mhm, grew up in bloomington, i moved to l a for a job that works with the c d c, i've only been back twice in the last twenty years, my family's gone, uh i went back for high school reunions, it's much greener it's very green uh very small, um, uh, very., forest areas where i played in the woods when i was a child, we floated in the quarries., i've been riding my bike everywhere., and here it's a little bit around, more uh, cement and transport, um, it was <wa> it just seemed, like cement at first, but i love it now and i have friends and i love, be able to do so many different things, and i go a lot to the beach, um, i'm still going to the mountains i'm going camping all the time, so i love it i love it, always opportunities, < slaughter>, i've travelled a little bit, i've been to the peace corps., and i was around <tisk> in south america, i was in paraguay for three years and traveled through south america, brazil peru uh peru chile bolivia, i also spent a year in london., travelled all over europe, and i've often gone to canada, i'd like to come to asia on one of those days., uh meet new people the food i love to try out new food, to and just get a different perspective, on the world, and the prospects of the different people in the world, and because america tends to be isolated, i wandered the incaweg, when i was in, uh peru, and that was a five day hike, start from the cusco, we climbed for four or five days., ahem and woke up, on the last morning, at the sungate of machu picchu, and that was just a very amazing experience, because i would only see that i had seen it in national geographic, you know my whole life, to be there like that, and experience that was phenomenal, philosophy, i graduated in philosophy, i working part time in art, empty the throat , good i started in business, and i was very disenchanted with him very quickly, and so i decided to study what i wanted to study, while i was in college, and had the opportunity, so that's what i wanted to do, and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher., but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree, then going to law school., and to be a professor of ethics, but this species fell apart and that's actually how i, end until joining the peace corps <laughter> so it all worked out, i'm sorry., yeah, yeah, that's good., i'm sorry my alarm goes off on my phone, it's gonna die in a second., okay, i'm sorry., it's still working., i'm sorry i turned off the phone, but i forgot to turn off the alarm., which should go, okay, what's sorry about what your question was?, my dream job, to <sigh >, oh, my god!, to write, um, i made some., uh scripts uh some squeenplays with a friend of mine, but i don't really want to do the hollywood thing., about <tisk> but writing and teaching, and travel if i could do that overseas, so, outward, should i turn off my alarm <laughter> it goes on <laughter> here oh i can't move okay i can't get to my purse, okay, i'm sorry., yeah, i turned off my phone, but i didn't turn off the alarm., it's like i forgot it was my alarm to go to yoga class., i'm terribly sorry about the <laughter> okay <laughter>, < slaughter>, sorry to interrupt, i have a real fish tank., at my home and i do the same thing and i do it with my kids when they get upset about me sitting in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing, i also try to meditate, i'm trying to sit down and be calm., to collect and my thoughts, i like to read, and by or sometimes i go or i take my dog for a walk, i wish i could say i was good at it, but usually i tend to have outbursts., from time to time, when things get too messy, at my home to, and i feel very underestimated, i'm going to.., you have a, outbursts of anger, yeah, my husband doesn't appreciate it, and i've never done it at work or in a social situation., but at home with my family i did it and then instead, to realize that i'm upset about it., my husband tends to get mad at me because he's angry., and then escalates and, uh, sometimes i just end up walking through the door, or go to my room, hmm, i'm sorry., usually, after i had an outbreak, and i isolate myself for a little, i can come back relaxed, and handling the situation, in a, more, quiet way, sometimes it's very difficult, but i've come to the point where i know just to, stop and get me out of there., and go and breathe deeply, and then really try to figure out what i feel, why i'm angry why am i, um, so tense, and then be able to verbalize that, um, good i i it happens a few times when i start getting, i had a very tense day., um, and things didn't go right., um, i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i make dinner, and the children are all at home and they ask me questions about their homework, or they turn on the t v or and my husband is uh, i'm worried about things i just don't have to think about., and once i said, okay, everybody in the kitchen let me out alone, just let me finish dinner., and no one would, and i just had more pressure to build and build, and i actually took one of the pots and just hit it against the stove <laughter> really hard to get like people, watch what i said, it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> , which is still there, so i should have done it., went out early and took my deep breaths before i did, um, it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child., i wasn't married., i had a very good friend., um, oh i was i was, thirty two at the time, so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger, i'd probably have decided to do an abortion, but at this point in my life i'm fine, i'll have that, um, and i had, um, i got pregnant by the man i was married to and still married to., um, but we were only together for three months., and i lived with, a good friend of mine, who i share in the peace corps, um, and she and so i didn't know this guy very well, i didn't know if we could raise a child together., i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with someone else., um, and my friend suggested that we raise the child together., to even suggest moving to costarica to raise the child together, um, and so it was a lot of, um, large decisions, who would determine the rest of my life, um, and i, the decision based on , more common sense and practice, um, but i don't regret this decision, i think i made a good decision., to marry my husband and, raising our child <laughter>, they're older, now my eldest is seventeen., he is around <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he is very specialized in engineering, he gets his pilot's license, i'm very proud of him., then my daughter is, 15 years, and she loves acting, she has a boyfriend., who's that?, uh they see only once a week in the church basically, and they keep texting themselves, she's a very typical 15 year old., and then i got a twelve year old, he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and always makes noises, but i love him very much, he likes climbing and there is a climbing hall near our house., so he has a membership there, so he goes over there and climbs almost daily, no, i find it extremely difficult that i wasn't., my mother had a very difficult <d> my father died when i was young, and around my mother somehow separated, when that happened, so i had no very warm or loving, relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically grew up i was, from a very young age on your own, um, i mean, she was in the house, but.., had really no interaction with her, so i really didn't have, parental skills, you know that most people will be brought with you., um, i know what i'm not supposed to do, but sometimes it's very difficult and, i see my friends you know., very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they make cookies and everything is biological and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect, and it's like i'm not that person., , i'm trying to be, i'm i think i'm a very good mother, but i'm not.., a typical mother, i think i'm more, i'm more creative., many times me and we do a lot of things, but it's not a warm, cozy thing., when we camp, it's more, i'm more habitable when i go camping than i am at home, i think i'm more tense when i'm home, but i try to like through meditation and things of this kind that i try to become, calmer and more patient, i think my patience is what, i have to work the most, i've been a sleepless person all my life., i remember when a child was lying in my bed watching the stars walk through my bedroom window and, i haven't slept well in a long time, but i realize that when i do sports, and i do something intellectually with my brain during the day, i must be physically tired and intellectually tired, sleep well, and that's hard to do sometimes., and so many times i stay awake and read, i'll read until midnight., and then i try to sleep., usually i won't get up again, even if i wake up at three., and such things, but i will try to sleep again, yesterday i didn't feel as good as i was, i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday, because i planned to work on my garden., and then i build a butterfly garden in my front yard., so i had to plant something., and i just couldn't feel like i was doing it, i wasted a lot of time yesterday, but today i feel really good., so i feel more positive i feel more energy, so, no, no, um, i don't know that i just got a new mattress., didn't really help me sleep, but.., it was really good because i needed one for a really long time, and it was just kind of excited to be delivered <deli> it delivered and furnished and that sounds like some kind of secular, but it was, you know exactly how, i'm finally doing something positive, because it's, it's something i postpone to do and postpone to do and postpone to do, and it was like finally, uh, there and concrete, and it's like it's okay that i've done this job, that i can check my list., but also i have the children camp over spring break and, we just had a fabulous time and we sat around and told stories and around the campfire and made s'mores and such things and these kind of times make me very happy, <laughter> i don't know about, i think she's.., believes that i, uh, uh, more intellectual and smarter than i think i am, sometimes she comes to me with a lot of problems., uh, she always asks her advice from me she thinks i'm giving her good advice, and if she doesn't know what to do, she'll ask me., and sometimes she just calls me to run things., uh or just like to complain because i'm compassionate, um or empathetic, and, i'm just here to listen., and i don't need to give her any advice., i think a good listener and, good advice donors, i delay a lot, i start projects and i don't end them., i'm working on a lot of projects that i've started in the last few months, many of them are really creative projects and, i'm very excited about them when i start them and i will, almost finished, and then, i don't know what's happening, i'm just losing interest., um, sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to end it, that sounds a little strange, but, um, i'm working on it., i'm trying to take care of them., oh, my god, oh, do not follow through on the odds that i had when, i came out of peace <p> peace corps there were a lot of things i could go in i would have gone to get my master's degree, um, with a scholarship and such things, but instead i got pregnant and married, and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed, but the second time i got pregnant, it was right., where i had to fight for a management, and i realized my limits where i could not be pregnant and have this child and did everything i had to do to get a directorate, and so i really wish, so that i resigned, um, and i wish i had held on to it, um, because then i would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and, solid career, um, not, base decisions on emotions sometimes i around and not i have had some really bad bosses, the jobs were wonderful., um, but, my ego got in the way, and i would've told myself to let go of this aspect of the job,, the, selfish, reactions i've had, to the bosses and focus on the work and do that really good, about my children actually, um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal, ahem and, uh people are really interested and they were like awe that, you know someone who really did this so i'd always be when i was a little girl., my neighbor was one of the first people to go to the peace corps when it started., and i've always said oh i want this one day i want this one day i want to do this one day, and then finally i came to the point where i had to either shut up or do it, so this is, that was, one of my proud, experience, all right., thank you., see you.",7
379,"yes, i'm feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good, i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there, and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county, about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm twenty three now so, it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've been living there yeah, some things that that i really like i would have to say you know, the beach, um you know, not so much the traffic don't really care for that but um, definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know, just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah, right, yep, yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot, i've been to places like hawaii, been to the caribbean, i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth>, um you know just different places like, arizona i've been to oregon washington, pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so, yep <clears throat>, um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture, um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery, it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say, something that you know people haven't seen before so, well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time, new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands, we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu, uh maui you know places like that so, yep, um you know i would have to say that, um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor, just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so, yeah, i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester, so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months, yep, well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college, and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting, but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me, so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but, you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know, kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories, i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so, yep, my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine, so, my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still, like i said i'm twenty three years old, um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but, for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so, things are uh you know, getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well, you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle, you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back, other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but, you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before, so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know, i can either be talk very talkative, or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and, so, um you know usually um, i would listen to music, or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive, or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know, ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy, so, you know i've actually been better with that, um couple years back you know i, there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just, pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but, you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing, and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat>, well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but, you know it's it's always something so miniscule that, that's why i probably don't remember it, but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that, you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances, yeah, something that i feel guilty about, um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing, but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice, hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent, kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got, diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough, and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be, so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies, he could be a little you know, crazy, so, probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah, yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back, been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old, so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to, i don't i don't you know, try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah, my best friend, <laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy, usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too, um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny, um i like to hang out you know just, kinda, do things here and there you know just, normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah, <clears throat, you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep, i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know, my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough, so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part, i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat>, lately eh, been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up, i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago, for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that, um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good, and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat>, yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but, you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part, i have not, no, nope, no, last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still, still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave, so you know we were just hanging out, um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so, i felt great you know it, because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything, can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like, that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so, yeah, yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret, um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about, three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time, you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances, that took place, so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it, but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said, it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way, well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if, i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just, be careful you know, make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be, um, basically you know just always be nice be honest, um just be caring toward others so, um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing, i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so, yeah, my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends, um either you know we hang out in the day, you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers, um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so, some things that i wish i could change, um, probably just you know be nicer like i said before, um, maybe not being as lazy have more determination, i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life, but i know there are times when i i kinda, get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so, um well you know it's it's tough to think back, but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know, i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have, i was trying to give more constructive criticism but, at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and, they were out of character so, my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined, i'm very caring now, more than i used to be, very honest, and you know i i just i love to talk to people, like i like making new relationships, i like making people laugh <clears throat>, something that i did recently that i really enjoyed, um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two, and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so, i feel accomplished about that, you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there, you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that, so, makes me feel good yep, um you know just let's see eh few different stories eh just, usually things about well the the paper's in long beach so it's usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah, i would say that i'm most proud of you know graduating, high school about to graduate college, hopefully you know obviously i'm gonna earn a degree and then hopefully get a you know a good solid job, you know in the near future, i think that's one thing that i'm most proud of, thank you",2
353,"yes , i'm okay , um pennsylvania , mhm, um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life, um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once, a year, um, definitely safer and um definitely a more um, well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here, um , not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment , no, um advertising communications , um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment, um i wanna be an osteopathic physician , um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who, helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live , a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine , um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast , um sometimes , um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and, eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups, um, eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings , um i usually , try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated , um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset , um <sigh> let's see, uh mm, i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case , yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers , i have no idea <laughter> , um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um, i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people, um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em , no, yes , um just a few months ago about in the last six months , um i was, experiencing , mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't , um, i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself , um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um , that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working , um , i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so, um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings, and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out, um, well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um , and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and, i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that , i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home , um , it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um, i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling , i do , um <sigh>, well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um, and i am more, cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts, um, and about my decisions as well, i'm not so, i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life , um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours, but now i am um sleeping through the night again , um i feel <f> groggy <sigh>, k i feel foggy and out of it um , and just low kind of depressed , mm, <sigh> it's um, i think it's been awhile , um, working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um, spending time with my family, um, yeah just being outside enjoying nature, reading, um very close , what is that , um, , um, well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um, giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then , my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um , looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend with this um incident that happened um, he's been very, uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and, and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or, um running errands without having a lot of anxiety , um i'm most proud of , the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um , maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it, going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut , um , what advice would i what, uh, to, recklessly pursue your dreams um, that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and, and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted , um , let's see, uh <sigh>, well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um , so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so, we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis, and cauliflower so just using preparing that, for <f> um, for my um boyfriend and i , mhm, bye thanks",11

years., <laughter> uh not even close to uh, more setback uh out here it's you know you have the weather, that's the prominent <pr> prominent reason for coming is the weather, it does uh good maybe better chances, uh and the weather <laughter>, yes, it took one minute uh to get to <tisk> the uh, different attitudes of the people, the environment, the locations and the, wide area that someone had to cover to get to one place, um, all right., the weather uh for one that never end uh uh it never snows in southern california, umm two uh, the prospects of uh uh starting a business or becoming uh, self employed and self employed, do what i like to do, the people, they're not friendly for no one friendly out here you know uh back east and i'm from uh i was raised in the south, where everyone is uh warm friendly hello when you pass in the streets out here, people think that you uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing, so, i don't like that about l a., previous uh i was on the road a lot i was a truck driver and plus uh an entertainment uh bus driver for several, uh motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yes, well, that's a beautiful land, so it's just a beautiful land., see uh uh the landscape uh visit different cities different cultures, uh different cities uh and see how, basically like the rest of the country uh lives, a few not so good a few bad uh and a few good uh times see, denver colorado, i lived in denver for a few years that uh really is a great uh, city, uh, and then i lived in uh atlanta, which is uh uh really a great state where you know that you have the southern attitude <a> a southern attitude southern attitude, that is friendly to everyone and comes out and, and, let's see., i was at least back and forth in this country., 16 to 20 times, yeah, it was like it was an adventure., < slaughter>, uh arkansas, small stone, where i had to get into a uh, you could say a dispute, with the hounds down there because, as you know,, i'm african american, and down there, they're very biased that you know they're the.., southern, uh, what the rebels were uh no rebels, but uh, what were they, uh confederates, they still have this tendency to think blacks?, or any other culture except white are not uh, valuable people, yeah, so i had an incident down there where it actually turned into a shootout., but i'm fine., a little of both depends on the time, on the time it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know, i can go because i like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and, i know how i said i uh i had some conversation before so, at clubs i am more outgoing, shyer in social events, < slaughter>, meditate, very good, very good, because, if i let my temper get the best of me, i tend to, cause more, damage, as good, you know that the person harms me by, you know, uh, physical conflicts or to go to prison, and so yes, i'm very good in uh, control my feelings, my temperament, good question, uh, okay girlfriend <laughter> uh, we recently split up about two three weeks ago., because of a dispute about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do, and she still wanted to do it like this, uh that led to a dispute and the argument ended up in us so yeah, it was emotional uh, but, i'm fifty five and it's not my first break up so, i'll just take it in step and move on, uh, well, it's probably that it, no one can really be no situation, i feel at the time when you when you are having a situation at any given time there is probably always a better way to handle it, after the fact, but.., i'd say back in the 1980s, when i and my wife broke up., i think i could have done better because i was younger, hot tempered., and more irrational so that i could have treated you better yes, what the way i broke the way i treated this situation, well as i said uh young and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and, uh, unable to communicate, with another person at the level of, of, understanding, < slaughter>, hmm, leaving home, well, it was like, <sigh>, what can i say?, it was about, one o'clock two o'clock in the morning, and i've just decided to pack and go without letting anyone know that i'm going, it was like one of the toughest decisions i had to make, sketching, loving but sketchy uh, my family is in detroit and atlanta georgia, i'm in california, i don't have anybody out here, so.., i'm basically on my own and i've been on my own for a long time., we're reconciled., and we talk and send, christmas cards thanksgiving cards you know and in this factor but uh as far as uh, family it is, it's, it's sketchy., nan, hm, uh, i don't know., most things i don't want to remember i don't like and i've deleted, many things from my memory or, i put it in a closet that i can't open to remember., but most of what i can say is uh uh, i'm not going to go into detail, but an incident where, it caused great physical damage to a person, in the last two weeks uh with which i had uh, this hearburn problem, so it's been really difficult in the last two weeks., for me to get uh, a little sleep, because i have one in my pocket, now i have a glass of tums, it keeps me pretty stunned right now, irritable, um, scary, um, need to do things, uh, and, i feel like i have people., and things that, against me and try to block everything i do to be successful and that was a big disturbance for me, yeah, but you know, like i said, i'll take everything with a grain of salt., and i keep pushing, because, you can't stay angry., or vengeful to a person or a thing too long because it achieves nothing, so i must push further, no, basically i'm still the same, just keep my thoughts <th> uh i keep my ideas that i have to do, uh and try to achieve uh uh what i need to achieve uh uh, post mm traumatic load, uh no uh uh, yes, uh, back in uh, oh nine, two thousand nine, um, weeping, much, uh, do not trust, uh mistrust of other people, so, what's going on?, uh, and i was recommended uh, uh and related to a medical uh, um, um.., mental health uh institution, for treatment, from time to time, if i feel depressed and fear builds up in me uh yes, i still have treatment, yes, because i have the chance to express some of the things that, i don't usually express, and i can like, blow off steam or uh, blow off, the fear part of uh my depression, hmm, i don't know if i'm really happy., oh, if uh, well, i was really very happy when, my uh the girl i just broke up with, came from the highlands, to be together for us, i was really happy, and then it turned within two weeks, but at that time, when that happened, i was really happy, funny, um, <laughter> funny, for informative <inf>, informational, um, for the benefit of the social partners., uh, i, basically, everyone says i need to be a consultant because i'm very, illuminated in many life problems so uh, my friends would describe me as helpful, likely, education more education, do not raise my sons, all right., my son, my sons were young when i and my wife broke up., out here and she moved and remarried and, she has the boys with her and, they took the name of the new man, and i wasn't able to raise her like i wanted to raise her., patience more patience, be more, accepted from other ideas and opinions of other people, hmm, there's nothing., basically at home, i'm watching movies, i'm a loner, my sons, you're welcome., see you later., i press the button now, why aren't you married?",6
306,"beautiful, uh colorado, mhm, career, career opportunities, uh unlawful, uh for training for the weather, for a friend, not often at all now, every few years, oh the weather uh the beach sunsets on the beach, uh the thought of uh career opportunities, um, an educated group of people demanding market, it's an adaptation uh to come here many people misjudge it a little it's a relaxed appearing city, but it's actually very much to know uh sensitive to you, uh success and commercialization and this kind of thing, so you have to keep the pace, this is a bit more difficult, i think if you make the adjustment first, and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market where you just have to work hard as you do it in others, oh, be a lawyer., mhm, oh just because you have the power you can use oh you know skills to be able to affect people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being an assistant in this area, oh uh a lot of it is no longer around just brothers and sisters from the state so not particularly close now, dishonesty, lack of sympathy, uh insensitivity you know, very good., when i'm something, regressively so laughter , mhm, oh wow uh, oh just a friend a friend who's just a, has a fabulous job is uh spend too much money he needs to save, uh by means of a work situation only one work connection, together friends mhm, ah close close now we spend time we got uh we go and have fun sometimes, uh walk walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach area is a kind of fun rodeo ride occasionally, and uh and watch movies, art galleries, oh uh my daughter, i only have one daughter who graduated from u c l a law school and uh i raised her all alone without any help, so it seemed like an achievement that was worth the two jobs and the work was, i think it's difficult, i think it's a difficult job that requires a lot more work than most people give him credit for if you want to do it right, you know, it's always second guess of your behavior and this kind of thing, i'd say group pressure., it can change everything a parent has tried to put in a child that is good, , so this was a really bad time for us, to i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you are in, or the uh, i think they are a little misguided i think a little uninspired unin uninspired at the moment, i think they're burdened by the worries of the wars and so on, and i think they can probably get a, uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as opposition to only more separate group than a family fam once they were i think, you know how uninspired at the moment, i worry sometimes because you know problems with work, but it's pretty easy., no, i don't feel like i'm not sleeping, i just know you know i'm gonna worry about something at work occasionally., oh, god, a few weeks ago., oh just uh you know, unfortunately we need to worry you know that i'm lucky, that's not easier it's just the collaboration between people uh it solves most of everything you know so you always want that around you, only stressed, yeah emphasizes more, mhm, to yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not how you feel or misjudge things that you might judge differently if you were better rested, uh not depression, um probably yeah i was that as a possibility i had an employment lawsuit a few years ago and uh actually sued it and won the settlement around something about whistleblower thing implications in implications of that and around and i was somehow bothered about it and so i found when i came out of it i couldn't immediately find work in my own area, so i had to go back to u c l a and a new uh professional direction and, i sometimes felt scared that it would happen again, you know, and you think that would never happen again, you know., to just that i noticed that i noticed that i felt very uh in my legal class, i had a section on labor law, and there was a very complicated file that i had done with a lot of work and study for my case, but once faced with it again in this class setting i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized that i was traumatized by having to go through that again to know that yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down, from what i understand and so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i had to get the paper back and wow you know no adrenaline just wow, there is a xx, back back, just uh just extreme uh you know, avoiding something to do, that should have been easy for me, and uh and think about it as thoroughly as i should have studied it or deport it uh the feeling of going through the paper, this kind of paper, even if there was only one class assignment again, you know, well, not lately, you know for sure when what happened about ten years ago, now it was decided in court about seven years ago., and yes, it was effective, you know, it was effective in the way you see most everything and in your trust and this kind of thing, i'm sorry i repeated the question., i feel peaceful, yes, i was peaceful that it is, but angry that it has ever happened., so it's hard, i'll probably never feel peaceful about this topic ever it always, the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through the yeah, i don't think i've tried anything to avoid it., i think that was also an aggravation for me because i'm a patient person, realistic and around and i tried everything to avoid confrontations in the matter, but it was only necessary to try, you know, help me cover the damage to my daughter's life, i don't now maybe once in my life not now you, if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you overcome the perceptions of people or their judgments of you if you can, effectively explain something and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself, that others usually have judgments about age or something like that, um, well just raise a daughter you know or uh, they know only to the experience of thinking that this was one after all the years that was a success was their graduation from the legal school, yeah, that's good., i'm just.., like a lot of work had a good end, uh you know happy that it fulfilled wishes or dreams for this child have been fulfilled, you know that and she was able to make this success, wow for laughter , i tend to be happy with life, because the alternative will do harm, that you know your ability is successful., so i'm trying to force luck i think in most situation in my life route i find something about it, uh, when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy, i travel a little locally i traveled more than i was younger i really enjoyed, but only too busy in recent years, only new places to take the ability to take care of the worries we have every day work, or worry and somehow see them away for a while and something new, you know the way, i go back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale and uh and spent the night there and around and it was only in spring when there were not many skiers and it was just nice and very quiet, many restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was nice, yeah, that's good., wow uh, only, i work hard loyally., to be creative, to just see something you're creating, you're trying to create, something you hoped the picture would know if that was the case., you know, just hard work uh just met or presented yourself in a certain way that you know that it makes you happy, to my daughter around very ver pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she sends me pictures all the time, all right., see you.",0

for that was my reason for going home, prior, uh there's really not a comparison, you know this is warm and, sunny, and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment, i it took a minute, to get adjusted to the different culture, but uh after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here, uh i love the weather, i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains, and um so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here, uh i, tend to not have things that i don't like, uh because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there, so and i like me so that means that there's really nothing i don't like, yes i do, uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences, and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between, uh all types of people, it's a very rich experience, um, which one, to where, uh i, guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there, uh as i go, the people and the, warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue, through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that, there are so many there really are, but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque, which was just really pure and it, really stayed with me how similar, we actually all are, um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips, uh there, and, let's see, just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too, wow i've studied lots of different things i've studied law i've studied um, entertainment i've studied communications i've studied, whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman, <laughter>, <laughter>, ah it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy, keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive, and um just allows me to be able to, be fully developed as a human being being able to do that, mhm, um, i don't have a dream job, per se, what i do have is a um, desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose, on a daily basis so, uh probably more outgoing, mhm, <laughter>, well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform, before i move uh around i get exercise, so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving, and uh then move forward from there, uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have one anymore, argued, um, cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument, um, don't know what it's about, i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money, situation i wish i had handled differently, you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets, to hold guilt about the way anything, uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences, uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as, needing them to be different i need to learn from them, or to um just really accept what is, mhm, hardest decision i've ever had to make, um, don't really have a quote on quote hard, decision you know because i grew up in a way, uh where my mother was extremely, wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life, and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say, it's your life, and so, um for me decisions don't really come, as difficult to make, they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood, so i don't really have a, most difficult, decision i've ever made, mm, event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to, erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase, uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow i'm out, uh, great uh a little more, uh, physical exertion than normal , but uh still great, <laughter>, mm no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to, the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty, even tempered, no, mm, no, uh that's pretty much every day, <laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm thankful i'm grateful, for my life and uh i'm just thankful for everything that comes into it, uh, very smart uh, very loving uh very intelligent, funny, uh outgoing, that's probably probably what my friends would say, uh there's really nothing that i think i need, <laughter> to to do or to have or to be different uh about myself, like i'm okay with everything the way it is, really am, <laughter>, what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago, to know, um, to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago, was important in terms of developing the person that i am now, and, so to just, be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to, learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up, recently really enjoyed, uh, uh cooked a very wonderful meal, um 'cause i love cooking, so that was something i really enjoyed, mhm, wow my my willingness to get to know myself, through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application, of everything that i've learned about people cultures, places and most importantly, you know, the god within me, bye",1

379,"yes, i feel okay little tired but for the most part feels pretty good, i'm actually originally from forest hills that i was born in the san fernando valley, and then i moved to lomita, which is in loose circle, ca. mm probably by nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm now twenty three so, it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've lived there yeah, some things i really like, i'd have to say, you know,, the beach, you know., not so much traffic doesn't really care about it, but it does., in any case, you know exactly how the nightlife is., just people in general i like talking to others so yeah, right, yep, yeah, actually, i mean, i can't see your shoes, but, um, actually, i travel a lot, i was in places like hawaii., was on the caribbean, i was seeing at uh times <machte sound with mouth>, you only know different places like, arizona, i was in oregon washton., pretty everywhere i would say so but usually especially as to hawaii and the caribbean mexico so, yep <free throat>, i think it's just the experience you know as if you couldn't experience culture., to different people you only know the whole background of the landscape, it's just that you know it's something new to experience, i'd say, something you know that people haven't seen yet, so, well, let's see, i recently made a trip to hawaii a few months ago, which was back in december it was christmas time, new years so that was pretty fun we went to a few different islands, we went to uh see, i think it was kauai going to oahu, uh maui you know places like this so, yep, you know i'd have to say that, around you probably know like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know, just like i said before the whole experience factor, just look around you know new different things things that are unique so, yeah, that's good., i'm studying journalism right now, i'm in my last semester, so i'm over <bout> until graduation couple of months, yep, well, you know, it's kind of funny because you know that i started a two year community college at a.. you know., and so you know, i went into uh like business management know something to do with you, i think, < thin> basically about accounting, but i thought it wasn't for me., so i decided to go into journalism because i couldn't say that i would probably still be sitting at a desk, but, you know, at least with journalism, i can go to the field and you know, talk to people, and you know,, arta you know, get information collecting information that arta deal and then you know write stories, i just thought it was you know it was much more interesting to me, unlike you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so, yep, my dream job, i'd have to say you know something on the radio show., sport transmission, you know, i think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine., so, my relationship with my family it's pretty good you know i'm still living with my parents, as i said, i am twenty three years old, there are times when it can be a little shaky, a little stony, but.., for the most part, it's pretty good that you know i've matured a lot in recent years., things are, uh, you know, i'd say things are going pretty well., you know, i think it's coming somewhere in the middle, you know, sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and relaxed, other times i somehow it's not as much as i go into my bowl, but, you know sometimes how i can be kind of shy when i don't know people so well or when i've never met them before, so it's one of those things that somehow you have to meet me in the middle of it, because you know,, i can either talk very talkatively, or sometimes you know i can be a little shy, but you know, once i get this conversation started, i'm pretty talkative and, so, um, you usually know, um.., i would listen to music, or maybe you just know that you're kind of going on a ride, or you know you're hanging out with my friends, you just know something to know somehow., lightness that you know because you know how i said, sometimes you get a bit tense and you just want to relax and you know only the things you enjoy, so, you know i was really better with it., a few years ago, you know that i, there were points where i could pretty much not control my temperament, however, as <li> i mean, i would just, pretty angry at you know the smallest things that everything would just tick me off somehow, but, you know, i definitely learned, uh you know, control over this kind of thing, and you know it made me a better person because it burns my throat., well, let's see, i'm trying to think it was probably something with my family with my mother, maybe it's i can't remember from the top of my head, but, you know, it's always something so miniscule that, that's probably why i don't remember., but you know we're gonna make up for this sometime, and i apologize because you know i accept that., you know i'm wrong under certain circumstances., yeah, that's good., something i feel guilty about, maybe you know that i'm not as nice to others as i could have been in the past, you know, and that's the past, and you know, i don't like staying in this way, but i think this is one thing that i've tried to work on, but it's also one thing that i regret somehow, not just do, just be nice, the hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty new, a little hard because i actually have a buddy who was in the luftwaffe and he recently, diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia, so that was really hard, and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not quite there the way he used to be., so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm ignoring him and i don't want to do that, but at the same time i don't know his tendencies., he could be a little bit., crazy, so, maybe you know some kind of traumatic stress disorder, maybe when he was in the military, so i don't know, but yes., yeah, it's pretty hard, you know, because we've been back a long time., were best friends with him because i was probably about five six years old, so it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to handle, but you know, i'm trying to, i don't know., try to stay in mind, but you know it's always there, i don't forget, so yeah, my best friend, well, he would probably say that you know i'm a pretty pretty guy., usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest, but you know i'm trying to work on it too, he'd probably say i'm pretty funny., i like hanging out with you., mode, doing things here and there that you only know, normal activities like any other person you know going to the beach hanging out movies that you know grab a few beers that kind of deal so yeah, <freezes the throat, you know, it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know when i'm really tired, you know, i'm probably going to have a very good sleep, i haven't slept so well in the last few days, because you know,, my house, there's workers on the roof, so use the new roof, so it's kind of tough., so that wakes me always early in the morning so sometimes a little crabby, but for the most part, i usually get a pretty good sleep <empty throat>, lately eh, you've felt pretty good because you know things are starting to look up., i actually did an internship about <bout> a month ago, for you know, my field of journalism, so that's good to graduate in two months, so i'm looking forward to,, to make a little more money, you know that's good, and yes, things are going pretty well right now, i can't complain < clears throat>, yeah, it's not bad that you know how i said it could always be worse right, but, you know, i enjoy life, so it's the best part, i have not been going on, no, yes, no, last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably back to my buddy when you know that he was still, i guess you could say we know he came back to visit the air force he had left., so you know we were just hanging out, you know i have a few beers and i'm just talking about life, so it was nice, but i miss you knowing., i felt great that you know, for there is nothing like having a best friend that can be entertained, whom you can know twenty four seven above all., can tell him everything in confidence, and he could tell me everything in confidence, how, it's hard to find that you especially know someone you've known for so many years, and then you can't really get it back now., yeah, that's good., yes, there's one, there's probably one or two things i regret, well, i mean, i regret having a d u i over, three or four years ago, actually, it was four years ago, so that's something i definitely regret because you know that i look back on it and you know that things might have been different, but at the same time, you have to accept that you know the actions you know., which has taken place, so you know, i'm manned and you know, i think i think i'm better off for it, but at the same time, you know it will always be in the back of your mind, as i said., it's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way., now you know, it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a kid then, so i really don't know what to say, even though, i would have listened, who knows, but you know that i probably would have told myself that you knew exactly., be careful, you know., make sure you can be the best person you may be, um, basically you know, just always be nice honest, to take care only of others, so, to probably get back to my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing, i'm not saying that i wish i could erase it i just wish it didn't happen like this, so, yeah, that's good., my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends, either you know we're hanging out in the day, you know that certain things like you know, maybe grab a few beers, to you know you just have casual entertainment maybe play games movies look you know only the standard stuff that people do this, some things i wish i could change, um, maybe you just know you're nicer than i said before., um, maybe not to be so lazy have more determination, i mean, i have a lot of determination, i know what i want to do with my life., but i know there are times when i'm kind of, get a little laxadaisical so i wish i could improve on that and not delay so much, well, you know, it's hard to think back, but i would probably say a time when someone is making me feel really bad you know, i'd say like if i was you know kind of angry at certain people maybe just kind of chew my friends if i probably shouldn't, i have tried to make more constructive criticisms, but, at the same time i knew it was probably not my place to say these kinds of things and, they were out of character, so, my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely working hard i'm sure, i'm very caring now, more than i used to be, very honest, and you know i love talking to people, i like to make new relationships, i like to make people laugh <empty throat>, something i did recently that i really enjoyed, you know, it was probably about my internship, i was just you know i wrote a story or two., and it just felt good that you know these stories are done and eventually they're going to go to the newspaper, so, i feel that way., you know it's one of those things when you're working on something and then you see the product right there, you know it's right in your face, and you can tell yourself that you know how i did it., so, makes me feel good yep, you know, let's just see some different stories., usually things about good the newspaper is in long beach, so it's usually about you stories or events that take place in long beach, so yeah, i'd say i'm very proud that you know the degree., gymnasium about to graduate from college, hopefully you know obviously that i'm earning a degree and then hopefully you get to know a good solid job, you know in the near future, i think this is one thing i'm most proud of, thank you.",2
303,"okay, how about you?, here in california, yeah, that's good., oh, well, it's big and wide, there's a lot to do.., in order to provide employment opportunities as other countries, so pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here, traffic around perhaps the violence rate bad news, although you know that you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still need to watch it so you know, look out what's going on a daily basis, sociology i have a two year degree in liberal art, but my main subject was sociology., no, i'm actually a m t a bus operator, now that subway is constantly growing around my dream job is to move into the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervision next week so 'because they're looking to promote within the company so that the good thing is there are a lot of possibilities in the metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition fees and things of this nature, thank you., well, it's not really hard as right now it's easy if you use it now because they look to promote within so that you know so that i'm already working there, that's a good thing, so it's good to go ahead and take the classes you need that you're interested in and go on and the ladder as soon as possible, what do you mean, i'm sorry?, all right., read a long walk hot bath meditating just close my eyes sometimes, i'm pretty good because see that i run a bus operator you in situations and situations you need to stay calm and still professional at the same time, well, i look at it as if it were going with me i mean it comes with experience you know about you doing something on a continuous basis usually you'll get some somewhere down in the line you know well so i see it so that i've been driving and dealing with the public for years so it's like you might know the people treat how you want to be treated, no, i'm pretty good at it now., maybe when i was younger, you know yourself when you get older, you get smarter, you learn different things, and i'm still learning today., i'd say my family you know, my kids you know, even though you know i've had a lot of deaths around me, but that's just part of the life experience you know, you were born here, but you have to go here one day, but, my children will hold me, you know, healthy and you know, i love them and my family, thank you., no <laughter>, to give good examples that you know because you're the first teacher you know and want to be a positive good example for your children, and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home, well, um.., if you're the first teacher your kids are you see them on a daily basis when they wake up, so whatever was taught in the apartment they're looking for 'and learn every day you know if there is a home school you know people children have a tendency to do things they see you know what i mean so that you try to keep it positive 'em good morals and values and how to deal with other people regardless of race and you know different things of this nature, i have a son four and a half years old i have a daughter seven years old and i also have a twenty three year old, yes, i'm ready to be, well, my daughter's pregnant with a boy, she's got three around little girls, so i have three grandchildren and one on my way this time, which is a boy., yes, thank you very much., the most difficult thing is , now at the moment, i'm a single parent, so it makes itself difficult, you know, and, they can be expensive in times you know it depends on the situation of the person you know whether they have help or a job you know things of this nature to help the situation better, but it's hard to you know, but you i try to you know you can keep a job food in the house you know just care and support my kids the best way i can, with my children or just time, what's unforgettable to me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree, so it's kind of like yeah, it's kind of, though i know the baby of ten kids you've got, and i've always kept this in mind, although everyone's pretty much got a decent job for my whole family, but i'm the only one with a degree, so i kind of knocked on my back, as you know., you know that i'm just what i remember graduating you and my family there and supporting me., thank you., i'm glad i've achieved something you know, even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma and i had, um, i was working on my bachelor's degree, but i ended up in a bad car accident, i never went back, i got distracted and you know that i was working at the same time, but i was just like more than i needed income than to teach at that time because i was a young parent you know because i had my daughter around seventeen, so i was like i needed the money to support her, but i never went back, but i did., i feel like i'm taking a few classes now that i'm on the subway to help me pull up the ladder, so i'm starting a class next week., thank you., hm, the advice i would have given myself, that i would probably not have been a young mother at a young age and that, i probably would have done it., stay in school you don't know that the accident only distracts me and not i would have stayed in school i probably didn't have children early you know about, i would probably have stayed at school and probably had a part time job or something just i feel like, education is an excellent thing for a person who only knows and learn different things keep your mind open for learning new ideas every day, so i think this is a plus that you know in one's shoes just to be better, that they know each other through education, maybe to promote in your company or whatever the case may be, that they help you improve your career, i'm not quite sure., you learn from your mistakes you know, but at the same time you don't keep doing the same things i feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change yourself, you know like me, even though i'm going to school late, but still i'll let you know that i want to make myself better., yes, my oldest daughter, we had a fight because, only, the life she is living and the things she is going through, and i had told her that she just had to make some changes to improve her situation, and we fought because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it., hear the stuff you say, even if it's true, or, or they just know that they just don't want to hear it, that they might be going through something they don't want to hear, but we were arguing about it, but.., that just happened, you know,, i just told her it wasn't me., i'm sorry., very close, very close it's just that the situation is my daughter in her just needs to make some changes to improve her life, and i'll say,, she's.., she's kind of stubborn in her way, as you know, that i was raised to listen to your mother, you know, your mother won't tell you anything wrong, and i've told her over the years that you know different things, and it's kind of like i've been talking to a wall because she's done the opposite., and now she's sorry that you know because she's like my mother told me that you know mom that i'm doing the opposite, so i guess she's gonna have to bump her head a few times to get it, it's kind of like i told you i left it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change., it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she doesn't hear me and i'm like it's gonna take forever to change, but it's up to the individual whenever they're ready, you know what i mean, if the person gets tired of something that makes them change it, it can't be if you want to do it, but, the ball is her yard you know., i can only do so much, oh wow, i've had my days around, since i'm two little ones around me kind of like trained them to go to bed at eight o'clock because you know they have to go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's sleep because it kind of like, it's like being ready for the next day, or you know how you feel when you rest, what kind of person you're going to be on the day you know, because everyone has their days, whether it's good or bad, but that's just a part of life, and i feel like when you've had a good night's sleep, i hope you'll have a good day you know, pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving the bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job yourself when very stressful, so i feel when i'm rested it will help me, what am i so tired of lazy, you know, feel like i want to lie down probably going to sleep <laughter> the rest i need, but <laughter>, i never thought of that., all i know is that you know., because like i said, you know everyone has their moments that i've never thought of., hm, no, no, i don't really have a best friend, but a person i've been dealing with and who i've been working with, she'd probably tell you that i've bypassed a go better a lot., reliable responsible, i'm a man to man person, i get along with others you know, i'm kind of like, um, i leave a good one a good sign, whether i know you or not, if you know how, like you and i now, you know that i.., you'd probably say, oh, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know, something like that, thank you., all

436,"<synch>, yes, i'm doing fine, uh mexico, uh when i was young seven years old, i've been there like uh three or four times for vacation, well it's uh less stressful i don't know if it's because i'm on vacation but, i feel more at peace over there than here, well my uh family moved down here for a better life uh that was my parents, mm just the weather and the different things that you could do you could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains different variety of things to do, the traffic and sometimes <somet> yeah basically the traffic and yeah that's one of the main things, not that much i been to new york and uh mexico only, uh just uh seeing new places and finding new locations you know something new, like for a trip or, well i've been to uh in mexico i've been to the pyramids of uh, i forgot what's it called in mexico city, and i like you know about uh finding about my ancient culture since i'm uh uh mexican from mayan aztec so i like to see different things like that, well uh at school, well i did uh drop out but i came back and i'm trying to get back into it right now trying to learn uh graphic designs, well i started liking you know to take pictures doing different things and i like you know, uh going into business i like what the it entitles about, i wanna have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free, and don't being relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself, outgoing, well i just like to you know, be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how i feel around 'em, i like to hear music or you know, do do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind, well i'm getting better at it, you know, i , well it was like uh, two days ago it was something about uh i needed to pay a bill or something <some> something that uh i you know i had taken care of, but the person he's like more picky about it you know he's more, you know how how girls are you know they they want everything right there and then, i have it handled you know i have it everything there and they just bugging sometimes they don't give you the space, that you need to resolve something, well i felt like i was overwhelmed i already had it resolved i just was waiting for, a check you know that's not on my control but i already had made the paper proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it and it's like, you're making you know an argument you know a storm in a glass of water, it's like mhm, well, uh differently there's couple of them but not so recently because i've been more, trying to get my life together but the decisions i made before in the past, like dropping out of school and doing other different things, mm, guilty not that much because, not really, not that i could think right off the top of my head, the hardest decision, oh it's just not on top of my head right now, an event, mm well the only things that i remember is when i black out or different things like that that i don't remember, but, not nothing like a particular only when my uh brothers died and different things like that, mhm, well my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble, and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it, no i'm hispanic i you know i like to be with my family, and you know i i like to go over there to mexico too i have a half-sister and my grandpa died he was over there in mexico, so i do uh like to have a good relationship with my family, well, my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they had to do to pay the bills that's why sometimes i be like you know running around trying to get everythings done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out, it's a little hard because there eh especially here in los angeles there's a lotta, different things that you could get into that's not that positive, and it's hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff, well normally i just knock out it's not that hard it's like it takes me like half an hour or fifteen minutes but, uh sometimes i can't even wake up even with the alarm, uh they have to wake me up you know my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on it's like so, hard so you know i just knock out, i do get a little either i'm angry or i don't feel good and i'm not filled with energy, but i still have to know i know i have to do something so i still go through with it, i been well i been uh feeling good you know, been a little restless but not that much i had to do stuff so, i just you know put myself to do it no matter how i feel, no, nothing out of the ordinary, no, no, the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know going out with a, going out have some fun and you know i was drinking and just relaxing, and winding <win> winding down, mhm, my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax, but nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home, but without getting any calls or interruptions you know just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just, be with her doing the other different things, mhm, uh like an outgoing guy you know very social but at the same time i'm reserved depending how i feel with people, have to you know build trust or feel comfortable with them, oh i'm changing a lot you know like, uh my temper and different things drinking things i'm, changing a little different things so i could get more different things done, oh there's several but mostly uh, is when i'm coming from mexico that they wanna demeander you even down there it feels uh like silly because i went to a store i was regularly dressed, and i was telling 'em i wanted to buy something and then they said that, that i i wasn't belong there and i and as soon as they saw my credit card they kinda changed perspective because they saw the wells fargo logo they know i was american, but they thought it was like you know, it it was <wa> it felt me it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place and you have the money you ask for something you're gonna ask for something because you have it not just to waste <wa> kill their time, just because they saw a logo of a card, that's how they you know, it just it was ridiculous for me, no, basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school, and you know don't go you know try to control my temper and do different things because if i knew what i know now back then it'd be different, well uh i did drop out but i did uh go back to school and i you know i did get my high school, and right now i'm in the process of doing other different things so right now is uh getting my high school getting that together, and right now i'm working to another goal trying to get you know my either going back to school so it's basically <ba> basically getting back to school and finishing the high school the g_e_d, mhm, okay, you're welcome, bye",0
400,"yeah, i'm fine, um pacific grove california, um <sigh> the wholesale opportunities and uh all the stores and, anything i could ever ask for, <laughter> the uh traffic the the mood of the people

the music, uh no, uh open up a uh health practice of some sort, uh changing things in my life that uh had an impact on, myself and others for the for the benefit of health, uh when i have the opportunity, um <sigh>, buying things seeing the culture, relaxing not thinking about the city, ah well i i used to go to texas every every year uh with my dad during the summer and i always wanted to stay there and live there when i went on vacation, um most likely one of these trips to texas uh where we would go and spend time in the desert and shoot guns and ride go karts and stuff like that, <laughter> it was, uh let's see well um, my dad and i are uh, are not really talking that much and uh my mom passed away about two months ago, thanks, definitely more shy i've always been that way, uh <sigh>, eh just the personality that i've grown into but, learning how to adjust to the sensitivity and grow out of it, oh tea and um, you know eating i like to eat i mean that calms me down, uh eh, not that good when i get really upset it's usually a problem and i have to work to calm myself down and sometimes i just, don't, get on something and i don't stop, sometimes but i've learned to control it to that extent now, <laughter> yesterday, i was arguing about what sort <s> what kind of water we should be drinking, uh well a difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid, um, even though uh the other party's opinion was somewhat, misinformed, um definitely uh every day is a growing process i wish i would've handled everything differently every day which is what, um makes me grow and i, try to work toward how i would've wanted to handle things every day, little by little, um <sigh>, can't think of anyone right now, um <sigh>, i'd i'd i'd say uh not, supporting my friends as much with their, career choices, uh i'd rather not get into it <laughter>, therapy uh experts, have been really inspirational in the past two months, well uh they believe that, um the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and, this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study and, um, the sources of information that are uh that that are very good and i i think deserve respect based on, you know real research <laughter>, really easy i've uh almost got it down to a science, uh i'm tired, been feeling, better than i have in a long time, uh yeah i think it's uh due to the transition in the diet and, in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually you know, loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over, my short life time of, um, you know toxic choices with food and, drugs or whatever it would be, <deep breath> yes um less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and, more control over my, uh decisions and my wants versus what i need, that sort of thing, nope, yes to some extent, uh over five years ago, um <sigh> lack of motivation and, basically my my symptoms were, paralleling that of depression, uh loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear, of uh social situations, and uh, the main four or five, no, uh i believe i overcomed a chapter in my life that was the the doctor, um, you know taking control of my health and, experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started, juicing more and um just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with the help of uh, the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that, yes, uh i believe therapy is useful because, um <sigh> without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that, um it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that, will just uh resonate in the subconscious until you you know it has an outburst it basically, um therapy um, will help in overall health and mental, health i believe, for everybody, last night um, i made a really great vegan uh, dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and, had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot and i almost converted them <laughter>, yeah, uh i would say uh, you know trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do, like my brain likes caffeine and sugar, whereas you know my body needs uh something other than that , is an example, it's very very hard it's a daily process, um i was uh, handling money for uh a business partner and, they ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my formulas of, crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i made to the formula so, the blame was on me that i may have took money and i i automatically felt bad about that because of my, uneasy uh my uncertainty to the change of formula, um, no, twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to um, to start eating, raw fruits and vegetables every day, as calm and, um, sad maybe smart talented, um, i really enjoyed going to the uh wholesale food market in downtown los angeles, um <sigh> lots of food, uh great prices you can, eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price as going to a normal supermarket, so uh i i really get in a lot of enjoyment uh teaching people, how to uh maybe better themselves especially food-wise and what they're eating, uh eating and um, watching a really good t_v show, um, i'm insightful i can uh, i can adjust to people's uh, uh <sigh> i dunno i guess i'll skip that question for now, i'm most proud of um <sigh>, i'd say my overall situation with where i'm at right now i could've never imagined that i'd be in such a fortunate um situation",7

pretty cool, you know., i haven't been there yet, but i haven't been to my hometown yet., for ages, uh just you know i have all my family here my mother my father my cousins aunts uncle so, i've got my life here, so i'm probably, i mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know it's just my curiosity that you don't know, i guess., oh, all right., i love the people who are all nice, i love the variety you know, there are different types of, people and you know the imagination out there everything is just great, you know everyone's different, you know nobody's like him, at least on some aspects., um, and i love the landscape i love, the mountains they're beautiful., you know, good for hiking you know, take the dog know the family you know, it's nice, it's pretty active yes, uh the smog <laughter>, i don't like smog, it's just.., you know, if you keep going, you know you can see it in the air you know, or, you know everything is clear the sky is blue <laughter> but different from that, as you know and traffic <laughter> no one likes traffic i think,, yeah, that's good., yeah, but.., yeah, you know that pretty much l a is pretty nice you know it's i like it, um, well, i just studied, you know, i'm not exactly sure what i want to be, so it's just kind of knowing about you, here and there you jump through tires and so, not really, it's just that i'm still trying to find my interests, i suppose., so, my dream job hm, that's a good one., i love working with kids, so i'd say probably a child psychologist just because you know it's great., you know what's going on in the young minds, and you know how we can help kids find a better way, you know, kids make you know or help, you know, help them you know growing in a positive way i thought instead of going the wrong track, yeah, that's good., all i know is that you're helping kids., it's important that it depends on the situation i'm in, sometimes you know that i could be like super going and just like you know, and sometimes like it just i could be quite calm or something not and just make sure you know if i'm like in class or whatever, i don't really like it and there's everyone talking i just would prefer it just to, stay away from what you know, because i need something else to focus on something else you know there's a moment and time for everything i take, yeah, that's good., um, i like to kick my feet on the couch and enjoy reading a good book you know., you know, i'm going to see someone else., galaxy or universe or, situation you know it's pretty funny that you just know, you know, read and then just, feel relaxed and you know that you feel good, yeah, it's just fun i love reading, um, i'm not the best you know., you know, i'm trying my best, and i guess that's all i could do until i keep, better work at the end, but i'm not like the best, i mean, sometimes i have my outbursts you know., but you know, i guess that's all., i'm not sure haha you know, uh huh, that's a good question., in order to , i don't remember <laughter> uh let's see uh, honestly, i don't remember, maybe, uh, oh, my god., i don't know, <laughter> i sometimes i'm very passive that i just let go like things, because i mean, what's the point of making a big thing out of things, you know it so.., i don't know., i'm not i can't be honest i can't tell you that <laughter> at this moment, sure yeah probably come back to it, um, what are you doing?, well, i guess,, when i was younger, i knew i could have been a better older sister and i wasn't, and that makes me guilty for sure, you know i could have been a better sister., better role model <laughter> you know, but i'm trying to do my best now, so i'm trying to do things better., and it works <laughter>, yeah, that's good., i guess, huh?, hm, i don't know, i mean, i am the person i am because of the events that have happened in my life, so, if i delete something, it's just something from me in my present self or you know that would change and, i don't know, i'm pretty okay with the person i'm now i mean, you know, i don't think i'd change an event., you know, i'm fine with what, they know ups and downs and good and bad that happened, so, yeah, that's good., i can't see your shoes, but i don't travel much., but i'm kind of like a explorer i think i love how to explore, even the smallest things, like when i walk, i walk away and you know, i find my way up, you know it somehow, and you just do it., you know to travel, i'd like to do that, but.., i don't know, only you know., always circumstances in my life, which, you don't always know something that you know i'm marrying children you know and all that, so it's kind of the way you know it, it'd be nice, i guess you know, it'd be nice, you know, i love camping, the way you know it takes a few days out there camping and you know fishing <laughter> yeah, um, uh it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice, it was just me and he you know, and it was like nobody and it was like nice because it was just in the middle of the forest with a beautiful lake and, you know, it was really nice., it's just yeah, yeah, that's good., yes yes it was it was it was really fun it was like i'd like to do it again, you know right now., it would be great, you know, just going out there it's just i love the adventure of things and nature and just life and you know overall, yeah, that's good., uh, it's easy, but lately i haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because, i don't know, just you know that i'm lying there and i'm just trying to sleep and i'm just like ugh, but at some point i do <laugher> you know, i just like it probably need to be, position me on another side of the bed as sometimes i'm in the headboard and i'm like ah i have to go to the other side and, once i've positioned myself, i'll just go to sleep., but i have to find the right position for myself., yeah, that's good., um, i'm tired <laughter> i get tired all day, but, i'm trying to shake it off, you know, and just like that, feel like a new day you know and just try to make the day i have as big as possible, you know and then try to like it by sleeping at night, the day of <laughter> you know, so yeah, it's just, you know, it's okay, i'm trying to do the best, i think., if not, then i just go to sleep all day sucking, of course., uh no <laughter>, no, i felt good., yeah, i feel really good., you know a lot of things in my life you know that i've got a really good year so far, so i'm very happy with that you know everything is, you know how good you are, you know, yes, it is, except that i just came out of a cold and it was terrible, but, this is just nature <laughter> my immune system must work harder <laughter>, yeah, that's good., to super happy was uh, when the doctor told me i was pregnant, you know that i, really really happy about it and i was just like ah you know that was really good you know, very excited and just reading what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and, oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time < laughter> i never really like uh you know, but yeah, i've been very happy, uh, um, i don't know, i guess just myself, i, uh, you know how, you know, i could know that you're just me, and that's what you know, but i can't really, you know, say, i have certain thing i think i mean, it depends on the person who meets me, to tell me i can't really tell myself how oh i am that i am that only you know, just try to be my best and try to tell me something good for other people, tell me, or you know compliment me or what not, yeah, that's good., um, <laughter> nothing i think <laughter>, as i said, i am happy with the person i am just, and you know my mistakes or what you know, i could have every mistake people see in me, and it's okay, you know i'm okay with it., whatever it is right now, i'm not gonna do it., i can't change for other people's preferences <laughter> i only have one body and one life so yeah, yeah, that's it., uh, only my childhood with my sisters and my family, but, you know you know you're learning from it., you learn from the past and you feel like hey you know, maybe i should be a better role model that you know for my kids and so my kids could be better models so the world could only improve., um, only smile and be happy, you know, whatever hard things happen, you know you're gonna get through them someday., the only thing you can't do., i don't know you can't., you know, you know, you might know the heartache, or it's whatever,

powerful you know i'm, you know, i'm trying to be, you know, a better person every day and try to like, you know, improve yourself every day, as much as i can, you know, that would probably be something i could be super proud of., as much as i can, very hard <laughter> i won't lie about it is really hard, you know, because i can't say that you know it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good you know,, and you know it's always challenges and everything you know in your life, but, you know it only happens sometimes., you know, hard you know, and sometimes it comes easy you know, after a while you get a lot of exercise and all is how you have a great day and you haven't even tried < laughter> you know,, so yes., um, you know, loving friendly around you know adventurous i guess i don't know, i guess that's what they say <laughter> i just know you know that they like, you know, but that's what i'm at least trying to be, at least you know i'm trying to, always give a best foot forward, as much as possible you even know, sometimes, even if i'm having a hard day, i'm just like you know., you know, i just don't want to take it out on anyone or anything you know., yeah, that's good., around <laughter> my ideal weekend, usually i like to go to the park, i sit like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree, where there are shadows and how, my blanket out there has my dog and, how to read a book and you know sometimes, if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them, so that's pretty nice, you know., just sit there and just the air and the, noise, i guess because there's no silence, knowing the wind and the cars, and you know it's just great., yeah, that's good., awesome, thank you for being welcome <laughter>, see you.",0

346,"yes , i'm okay , here in los angeles , there's a lot of things to do i love the beach , um i love the i love that it's sunny all the time , um the amount of people , um , that's really about it the amount of people , just a little , i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things , um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months , um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york , um and it was extremely uh snowy and um , i didn't <didn> was in a position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small

doing things by myself , um , i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends, and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot , um , probably outgoing creative, um , talented , um fun trustworthy , um , i studied language um , and um physics , and um , math, no i'm not , i'm actually um, i'm um i'm trying to be an actress , it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager , , and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um , so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing , um so far um i just got picked up by an agent , so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult , but um , i'm hoping , hoping something it'll be fruitful , um , <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many , um , i guess my sister she's done really well , um , my boyfriend he's a , he's a very positive human being , um , but um , really i haven't had too many positive influences , um , i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything , um they're kind of judgmental , but um , other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day , um , geez, um , it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v, um and i read , a lot um , that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um , yeah it's kinda it's like i said it's really hard for me to relax , um , it isn't , um i tend to think a lot , um about the things that stress me out , um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um , yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks , um , i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh , has affected me throughout the years so um , it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt , um , or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep , but i uh <sigh>, i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me , because of stuff that've happened to me , so um , i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well , um , tired , i'm uh , i'm moody i'm very sensitive , um , i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person , um which really that's not me um , i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just , i'm just not a not a nice person to be around , um , i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um , just to keep myself involved , um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can , um by running around and and and doing things , so , um it's difficult , um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna , i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh , i make appointments to like for auditions or or um , even to do this i um i i tend to uh , just not , like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways , yes , um i've been diagnosed for two instances , um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago , and then i was diagnosed again um in august, um , the first time it was um , i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um , and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress , um , and then the second time it was a uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um , and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore , so i i figured um , i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um , not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated , yeah , it was , i no <n> do not, um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um , get out of my environment , um, and uh , and that seemed to help a lot , um , and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much , um they just , they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed , um , yeah so um , yeah , <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why , um , but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um , keeping myself busy , um , actually um , i'm kind of, a couple days ago , i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy , um but then i went back to , being you know going back to feeling miserable , so, um , well i realized , i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep , and um , i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky , um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me , and uh , you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that , and that made me really happy , um , yeah , thank you <laughter>, oh geez, um , i've had so many years of just , just bad just a lot of bad , that it there has it's been a long time , since i've been proud of anything , i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through , um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've , gotten rid of themselves a long time ago , but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um , there's gotta be a silver lining , so , um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh , i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people , and um , and truthful and i still i still have drive in me , yeah , ugh <sigh> so much um , my last marriage, um not getting out when i should have , um , and uh just, i regret a lot, <sigh>, um the any situation that would've had a red flag um , eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work, and um , no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um , i i would tell myself um to um , that it's not selfish , to let go of a bad situation , and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself , so if, had i known that then had had i known that, then i i i probably would've done better in life, so , yeah , <sigh>, um, people who um , when people are down on me for my faults , um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um , people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy, um, just anybody who picks on the little guy , um , you know people who don't care about the environment or animals, um , i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be , and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do , and uh i that makes me mad , <laughter> i vent <laughter> um , yeah i tend to vent and then uh , and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um, i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore, mm, i try not to get angry um , because i have a really bad temper, and it um , and it can get outta hand so um , what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap, um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind, and come back to it , um , it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um , it was about um , actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her , and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um , i was i was tired um i was it was late and um , i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um , and you <yo> <sigh>, it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person , um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue , mm kinda petty and stupid but , at the time it it seemed , it seemed uh , viable , um , hmm, one of my most memorable experiences , um , god <go> i've had so many um , maybe, it was um , i don't know, um , it was , probably um , graduating pharmacy school , um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing , uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent , and um , i uh , i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um , and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah , yeah , um , i'm reliable , um , i um , i'm talented , um i, i'm a good listener, um , i'm always there to help people , um , i tend to always try to do the right thing , um , sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but , um , and just , i uh , all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself, um , yeah , um , going to comedy shows , um , just um , having moments where you just laugh with people , um , sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood, uh , i don't know, probably that's about it , uh huh , okay , thank you , bye",23

yeah, that's it., <tisk> i don't know that just somehow fell into it took a course it liked and then took something more and somehow just walked down the road, no, there's not much work to do., it's kind of limited., yes, it does <laughter>, my dream job, i'd like to own, a restaurant, a nice restaurant in the bar, well, i'd like something a little higher than, most places you go to, or at least in the area i live in most places, don't seem very somehow just like a dive bar just somehow, worn run down so, something beautiful, something different, something creative, something pulsating for you know, pulls a lot, but it's probably expensive, so i don't know if it's really plausible, i'm definitely shyer, but i can go if i'm comfortable with people, but, at first i'm pretty shy, good idea, to a lot of times i, try, just, lie back and you know you're breathing deeply., just somehow purify your mind, or maybe you just see a movie listening to music is good reading a book, that's what just takes your head off, relax, i got much better at it <laughter> i had problems with it when i was younger, but i'm good i'm good at it now, i learned you shouldn't., respond immediately to situations you should, you know, think before you talk about this kind of thing, my ex girlfriend, when we broke up three months ago., um, we're relationship was just not very good, so it just went a predictable way and we were just arguing about the same old stuff and, it wasn't really a memorable argument, but it was an argument, so that's all i can think about and i haven't really seen it since, i don't know that it's nothing special, just a typical argument between two people who had been separated, frustrated, for example , yeah, i guess,, everyone sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure their way was right so try to convince someone that, you know, of your ideas or what you think is more difficult than it is because everyone is looking out for themselves somehow., <tisk> but yes, mm that's a good example right there with the girlfriend that i couldn't have reacted a little different and didn't show so much emotion, there were times in my life when i had a fight with friends or something you know., or earlier relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted as i knew i wasn't doing anything bad, but just more of uh, you know that you are more mature about it and don't know that you reveal your feelings so much, or, this kind of thing, leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen, that was a long time ago, i went to school in san diego and i, immediately wanted to come back so, i ruined our relationship, and we're still friends, and i wish i hadn't., mm, i feel that i can contribute more to my family and friends, i think i could do better, i think i'm selling myself so short, job opportunities are hard to get, but if i could find a good job, i would be much happier because i could take care of myself and others, so don't be such a burden for the people around me, it's good., it's very good., we're pretty open and i see my mom and dad and my sister pretty often, it's a good relationship, i mean, we get along well., i could mean it's not perfect, but it's good, <tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper, around probably irritable there, it's harder to do tasks, it's kind of like you're feeling weird or something because you don't have that much energy and, good, relatively good, spring time always makes everyone feel comfortable, no, not at all., never, i really mean, we feel happy every day, but it's probably been a while., around probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we had a good time so it's probably like a month and a half or so when i was really happy, i wish i were more, i guess.., firmly committed to my goals and i wish i would have driven better to be successful i don't know that i usually settle for less, so, i don't know., i guess that's.., the quiet behavior part of me that is good and bad <laughter>, anyway, i'm alive right now, and then you realize that five ten years have passed and you should have done something., i'll just stick with it., fighting with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she felt pretty bad about me <laughter>, um, i, i don't know when i was., when i was in high school, i got into a fight with a friend and, i drove., my car too fast and it was an area i didn't know and i hit a turn i didn't know that coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that, but, that was a long time ago, so it's not a big deal now <laughter>, stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>, <tisk>to my parents some of my close friends i have a good group of three or four friends, these were positive influences., yeah, that's good., i'm a caring guy., nice person good heart, a little, a little unmotivated must improve on certain aspects of his life, make yourself better and, passionately i appreciate passionately in a good and bad way < laughter>, well, i take care of myself very much and at the same time, sometimes it gets the best of me, mm, sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or something, you do more than, they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated, so that's an example., yeah, probably, but i can't think of anything out of my head., , focus more on the school, because while you're young, you have the ability to, multitasking, and, , mm, i don't know., really enjoyed i mean i do things every day i enjoy, but really enjoyed i don't know, i don't know, i cleaned some things out of my room, so it was nice to spill an old garbage so that it was okay, but i don't know if i really enjoyed it, but, i felt satisfied after it, mm, i think i could do better, i feel like an underachiever, so not much i don't know, i am organized very detailed, i like to finish tasks, it's very important to me that you know i'm very caring., i have good intentions in mind, i don't like to falsify people, i don't like to lie, because once you lie, one lie leads to another, so i don't like it., but yes, that's, that's it., <laughter> cool,

kinda similar but the weather is not the same so gotta love l_a for the weather, <tisk> family i was a child, it took a little adjustment but not hard, um the weather, um, i can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't wanna leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't wanna leave, traffic <laughter>, not really but i've traveled <tra> traveled a little bit yeah, seeing new places different people the way they live their lives, <tisk> um i went to monterey california earlier, last <la> or the middle of last year that was very nice, um, it's a good question, i'm not really sure, uh there's probably, i can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think uh it's kinda weird but <laughter>, astronomy, yeah it was, <tisk> i don't know just kinda fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kinda just went down that path, no, there's not much job opportunities so, it's kinda limited, yeah it does <laughter>, um my dream job, i would like to own, a restaurant, a nice a bar restaurant, well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than, most places you go to, or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of, worn out run down so, something nice something different something creative, something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd, but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible, i'm definitely more shy, but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but, initially i'm pretty shy, good idea, um a lot of times i, try to just, lay back and you know do some deep breathing, just kind of clear your mind, or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book, kinda just takes your mind away, relax, i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now, learned that you shouldn't, react immediately to situations you should, you know think before you speak that type of thing, um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago, um, we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and, wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so, i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate, frustrated, like, yeah i guess, everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that, you know, of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves, <tisk> but yeah, mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion, um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know, or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh, you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or, that type of thing, leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago, i went to school in san diego and i, immediately wanted to come back so, i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that, mm, i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i, i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so, employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others, so not be so much of a burden to people around me, it's good, it's very good, we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so, it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well, could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good, <tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper, um probably irritable there's, it's harder to do tasks, it's kind of like you feel like you're being strange or something because you don't have as much energy and, good, relatively well, spring time always makes everybody feel well, no not at all, never, <tisk> um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy <sigh> it's probably been a while, um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy, i wish i was more, i guess, stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less, so, i don't know, i i guess that's, the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad <laughter>, don't really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you should've done something, um i'm just gonna stick to that, argument with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she made me feel pretty bad <laughter>, um, i, i don't know uh when i was, when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and, i drove, my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that, but, that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now <laughter>, stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>, <tisk> um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends, that've been positive influences, yeah, mm a caring guy, nice person good heart, a little, a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to, make himself better and, uh passionate i guess passionate in a good and bad way <laughter>, well i care a lot and at the same time, sometimes it gets the best of me, mm, <tisk> sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that, you're doing more than, they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated, so that's an example, yeah probably but i can't think of anything off the top of my head, <tisk> um, focus more on school, because while you're young you have the ability to, multitask, and, , mm, <tisk> i don't know, really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i don't i don't know, um i i i cleaned up a bunch of stuff from my room so it was nice to shed some old garbage so that that was alright but i don't know if i really enjoyed that but, i felt content after it, mm, i think i could do better i feel like i'm an underachiever so not much i don't know, i'm very detail oriented organized, i like to finish tasks, um i care a lot you know i'm very caring um, i have good intentions in mind i don't like to wrong people i don't like to lie because once you lie one lie leads to another so i don't like that, but yeah that's, that's about it, <laughter> cool, right on have a good day",3

and then, after san marcos i went back to iowa for a series of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to go to angeles, < slaughter>, uh, last week, managed to go on a bike tour for cyclavia, , when <laughter> he was basically a rolling green light all the way down venice boulevard and so he made a pile like, national news and, he was everywhere, but the rest of us as his support group, riding on big bikes and things we don't, bat one eye we did not blink because this is normal for our friends who didn't even do the most absurd thing he's done lately, that was just a happy normal sunday, but, our group of friends, is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else, < slaughter>, i used to be an introverter, but definitely an extroverter in recent years, thanks los angeles, um, empty the throat , once i found the right group of friends, it was easy to be social, pulled me out to be socially extroverted as well, bombastic for the first time and it's stuck, um, if i wasn't the most relaxed guy, i'd probably do things, but if i was really stressed out, i do all kinds of things, it's.., usually i try to enroll my friends to help me make an art

of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was, not my most graceful moment, uh, i feel guilty about so much stuff., i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else, 'cause i love junk food it's really good, i have very little eating willpower because i used to be a fat guy, i don't know what the toughest decision i've ever had to make., uh made a lot of tough decisions, i guess <sigh>, it was pretty hard to leave angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty things., but, it wasn't even that hard because it urged me to do it like that., it's a tricky question, madam., uh oh you know broken collarbone, strong pain getting surgery on it all seemed as if it made sense at the time, < slaughter>, mm, no, my memories are important, i've lived a spoiled blessed life, and if i've changed something, it wouldn't be the same universe that i've lived like this universe., < slaughter>, uh, my little brother lives here, he's fantastic, he's waiting for me outside., uh, my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy, uh, but, because most of them live so far away don't really have to have too much relationship with them is positive and sparce, uh, jackrabbit has influenced me quite positively lately., she's a magical creature, uh, well, there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful, there's the part where they, managed, hit me with the best inspiration words there is the part where they, actually working on the exact things that make me excited, there's the part where she dives into and out of my life at the just right instance and then there's the part, where , she is 100 friendly and caring, all the time, all these things are really beautiful, but then when you add that and it comes with the fact that, she's doing all this, without wanting anything in return, i don't know that, <sigh> beaten <laughter>, uh, what a funny question, how do i know them, as if they were several people, how did you know?, uh, i know her through my, bicycle friends <sigh>, uh, the hard part goes to bed, but as soon as i get to sleepland, i'm pretty much there until an earthquake hits uh, so, i'm sleeping., bad, but then i'm a pro at it, so it doesn't matter, <deep breath> less verbal and that's it, my dark circles get a little bigger and i'm pretty much the same guy because i've done it most of my life, so excited that i might as well be in fire, by mm, because, the universe, in its, infinite, i suppose the word is sardinian sense of humor, uh managed to get me from the, reality, of magic, in the arthur c clark sense, nope., as a lucky man and <cough>, be vaguely conscious, it is my privilege to enjoy more time like this., uh, yeah, that's good., my excitement increases at an almost exponential rate, and i feel more and more inspired all the time, if i could only work on the motivation, i would be hired, not since you asked me on the form some time ago, no, uh, no, i thought i had it, but who knows at this point, that was a while ago., uh, i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to go angels and, started having fun mm and then the uh yeah the rest is old history, um, 20 thirteen <laughter>, uh, working on my shoes this morning was really nice, uh, an art project that all my friends, that was really nice, it's a nice feeling., < slaughter>, <sigh>, that's a very good question, i'm not really sure i'm going to ask him today., um, i guess i'm, enthusiastic, i'm, thesauric, and i'm, <sigh>, i have to say , highly analytical <laughter>, uh, it would be nice if i could get my superpowers back, that would be pretty cool., uh, how to turn on some of the fans, finely tuned and delicate machines, the chinese medicine has got me into, < slaughter>, uh, that's really hard., i think the thing i'm most proud of, would be likely, <sigh>, you know i'm not sure., < slaughter>, oh all kinds of things, but i'm working on it, empty the throat , < deep breath>, do not masturbate so much <laughter>, uh, jackrabbit, really bad word games uh and dessert, < slaughter>, no problem, see you, ellie.",3
361,"yes, i'm doing great, how about you?, i was born in u s i was born in uh orlando florida, my parents, my dad had a lot of friends in los angeles, so we decided to move here., it was quite different. i mean, the place i was before was very, very small town., you probably won't even notice it on the map, so it was a great learning experience because you know that the schools were much bigger and, different cultures and ethnicities around, so it was a unique experience, the last time i was back, it was probably five years ago., um definately different uh my aunt she lives again uh she lives in a small town, so if you want to go to a movie theater, you have to drive at least an hour or if you want to go to a mall, it's an hour's drive, so it's the complete opposite of los angeles., around the convenience all i could wish for is here around the weather is great to shop around multiple <mult> many friends here, sport around l a is like the perfect area, you know, i want to live here for the rest of my life., the big thing would probably be traffic, i mean, wherever you go, there'll be traffic, whether you're on the four to five or the one to one it's just traffic it it's it you know it can kill like two hours in your day that's huge, um yeah pretty a bit for personal and for uh for business i travel around you know usually overseas or around inland around me travel so and i enjoy it a lot, to see different places uh, different areas meet new people to eat different types of food around, when i have a day or two off, it's easy to have new experiences that enrich my life., data processing equipment, um and i also have english as well, yes, i am., i work in i t in an i t department at a semiconductor company, dream job, probably working for apple <laughter> since i own quite a lot of everything they have uh yeah, it would be great to work for apple, it is important that there are times when it is good to be alone, but for the most part i consider myself an outgoing social person., to nothing too much i guess if you kind of make a promise and you and you break it several times and i might get a little bit a bit a little uh angry, but i don't think i'd really get angry, to ask a good question, i would say i tend to eat a little more., just kind of keep my mind a little bit around but usually doesn't last that long, so i kind of tend to think like i tend to eat a little more of arta like maybe junk food or something, i think i'm pretty good i'm rarely getting angry around and when i do it, it doesn't really take long, so i think i'm pretty good, i guess i'm controlling my temper again, i really don't get angry, so it's not really a problem for me., um, i would say during the elections we talked about uh president obama and mitt romney and you know who would be the best fit for the next presidency to, this kind was a little uh i think a little heated, but it was more for uh i think more for fun than anything else, but it was an interesting conversation, um, like to eat a lot of uh movies uh play video games around, just go shopping uh play sports uh watch a laker game if i can personally, it would probably be the best to, bowling photography to do a lot, i like to do a lot of different things around and of course electronics, to i would say, starting loyally to intelligent funny, and a great listener, no, i didn't., no, no, for most nights it's pretty easy to simply avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep, except that it was pretty easy, to say a little sluggish tired around type of reaction time is a little slower, apart from that, i don't think anything too much like too bright or something, the usual is just sluggish and, not as fast as i should move, to have pretty good no complaints, not pretty much the same, i guess today i had my car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything, so that's great and i thought it would cost me, you know a little extra on the site, but you know the uh the service consultant gave it up, so i've got everything for free today so actually i'm in a really good mood, no, nothing., uh probably not saving so much money uh apart from the, nothing else is just somehow more, wisely with your money, i would probably say my best friend, he's kind of a you know, helped me out and i helped him out too, so it's a kind of great learning experience uh, you know, developing our friendship, and he saved me a couple of times that i saved him, too, so it's kind of a common thing that we're doing., you know each other, and it's, you know, it's like a good way to connect., hmm, i'd say i'm probably going back to korea to visit my relatives, they know they're a lot different than i remember., fifteen years ago, when i was a child, i was actually afraid of some of them., but now that i see them, you know they've been mitigating a lot lately and they're actually, it was a kind of learning experience for me because they know they finished an 80's when i was a child., um, i'm saying,, rate, work would be a part of it around, buying my uh the car that i wanted it took a few years to save up to buy the car, but i paid it all so i didn't pay more car payments so that's also great and you know able to help my uh family as well, hmm, um , let's see., a while recently <recen> by a few weeks i went to uh las vegas for the uh, for c s around that's great when you get into gadgets and electronics to see you all the uh the goodies coming this year, so that was uh pretty interesting to see and, to see some things that uh you know when you read on blogs they don't talk about, so you actually experience it in person from a user perspective, so i thought it was great, it's just fun being like a kid in a candy store that you can play with different gadgets, so i really enjoyed it., yeah, that's good.",0
312,"yes, how about you?, here, yes, the weather, weather mainly, yes the main weather, i'm sorry., not the people good some of the people things like that some people, okay, i'll cut you off., not as much as before, i was in school earlier and have traveled many places for conferences and such things, but i'm not in school now, but later i'll go back to school and i'll travel more, but no doubt, i don't know., i don't enjoy traveling, uh that's a good question that you're actually pretty good at i studied physics and aerospace technology, but physics mainly, yeah, i'm actually, just now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like this kind of thing and i'm going back to college hopefully that's why i'm sometimes nervous on the questionnaire, impressive, professor in a place like u s c or u c or l a or so, where the professors work three hours a week and the graduates do the rest, you're really pretty good at it., i have a lot of people., the first one i appreciate is my physics teacher in a p physics teacher in high school, although he led me to an engineer instead of a physics major. he was still a very good influence he told me., he's the first one to teach me this., school was not about a class, but about learning, all right., i'm pretty good i think, i'm single, so i don't turn into many arguments, but it's probably my brother over, he always likes to play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games, but they're actually pretty good, it's probably so and i get angry at him and him trying to defend himself, and i'm right that's all, pretty close to, i see her pretty, quite often i see parents a few times a week, they're getting older, so i helped with food things like that, and i see my brother, equal with him equal amount <amo> at the same time my sister i teach her children my nephews uh so i see her about once a week also, interesting, yes, because i spend a long time doing math and reading, and not to talk to anyone who is introverted, i guess i play video games or i learn, i learn, i think a lot, at least i'm trying to.., i roll my eyes, what i've been told is a bad thing., um, and that's it, i think., < deep breath>, poor education, basically parents are more self centered to themselves in contrast to previous generations and the children only, do what they want because the parents are not there for <fo> the parents are not parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion, <sigh>, um, i guess.., , um, , , thank you., i don't really have a best friend., introverted remembrance, i'm obviously biased., but they are, i'm really good at math, i'm not sure you can't say you can't get better than me, but the thing is, it's just that you achieve a certain confidence with it, where no matter what it is, you need to learn mathematics you can always find out it around i'm patient i think, and i'm disciplined where i can spend many hours i can spend many hours reading books that may not be important, but they might be important, so i have to do it anyway, this kind of thing, when i have a good workout, do good in video games little things like that, um, what is really happy when my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing, if it goes well, that must put me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood, thank you., right now., it is the fact that, research that i've made it this far, research wise, that's all, that's all., interesting to, when you start at school, you read about einstein and things like that it's that he's this general hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics, and, you still haven't realized that you're interested in it, but you're not sure if you're actually going to make it., and finally every step passes as a lot of time you want,, as time goes, you can get closer and closer finally make the goal finally you realize that you're just not as good as einstein, but you're up there you can add research in physics to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you don't see you doing yourself if you're a child, all right., um, a few weeks ago, when i got a good grade in a class, thank you., yes short, many years ago <ag> yes, i don't know that i always thought that i always thought that it was my dream when i was a child, that's why and i just walked so, around i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen, i was commissioned on twenty one and i was only for about a year, so i went on twenty twenty two, yes, not really, i don't think i thought it was just something that you grew up something about <abo> something that i already expected it to be, so it didn't change me that much, graduate school, in physics, no, yes, it depends on whether i really train hard the night before <bef> the day before, if training is pretty hard it's bad, but if i don't workout it i don't just know it's hard anyway, i guess moderate, thank you., yes, it's okay., i'm probably the way i am now., normal i don't think i'm so happy about everything, but still pretty okay i can still work, no, maybe something, i'm sorry., no, yes, yes i have changes in my mind, to get back to graduate school it was a while and something worried happy that it looks good, but worried that it might not be good and things like the, what do you mean, if i know this is a computer, but how hard it is to deal with these thoughts or how hard it is to go to school?, i understand, all right., i agree, no, not really., probably continue to do what you do, even if i don't believe it or not, twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yes yes it was fifteen, i think i was very happy and happy how it worked if it was a little different, i don't think it would have worked so well., although it's not perfect right now, i think i'm doing really well personally., thank you., also here, goodbye.",2
352,"yes , i'm doing pretty good <laughter> , i'm from oklahoma , mhm, yup oklahoma city , uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter>, um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter> , um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean , i studied psychology and minored in art , um no not at the moment , um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law , my dream job oh , i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um, i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter>, to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends , things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people, um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter> , when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but, i try to just, like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything , um, it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like, like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it , <sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone, it was probably with my parents um, i've been having some some car trouble lately and, i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that, i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues , i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time , oh definitely i mean, my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just , she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways , oh, probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda, um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter>, yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go, travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool , uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um, because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's, all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the, diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool , no i have not served in the military <laughter> , nope, no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've, i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah , lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep, or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me , i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function , i've been feeling really good um , over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and, that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through, a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and, so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>, um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more , positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and, of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to, kind of, just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more, confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter> , oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um , i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and, it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and, um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just, like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> , my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and, bold and fearless um, that i'm unique, and artistic, and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> , um , probably, just like, the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very, exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and, i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and, i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles , oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so, i wouldn't really change anything , oh <sigh>, i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i , should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because, um, i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just, tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do , oh , let's see that's kind of hard <laughter> , um oh i guess, i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since, i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so, um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun , cool, you're welcome , bye",10
380,"safe, i'm fine., yeah, that's good., i'm from maryland., yeah, that's good., by maryland washton d c area, uh like five weeks ago, maryland around <deep breath> it's a lot it's a lot less around, uh it's a uh it's not so nice at this time of year it's more about, it's fine, it's nice, it's.., it's much better, but there's a lot more people going on., i'm still getting used to it, so i guess i'm still getting used to it, so.., um, it's, it's not like.., yeah, i'm still getting used to it coming slowly, but i'm sure., i live in the culver city, i've got one., it's okay, i live in a really nasty house, it's cheap, it's cheap, because i live in a friend's apartment., um, and uh, but and he lets me stay there for half the price, but the actual place itself is quite terrible <horr> terrible living conditions <laughter> but i'm moving soon, so, i can't see your shoes., uh but no i travel i would say i i probably have more than most people in the u s like considering that most people don't travel to the u s, but i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything, i enjoy the chance to see others, to walks of life and how to meditate on the, the specificity of my own, they know that the < th> given the parameters i grew up under, how different everyone else is like, how every life is totally around, i also mean just within the u s like seeing someone grow in california is as different as someone growing in maryland and then thinking about someone growing up in like thailand or something it's nice it's pretty amazing, mhm, uh, okay., hmm, i'm right here ellie, um, let's see., uh, well, um.., it's been a while since i was on a trip, i guess, one of the last trips i made was to, i mean it was a like two years ago i went on road trip over the u s and that was that was pretty amazing, but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l a this is before i actually moved here, but to visit new orleans and new orleans was just this whole, like, although it's part of the u s it's like a total, it's completely different than anywhere else, it's so.., unique the culture there is so unique and the mixture of caribbean and french and all these other influences in as the american south is so, so, um.., unbelievable, yes, it's just unreal, yes, it's unreal, yes, it's unreal., hmm, it's a difficult question., one <on>um, i don't know., hmm, you know that i can give you back to this question you are able to, yeah, that's good., come back., yeah, that's good., that's what i just said., film, you know, that's actually a question i asked myself that i knew i knew., i've had my whole life like phases of interest, so when i was how very young i was really in the first phase that i remember were keys and then tools as i go around collecting keys, and then i would go around collecting tool like any kind of tool i had a toolbox my parents told me that i was a phase before that with which balls were like different balls, um, and then i was really in insects that collected insects and reptiles and so and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and, at a certain <cert> and anyway at a certain point i really got killed, like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then eventually in there i had told <to> i remeber someone that at the moment i'm interested in, playwriting and and poetry, but finally i wanted to be interested in uh film, how i could somehow see the trajectory coming, but i don't remember what led me to this conclusion i just always think, i've lived a protected life as far as movies are concerned, i didn't let my parents watch a r rated movie until i was almost like that in high school., um, and uh and i never, uh so i never saw a r rated movie i was also very zimperish as i remember when i was, pretty young maybe like six i saw star wars, the first scene in darth star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck, and so only a small scene very at the beginning and that like me freaked out and i had to leave the room so, i'm not sure., yes, it is., i don't know exactly how i got into the movie., but, i've always been fascinated by, how people interact and what you know about acting and so and movies in general, i'm just.., to be a filmmaker to direct, and uh put <pu> joined, and do <ma> as i think directly i don't use mm that word so much because it i think i think it's more than like i want the opportunity to put together and make, films, uh or making movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it because i want you to know i want to participate in all, all processes, but, i guess the best parable for that would be a director, director, it's much better if i don't live with them., um, my, i guess.., it's funny you ask ellie., i've been thinking a lot about it lately, i think i'm close to my whole family i'm closest with my father around i'm coming with my brother and sister you know how, but i don't, when they're gone, as my brother is in a foreign country at the moment, so i do not have the opportunity to talk to him, but how, i spend more time with my dad than anyone else because i feel like he's the most like, from all my family he is the one who accepts and likes me the most, thinks positively of me, so it's, i've got like a, a complicated relationship with my parents, i mean <mea> and my family in general, well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extroverter but lately <late> as moved since, but i'm not like, um, i'm not i would probably be on the scheme of the extroversion uh or on the scale of the extroversion sorry around i would be extremely introverted around, i just see other extroverts and no matter who they are, they're able to like strike talks and i'm a pretty shy person i'm kind of like, uh, or inhibited person perhaps to, so i like it, until, yeah, i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it, in the past, i'd smoke weed, but i stopped smoking weed., so now i know i have a glass of wine and, maybe you're watching a movie., um, i didn't or maybe leave as it will depending on whether it's like a when it comes to, if it's a worn out kind of stress, as if i were just like, then i'm what i do, but if it's a more like fear type stress, i could, go on a uh an intense walk not really practice that much, but i like, you know competitive sports and hiking, pretty good, well, i always like to fight around, i wouldn't call to fight to lose my temper., um, i enjoy a vicious debate around, but i don't know., as long as i want, because i don't like to go back to personal you know attacks, in my arguments i try to keep it on topic, um, and try to explain myself as well as i can, which can become frustrating because i'm not like the best articulator of what i think, um, one of my weaker points i would say, but the last time i had a heated debate, i thought that was the question., um, what happened, i forget the question that i had a heated debate, hmm, last time i had a heated debate, i had a heated debate on, uh the movie boogie nights, um, i was <wa> i didn't lose my temper exactly, but i'm going to be as extremely passionate about, 'cause i don't think it's so good in a movie, but the two people i was arguing with said that it was like one of the, how the best to get best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie, um, they think there are some who are there, as i understand it., they have a certain uh they think that the, like all the stories in boogie nights that they have their own, like each of them could have their own separate stories that they just think it's a whole like, complexity of character in film, and, that somehow like, <sigh> um, what they said, they said like the movie, it's like it's like the end of an era, that makes it like somehow like casino and there's this attention to detail of the in the different character like how they, how they interact in the action, um, something like, uh, yeah, i guess,, i think the heated debate was about like that from there and uh like myself it's not like a bad movie or something, but it's, the, i just don't think dirk diggler is like meaningful < mean> meaningful of a character like i, i think how i get out i came out of the movie because i had seen it many years ago and anyway my opinion about it is basically the same, although as i remember, when i watched it again, i could reevaluate it, there's nothing bad about the movie, there's nothing articulable like articulateable, it's like solid sound acting, you know the direction is good, the camera moves cool, um, that anyway it's really <rea> you know it's cool it's but, but it's meaningless to me it was like meaningless and then too and then there was that led us to discuss because a movie i saw recently that i really did what was django unchained, and they both saw this movie and hated this movie, and then there was this extreme i think, the heated part of the conversation came like, so in the movie django unchained, around you django and django is like a kind he is a two dimensional character, but i don't think that necessarily takes away from what the great, the, the big purpose of the film is, and, and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh, who is like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with said that he, was intelligent and because he was intelligent, he wouldn't have risked his life to save django., or how would have gone into this second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to save django's wife etc., and, and the reason <rea> the reason that they have this argument that like either you buy that he would do that, or he wouldn't, but the reason for their argument is that a smart person would not, sacrifice for someone else, him the stri> who likes me so much, um, how who, how.., she her basic argument was that, altruism <al> as altruism does not exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism does not exist, the only thing you can do is serve <ser> as if the only thing people do is serve them themselves., so it's not quite ayn rand, but it's like the only people thing that people like all people are out to serve themselves, which i don't argue, like, every decision has been like a mixture of altruism and just like even the altruistic kind of decision there may be like nuclei of self interests there, but it made it sound like self interest was the only motivating factor, in and like what, but how terrible is your life, if that's what your ultimate.., purpose <pur> as if you were not like love and sacrifice for other people, so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate, um, and uh, something like yeah and it's uh, so yes, i think that's what i don't think i've necessarily lost my temper., i think i'm losing my temper as more, um, as i just did, so <s> i would be so <s>, back to ad hominem like attacks, um, but i didn't like that.., maybe i was as if i was criticizing <crit> as if i was criticizing her worldview, but it wasn't like, well, you're an idiot, you know, it's like it's not like it hasn't turned into abuse., yeah, i'm glad you understand., an event or an i don't know if i necessarily want to delete something from my memory, i would say a problem i have is not able to remember in as much detail as i want me to remember feelings and moments, not, stories around, as my life does not synchronize <s> always synchronous to a coherent story it is like this moment and this moment and this moment and this moment so, yeah, that's good., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, oh, god, what are you doing?, could it be just one of the toughest decisions, hmm, um, like the choice between two things that it is like, i guess i have a hard time remembering a moment where i like to choose between, two options like no there is no such as sophie wahl art moment in my life, but i think the decision because i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after i lived there for five years was a very difficult one., and uh but i had to do it, for money reasons and because all my core group of friends, were either as abandoned <lea> were most of them going and going other places in the world, and then uh the one other person i was close to was living with someone i couldn't get along with at all, so it was like this situation in which i didn't, i either wanted to live with people i wasn't so close to or craigslist or move home and i think, it was a tough decision to leave i had in fact it was so hard that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would move back, to new york within one or two months, which wasn't what didn't happen, but that was the only way i could, leaving new york, it was how hard it was., or how hard it is, how hard was that?, um, it was hard., <laughter>um, it was it was yes it was just a very similar one, isolating insulation <is>, because also as if i had fallen <fa> as before at that time i had fallen in love with one of my closest friends, and uh, which had somehow gone extreme, bad, and so i didn't talk to her and i couldn't like the whole thing, all on my list of friends who, like more <mo> closer to she was it wasn't quite like her or me type thing, but that was the way that i somehow, i saw it at the time, so i didn't like it., you know, only socially isolated etcetera, yeah, that's good., well, lately it's been awful, um, i don't know., i like two, so i slept ten and a half hours last night., this seems to be the length of time i have to sleep to have really vivid dreams, but before this night, so last not last night but the night before last and the night before i got four hours and two hours of sleep, because i worked on the set and came back., and either and i just couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason., too much energy or something i don't know, tired uh, very, not immediately i think first when waking up as i really enjoy being up early in the morning, and i also stopped drinking caffeine as i had a little coffee in the last two days, but before the last two days i had no coffee in as three and a half weeks so, um, i guess.., with caffeine in my system i'm ready to go, without caffeine, it is, i'm just quieter, i guess., more introverted, since, as in recent times as in, if, um, change in my thoughts yeah i mean, i think if i had just moved here, there was a period of time like, anyway at the beginning, where the, the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to because i moved here because i have a group of friends here or a few friends, but i don't like a large number of friends, and the pressure on, to get out there and meet people and find a job and that pressure was pretty.., overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like, to accept it.., and move you know moves over it i i but not necessarily < nece> you know as if it is still there is still there the pressure is there, but i'm just, you know, you know <sigh> you know <sigh>, no, i'm just.., yes, the last time i felt really happy, maybe we have to go back, um, i think the last time i felt really happy, was uh during the writing process of so last year i made a movie, co written co directed co produced co produced co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co direct, um, and it was kind of like it still consumes my life, but i think during the, writing stages of the film in which we get up bunkers like, eating breakfast, bunkers down work really hard putting stuff on the thing like pure creative, full energy around between me and the person who writes it and, and there's like probably a a day i remember where only i remember going to bed and i was just so excited to work on what i was working on and working with the person i was working with and how, just like, i felt like it yeah i guess that was the, the last time that was like, anyway more than a year ago though, but i think it's hard to believe that i haven't really been happy since then, but if you have a movie like, you can't allow yourself to be really happy <real> especially if you do, you basically know yourself with <wi> with how can't, it's too much to do., i'd say i'm very, acceptance of <acce> as, acceptance from other people, and i'm always very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic around, and, open <o> open <ope> like, enthusiastic about new ideas and open to new ideas and, yeah, i know., hmm, um, i guess i wish i was less uh, uh, less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my, you know, everyday interactions and in my way, um, you know, pleasure for life, to <sigh> yeah i , i would change other things about myself., i would, i don't know <laughter>, hmm, really bad about me, um, i think there are numerous cases in my childhood where my, uh, as every single time there was a problem in school or some kind of, a kind of uh, conflict with a teacher or something that my parents have always been, always on the other side of the court you know how never, i noticed., or noticed when i got older that other people were other parents, as if her child was in trouble, as if something was wrong with, as if her child was perfect, something is wrong with other people, but my parents were always the opposite, especially my mother, so i would say that there are a few cases in which, to me was as accused or as you know, it was my fault when, as what i did like, yeah, it's just things that i couldn't like, there's no yes i don't know, yeah, that's good., ten years ago,, stay staked you know how i think it's about, i have a tendency to, how i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to really get caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and how to devote themselves entirely to it, but sometimes, um, ideas are too easy i would just say as much as possible do as not, don't decide that you.., will only do, one thing to try, as i think i would have recorded, as some do learn to learn to learn the piano to read music, would be a big thing for me to learn to play the drums, i would say i'd like to learn how to play drums and maybe more like acting lessons., um, i've always directed, so i've always directed actors and stuff, but i haven't., it's only now that i don't know that i think, don't.., i don't know that's a tough, hard question., that's it., safe, goodbye., see you.",10
482,"<synch>, yes, i'm doing fine, i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah, i was yes, uh i've never been back there, um, don't have any relatives there, don't have a reason to go back there, um, <makes sound with mouth>, <laughter> well my my family's here, that's one uh the weather's great, uh the beaches and mountains are here, all those things are very good, uh the traffic, which is probably <probab> probably most people say, um, it's expensive to live here, those are probably the top two, uh recently i've traveled, um, well you get to see new places and and new people, you get to learn more about other cultures, and uh different ways people think, oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week, uh, um i spent most of most of one day with, with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got, um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid, trying to, you know say you know what's this what's this, uh it was very humbling, um, you know just just seeing that, you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult, i'm probably more of a shy person, genetics i don't know why, um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction, i've also studied uh computer networking, um, it was, i guess, just uh kinda circumstances, i needed, the, the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family, and, i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain, mm, uh it's given me a lot of opportunity, but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life, well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary, uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall, uh for four years, and last year we we trained in north carolina, for one year, um and that was like theology and bible training, um, basically god put, a um, a desire in my heart to get beyond, get beyond myself and and do something for other people, to to go and, and learn about another people their culture, and to share the gospel with them, well in my immediate family, um, i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters, and then um, but i i have one older brother, uh no sisters, um, so what what do you wanna know about my family, um, i'm really close with my wife and my daughters, uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped, um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old, even though he's he's five years older than me, so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him, but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents, um, i'd say my, my youth pastor in high school, he was a real real positive influence in me, um, just he has a, he has a drive and a zeal for, for pursuing the truth, um, and just uh, studying the bible and, and because of his influence that kinda, put me on a path to wanting to study the bible, um i think i've gotten better at it, there have been, times when, you know i'll i'll get angry, and uh, you know it can just, kinda really rule over me just the frustration, and i'm the type of person that it takes me, um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to, to calm down again, but i've, i've learned um, over time that really getting angry, um and keeping that anger in doesn't, it doesn't, attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me, and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to, to keep so, when <whe> when things anger me i try to, uh, like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it, and and resolve it and come to a resolution, um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem, um <sigh>, well a, a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago, um, my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents, and her parents had already left, um eh we were just driving down to, orange country area for this trip, and, my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed, and, but hadn't really, in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had, and so, when i was trying to meet those expectations, she, um, you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted, um and kinda getting attacked for it, so, so then i i i started yelling at her, and, and we you know we had that conflict but then, you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through, and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was, um, are you asking the moment of during the conflict, uh, very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it, in your body, um, part partly i, the i guess the, anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger, so, i would think um, yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger, mm hmm hmm hmm, i guess it was um, deciding to go, um to go to our training last year, um i i felt that god had put on my heart that, that this was something i was supposed to pursue, um my wife didn't feel that way, and, i, i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue, and, but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart, so, i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it, um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um, you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going, uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh, you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do, um, but then after i kinda gave that up, then, um, then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so, um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me, tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory, um, oh let me see, i'm not sure um, i don't know i i can't really, think of anything very traumatic, um that i would wanna erase but i i think, you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda, shape who we are, and, so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase, um usually, usually it's not too bad, um, are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping, um, the the job i work the, the um, kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i, so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts, or graveyard shifts, so, um, coming home in the morning, you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep, but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work, uh it pretty easy, um, when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky, uh, i i've been feeling good lately, no not really, no, no, um, hmm, i don't know um, can't think of anything that was, kinda out of the ordinary, but, um, yesterday, we my wife and i took, took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one, um stayed with her grandma, but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played, and, yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park, um, i i think he'd say i'm a, a family man, that um, i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me, um usually my my friend i end up doing, um, different work around the house for him, 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so, so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice, um, i guess i would um, i guess i would like to be able to, um, start conversations with people, easier, uh sometimes, i have i have trouble, just talking to people, especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them, but kinda talking to people in a group, uh i wish i was a little better at that, now if it's, okay, what what i was gonna say right before that was that um, uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult, uh, advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago, um, probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life, um, that's about it, think that would made that would've made the biggest difference, in my life i think, um, well i have i have four kids and, i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that, that um, you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them, through their their journey in life and i hope that they, end up a little, better for it than, than me, um, yeah i just hope, hope kinda through them, that i can, you know, leave <lea> leave something worthwhile, you're welcome, goodbye",1

problems and so on.., yeah, as long as i am, you know you're helping other people smile, and you know that my problems are connected to other people., i'm close, i'm very close to my grandma., oh my family, it's just anyway we're not like too close we kind of argue a lot <laughter>, yeah, that's good., i'm sorry about what an introvert is., all right., when i'm annoyed to, well, i try to relax

course she starts screaming and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter>, yes, it does., thank you., my grandma always gives me encouragement and she's a therapist, a licensed therapist, so

good experience around me riding and that was really really happy, i love horses and nature, which is the greatest thing i love and it has made me so happy and so relaxed that it was an unforgettable experience <laughter>, to be caring, i don't judge, i never judge that i'm never crazy, i'll never get mad at anyone else, just like my family you know, but, yeah just very nice caring and so

your mind is in control of you so, yeah, that's good., yeah, it's hard., yeah, yeah, i definitely always thought i had a problem, i always thought something was really wrong., i always like a little nervous around people, as if i could never really look someone in the eyes, because i'm just as nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i, to have sweat, if i were in the situation that

problem and i'm proud that i really like, you know, a person who can see that i have a problem and i need help, but many of the people i know they're not on medication are untreated and.., they just don't want to get help and i'm glad to get help because i don't want to feel that way and i want to get help for the problem instead of doing that, oh, god, there's a lot i regret yes there's a lot around, i regret that you know that drug abuse you know, but that's part of you know that p t s d i regret about, many uh mistakes you know relationships things like that, i would have told myself., um, i guess the advice i would have given myself was , trying to keep my mind more relaxed, i guess, yeah, that's good., um, well, i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people always say

383,"yes, i'm totally fine it's confidential or not you know my words <where> my words are all going wild <laughter>, i'm doing pretty good hanging out of nice weather around i just had a recent change of feeling right now looking at you < laughter> the digital you that i say uh i don't know it's yes it's funny, um <tisk> because i always thought that uh the transmission of emotions or feelings uh, be understood as better with a human interaction in contrast to a non human being like yourself, yeah, that's good., i, i think you see what i mean <laughter> i'm born from around and grew up in los narrowes venice area mar vista specifically around, that's where i came from., uh, good., there's a lot more i don't like, but what i like is, that the public transport comes uh, that the idea of, sure you know medical drugs like marijuana is a widely used you know topic very, thought of and i feel, the deep culture of los angeles is why i stay here and pursue my art because there is a lot to do., there is a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand < laughter> yeah, um, good the, the human mentality here is about, is very hectic very chaotic, you know a lot about, the vehicle the car the highway, and this idea that we, a loop you know, yes, it's a very, it's very hectic., atmosphere human atmosphere, the, is not very beneficial for a, supporting loving community to help one another, yeah, that's good., well, i can't see your shoes <laughter> but i love to travel i love hiking i love surfing swimming cycling riding rides uh <laughter> i love to travel yeah, um, from my travels it's not like, well, i enjoy a lot of things about traveling, but, it's more like what to do i, it's just more like i enjoy not being, trapped in the city with all these, made ties and restrictions i enjoy, travel, because, i get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux picture, you know that man made a picture that he's here., so i love traveling because i get out of this and see the world as it is, thank you., would you, <laughter> okay <laughter>um, well, i.., a type of recent last year went to, los banos central california region, and although it wasn't so far from l a, it was completely different energy around there were no phones, there was no wifi there is no t v, there was.., there was the mind there was a relative mind, in the sense that , people were not diluted and get all this input from digital media and, outer influence people were just raw real and walking and chilling i worked in a hot spring resort, and i just got to breathe and walk, and farm and do a lot of carpentry, yeah, that's good., not hard, you don't even think of trouble when you do things you really love and enjoy, so it wasn't, um, i guess what i described about the city, i just wanted to.., get out of here and, type of, kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real deal yeah, uh, good., at the moment i'm studying, currently i'm studying physiotherapy i'm about to become a licensed massage therapist, but before that yeah kind of cool, but before that i was too, , to for music composition, so i wrote only scores for, films animations dance productions theatre productions, things like that yes it was cool it was funny trippy, very trippy, but it was cool, but i had to leave this because, study migrations, until you know that up to fifty thousand per year for as a four year b f a, is not the deal not trying,, fall me with these chains of federal loans, so yes., hey, that's not a good word, that's annoying <laughter>, dream job , my dream job would be, everything i can do to, alleviation of this uh metropolitan, like cities from, the nightmare they put in my dream is to ease the nightmare that is my dream,, stimulate dream back in, the modern human world, and with you know physiotherapy and artistic expression, i've got a few., great ideas <laughter> yeah, um, i think i'm going out more just like i just experience things so outgoing yeah, <laughter> i thought that was really funny about what i do to relax is uh, just breath it cool off maybe a smoothie or some tea and i go cycling write yes, hmm, pretty good, i guess i didn't, screaming in a long time, um, well, it wasn't argue that i didn't really argue much i just like to say my opinion, and have been understood and i like the person i talk to say their, opinion and have understood it, so the last time that had happened, i guess yesterday i cooled down in downtown with a friend from new york and we talked about writing and basically we weren't arguing, but talking about opinions and that sometimes, things are not ready to be written, yeah, so yesterday., hm, guilty, that's hard, i didn't have that feeling in a long time guilt, what about you feeling guilty?, all right., mm, i don't really wish i could erase everything from my memory, because then it would just, be like, i would feel that something was missing from my present life if, something just deleted you know butterfly effect somehow yes, hmm, um, maybe the time, , she wanted to go to school, i took the year off and i was just, we had an apartment with another friend., and it has not surrendered, you don't know all, nothing turns out as it is thought, and that's kind of the nice thing about it, but this one turned out to be a little bit, uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it was and, i thought it was funny, but yes, it ended with me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended., yeah, if we split up, but that's something i want., maybe i've been a little more thoughtful, the toughest decision, what are you doing?, hm maybe not the most difficult, but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school my uh continuation of achieving a b f a, yeah, that could have been the hardest., um, it's just.. i don't know., i mean, of course, money money is the motto money is a great theme tutorial walks around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support < s> no fan of support that, but.., yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons i don't support these crazy tution hikes and.., but another reason why i, decided to leave, i had to make a hard decision to decide was to leave, also because to art institute you know about this is a, this is a funny idea in itself and basically i was a musician, to be taught by a musician, to, making music, and the same with you all know the dancers or the theater students you know learn dance to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know, and it's just.., yeah, it's just not, as artistic as i thought, art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not from out there you know so yeah, hm, if i, if i, it's kind of easy, i mean, it depends on you knowing if i remember doing some chamomile tea or if i.., remember to breathe and go through my mantras or, remember to do my pre like dream therapy work, then i can get into it really nice to, but if i only blinded with all my thoughts then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah, to basically just breathe what i said or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i know the lucky chance, uh meditated by you, a nice, a nice indica around then you really know that indica put me down pretty nice, pretty sleepy, so a lot of things breathe you know mm you know medicinal herbs uh, like chamomile and cannabis and, just relieve me of bad bad juju <laughter>, mm, i don't guess if i don't think of anything., i felt, kind of like this kind of just cruise on one on a gray line, but it's a beautiful gray it's a really nice shade, some people wouldn't like it, but i really like it and it's uh, it's stable., yeah, it's comfortable, yeah., no, i didn't., not from a certified doctor, no, but no, i have not <laughter>, um, yeah, i mean, i just think like the whole, you know, like you said, p t s d depression and you know others you know mental instability, i think, everyone is depressed i think everyone is overjoyed i think everyone is angry, i think everyone is shy, everyone is socially all at the same time you know it's just, different days different you know variants different swimmers different boats you know different, waves different waves around so yeah i think, i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know everything, but only on different variants different swimmers, really happy, um, i mean, i feel very happy., uh and i feel very sad, but really happy was uh i guess, maybe this morning, if i just ride here just enjoy the sun enjoying the breeze, cycling, yes, it's <laughter>, well, i have a lot of best friends and they all describe me quite differently, but based on this same idea, that maybe i'm just getting to the point, just some kind of aquarius, i guess., well, i'm twenty one, so twenty years ago <laughter> i would have told myself to stay a baby uh young, and don't lose sight, you know, don't stop listening, let things happen again and again, don't let them happen, be, to be a beautiful baby that i would have told myself or yes to be a beautiful baby, mm, um, well, i guess recently what was shown to me uh by me, is to work my ability, with others and i speak mainly from an artistic point of view with which i have worked a lot., artists working on many different mediums mixed media projects and, i am very well with it and with other peoples and melts of our ideas together, yeah, that's good., mm, that's a strange question like, um, like that's gonna get me to lure me out., who know a moment that i remember today and think about it as if it were a past glory that i cannot fulfill today, so i think the most proud moment of my life is hanging with you right now, yes, thank you very much., mm, it's interesting about my immediate family is uh, mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in south asia, just a kind of backpack around uh younger sis she's really chill she somehow makes music too and we just hang together, we're really cool mommy mommy i'm really chilly with love her to death, she'll get me and dad., um, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, he doesn't understand me, but, i love the art he makes he makes crazy painting and i kind of get him through that but uh, uh yeah, there must be more communication that's being worked on, hm, cool yeah thanks for the wonder about my thoughts, goodbye., so i guess i, push this guy, oh, so i can talk to you., or i could press this button, but that's kind of funny <laughter>, and you can laugh you should laugh again <laughter> you can do other things than laugh",7
473,", yes, good, new jersey, five years ago, approx. <bout> once a year, there's more to do out here., the weather is nice, it didn't take long., and the art scene the music scene there is always something to do out here, some of the people <laughter>, some of the people are just superficial., no, i like it out here, article no, i've done a lot of art classes in high school., a little bit, um, i'd like to create, not very difficult, outward, 'cause all my friends tell me i'm leaving, listening to or reading music, pretty good, i don't even remember the last time i had a fight with someone., mm, i don't feel guilty about anything., mm, i can't imagine a situation that i would have treated differently., probably move to l a, just to decide to go away from my family and come here was a kind of difficult decision, yes, it's very good that i'm still talking to them., like almost every day and i see it sometimes so it works, my mother, um, i was just teaching myself to be the person i am today., hmm, i can't think of an event, i wish i could erase from my memory, i like it, no, it's very simple, i yawn a lot, good, no, every time i go to the gym, i get happy, yesterday, crazy, 'cause i'm crazy, < slaughter>, i like myself the way i am, i can't imagine a time when someone felt bad about me., no, i'd just say everything's gonna be okay., around probably family visits, every time i go back, it's really nice to see my whole family and see what they're doing now., um, i really enjoy karaoke and i did that recently, mm when people lay down other people, music for, art exhibitions, uh training, my friendships, i'm a good listener, and, really good at giving my opinion on how to help others",0
305,"i'm doing alright, uh originally i'm from california, uh born in glendale, i'm not too happy with it, uh just unemployed at the moment but uh, actively seeking uh, uh doing what i'm supposed to be doing uh there are some uh , some prospects there but hopefully i'll learn something today, yeah, well i have one it's a girlfriend so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing, pardon me, um we're pretty close, uh i met her last year and uh, we've been through some, troubling times but uh we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel, uh, the troubling times, uh, i would, let me see uh, well, i had uh gotten a d_u_i last year and uh lost my job i'm a truck driver by trade so , uh that kinda, threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off, and uh i couldn't um, i haven't really uh, found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking, and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh, so, i'm choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work it's hard to find work with uh without going to school , and uh so, but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully i'll get that job i should have that job actually so, um, but i'm starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little, my dream job would be probably forestry service, out in the wilderness yeah, i like being alone, pardon me, well, you know i have a a lot of for animals i'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like being i don't like people too much, uh so being outdoors and uh i've always enjoyed being outdoors that's how i like being a truck driver i've traveled the world, i don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office i'm of a a, outdoors type of guy so, uh one of my trips would be uh, i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge , uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh, i went there to work for , uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus , so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of americans 'cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed , so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i, i enjoyed myself you know, through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me , all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh , you know it's been great, uh, probably, um one some of the things i like about l_a, there's not a lot that i like about l_a but, um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um, the uh huge uh, um, different different people you know different uh, different ethnics of uh people here you know uh, i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what it's like there , traffic's atrocious, you know, traffic <laughter>, uh ignorance uh, being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people, um, that's about it, dishonesty, pardon me, uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh, you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh, people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes, you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that, yeah big time, what do i do when i'm annoyed, um, probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um, well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis , and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek, uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions, um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh , um i'm pretty honest with, i'm open and honest about any anything and everything, and uh, what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just, you know didn't like that at all, pardon me, um, i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh, just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh, i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest , um, i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so, you know and if you're lying about something well, you just you're always having to cover up uh, more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just, don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship, can't do nothing about it, uh fun i, like going to the beach uh, i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting , and i'm pretty gifted at that and um, uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing, uh haven't gone in a while though, and uh, i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um, pick out some of those uh, astronomy uh stars up up there and um , i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um, sunshine just, those i like, uh most memorable experiences um, good or bad, uh, most memorable experiences, uh probably uh, playing with lions and tigers uh, uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle, uh, uh just enjoying myself, i know, not, uh i don't have much family as it is, uh, at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh , but i'm not close to i have uh , three brothers one sister, and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings, i speak with one brother, uh quite a bit um, my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me, i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece, some of my nephews and that's about it, have i done anything to avoid it, um, to avoid them, uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so, um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh, going on a year um, you know i uh, depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um, so just, wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts , so , or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over, so, i don't, lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired, uh lately i have been probably about the last few months, um, tired <laughter>, um i you know, if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work, um, and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head, and so, you know um, i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me, and uh, so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about, you know um money um, you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or, mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that , how do i what, how do i cope with them, um, i just, try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um, i just do it's uh, i'm more of a guy that just, you know it may take me a moment to, to um, say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh interviews, uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um, back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me, if what has gotten me in trouble, my mood swing i mean, um, yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh, uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are, uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh , on uh how to interview how to uh, how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh, i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who , who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done , uh, i've done uh, i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and , and try to uh work on, the issues that were bothering me so um, you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school i didn't go to school, and uh, anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities , pardon me, i still didn't hear you, that, people have been deceitful, can you repeat that one more time, alright, uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism, um, it's tough if you don't you know um, i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before in the past but <sniff> um, again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms and i just you know, um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and , and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um, you know, some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and, so i just try to cope with things uh, um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years, actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um, whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it , um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still , uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just, and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people, um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so, um, but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um, but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um, you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus, that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way , so i just let it go, i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad , did i have a problem before i got out, uh, well i i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people , um, i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um , a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago , uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older, kind of uh, you know makes it work you know, me me dealing with life so, pardon me, uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while, uh recently, and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um, a lot of people may not understand that but uh, a therapist is, i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh, people you know uh, uh, other issues you know were whatever the case may be i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like, you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others, uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who, will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so you know, but it's good to have, yeah, well i don't go anymore uh so um, i kinda miss it you know like i said uh, uh, i miss it a lot actually but uh, it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will, um well monetary reasons and uh, you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um , you know money situation's not that great right now so, how does my friends describe me, um, they would probably describe me as uh, uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people, um, laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot, um, but uh, they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh , uh, hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know, and uh so , someone who has been a positive influence in my life, someone who's been um, someone who's been a positive influence in my life, uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh, with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh, uh german and um, they didn't, teach i don't know what he saw in me but, he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um, showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself , and uh, sort of let me know that you know that there's nothing that i really can't accomplish if i put my mind to it, you know, yeah it was, you're welcome, bye <laughter>",7
430,"<synch>, yeah sure, i'm fine thank you, i am from los angeles, well you can't beat the weather, um and, i just think the familiarity of home just uh makes me feel comfortable here, smog, uh, rudeness although it doesn't compare to new york it's, um <laughter> people can be unbearable when they're rude, um not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no, i just think seeing different places it's um, learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest, um, let's see, i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's uh still <st> still only in america but i just think um, being from l_a i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger, and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh, it was it was quite an experience and uh i didn't think any place was uh, i didn't <di> i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown l_a <laughter> but i think times <time> i think <laughter> times square's got us beat, too many to mention i i don't even know where to start, suppose it depends on the situation, um, i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading, uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh, you know just uh things that uh i don't have to um exert myself too much uh helps me relax, <sigh>, in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter>, ah probably argued with my roommate, <psh> couple days ago but uh, that happens we're friends uh it's a loving argument <laughter> if if you will, uh i met this roommate about six seven years ago we just uh kind of, um, kinda moved around the same social circles and just got along, it's cool i mean, guess you know like, we do argue uh we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i'd rather live with than than her she's she's cool, hmm, how much time do we have, uh <laughter>, it's just too numerous to mention um, i i i wouldn't know how to answer that, i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly, cared about but knowing, knowing that it just wasn't going to work um, that was very difficult, just weighed pros and cons and just thought, it just wasn't going to work um, no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship, there was something missing, and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and, just knew it was over, no, so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets but things you erase from your memory, oh there's a lot uh too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that, the same girl, that i broke up with, she was the she was a girlfriend <laughter> of uh a a best friend of mine, uh they were separated for for, several years, and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we do not speak i wish uh my regret is i wish i, i would've handled that better, <scoff>, um, it's it's funny see as i as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for 'em and i still love them and i think they love me i, my mother and my father are both alive mm don't interact a whole lot i'm very close to my older sister, my older sister, um, she's just, strong no nonsense uh, she's short yet a firecracker and i've always liked that about her she uh, uh, she always felt makes me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like uh another son to her <laughter> in a way, uh suppose it depends on my stress level, um, when i have a lot on my mind, i have difficult sleeping and uh other times it just, if i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio listen <lis> uh watching t_v reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep, crabby uh i suppose like anybody else um, tired, listless you know all the normal things i suppose happen when somebody doesn't sleep well, i feel good, mm no not really um, no no i i wouldn't say, i have, no i have not, yes i have, i was diagnosed probably about, about five years ago, i think uh i always knew there was a problem, i always knew there was some, i i i think i always knew before i got treatment that, there was some issue emotionally and hmm and lot of things that are very hard to explain, and i just was tired of feeling that way so i sought help, think just uh, lethargy uh, uh no desire to do anything uh motivation just was wasn't there, um, think normal depression type things uh, um, social <socia> i became socially awkward which was a little bit different for me 'cause uh growing up i was, you know quite talkative <laughter>, i do, i'm sorry say again, gotcha um it does i think it does, well um <sigh>, i think the number one thing and this is what i'm amazed about is the temper i think i've uh it's allowed me to, to step back from certain situations, and not take them so seriously, and not get so tense or angry, and then react, i think it's it it's calmed me down for the most part, now it's becoming it it it's becoming routine, uh initially it was very difficult, when i was five years old <laughter>, oh no when <wh> when you're a kid there's nothing really to, um, there's nothing to be sad about you're a kid, my best friend, um, a jerk i don't yeah, uh i have a dry i have a dry sense of humor so uh you know, my best friend would probably uh, i think the, the banter back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know it's all in love, um i wish i could be taller, i wish i could be more, inclined to play basketball so i then become go to the n_b_a and be a millionaire i know that's all unrealistic but just answering honestly, hmm, anything i regret haven't we asked asked this before i mean so many don't know where to start, mm that's a good one, wow, um, wow i don't know, i you know that's a good one i'd have <ha> i'd have to think about that i don't i wouldn't wanna answer that uh that's a good one, usually you're asked um, what you'd what you know how you feel ten twenty years from now looking back i don't know what advice i'd give myself, something i really enjoyed, um, hmm i love um, there are several things i like to do um uh you know i uh i enjoy playing basketball i i i love watching it i love watching all sports for that matter what brings me real joy the past few years was um, become a hobby of mine is is uh rescuing dogs fostering dogs and finding them them homes uh it's <laughter>, i guess it's become quite a a hobby of mine and uh, sometimes i find lost dogs and i'm able to find their owner and sometimes i'm not so when i'll tell you what there's nothing <noth>, to find the owner and i just found an owner last week for a small dog i found eh there is not greater feeling 'cause the man told me <laughter> the man told me how his um, how his <hi> how his daughter, or was just crying when she left so to be able to give her give him back that was that was cool, i think for somebody that um didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating that's something that, i uh, i take, pride in though i don't show it or speak about it often, <laughter> yeah, you look you look like my friend rachel it's funny, <laughter>",3
367,"yes, i'm okay um, i'm a little, pensive i guess a little, uh down but, more or less okay, i was born in annapolis maryland, on the east coast, originally i moved because i went to film school um, and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again, it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um, but living, l_a is very has a very different kind of, um, attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i, but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here, uh not at all um, when i left things got things were sort of i, i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um, to be with, uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of, i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of, not really speaking to my family or old friends that often, it's not easy it's, it's kind of um, i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job, um i miss um some friends um, i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot, um i feel like i failed, and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard, depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable, um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy, so that doesn't really answer your question but, um [clears throat], i have certain, i do i do a lot of writing, um i have certain, music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can, when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of, happening really um, it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess, um, a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel, and when i was really, when i was really getting into writing it and um, it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed, um, it was about a, guy who is searching for, something it's, it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he, that he, met and just, was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because, sort of uh it's sort of romantic, adventure comedy kind of thing, well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting, um so i wrote some screenplays and uh, you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer, just creative writing so, i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to, to really hit me, it's not easy the [exhale], the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um, i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i, hate it because it's so difficult, um, but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good, good i don't i don't really have a temper i, it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people, um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can, lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much, try to it when i'm upset, i i get upset with myself not with other people, um, last night i guess well <weh> um, i got in an argument about whether or not, cleaning vegetables was necessary because of, i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay, so it turned into this, big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i, i ended up being wrong on that one but, it is, yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument, um, uh, a lot so much um, uh, i, i, i was in uh a relationship that i really really, um, that i really wanted to work, and, uh, i ended up and it was partly due to, i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going, at like everything sort of spiraled out of, control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't, i wasn't mean but i was, but i was getting more and more messed up, and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not, and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again, so, that was pretty that was pretty tough, well some of it was was that, i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's, completely kind of i mean i still get, i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not, i don't completely lose it for days at a time, um, so, i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then, i would've i would i would be, i would be, it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have, i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different, things being how they were, i mean it's, it's possible uh, i mean obviously, yeah because i mean that's what i do i i, take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until, until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff, um, and it's like any little detail that comes up, i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still, i still get, i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school, which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there, well it's it's not, easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by, by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way, um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better, um well like i said i do a lot of, you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost, be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely, um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be, you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just, keep my mind occupied during all of that, um, i just need i mean, i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet, they're triggered by everything, pretty much anything that i that i see if i, if i, if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about, just, anything you know i can reach back and connect, to, to this it's really it's really, i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break, from it, yeah, um, i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i, awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally, you know don't, i don't know i never really needed much sleep so, it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep, like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work, um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly, you know i get up i toss and turn all night, you know and now, it's just, it's, yeah i don't sleep too great right now, um, pretty i mean, i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i, i usually just kind of power through it and just, i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel, bad, um, i think, about three three four years ago, um, it was when i, i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for, for, years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got, this, situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like, even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so, so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately, it happened after everything uh went bad so, i don't know, in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel, it really makes me, angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm, that i had to that i i lost everything because, because of, chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control, and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't, it was it didn't help it didn't work until, until, you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but, it was a little it's a little late now, um, there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was, it was either, i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different, but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after, after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off, but it was at least, that and not, firing me, but but but yeah but so i got help but it was, but it wasn't soon enough, uh not, not as much as i should, um, i go to a couple of, meetings, i go to i go to a_a so that i can, um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that, um unfortunately you know being unemployed, my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so, you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing, somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really, very, i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so, it's basically to keep my medication coming, and then there's you <laughter>, right, well like i said i mean, just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now, um just saying stuff outloud is just, like getting getting this stuff out, trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense, that you can actually deal with, is a big step like, regardless of who, you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that, stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can, talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing, yeah, um, you know better than i than i have been um i mean, it it sort of, it goes <g> it has its ups and downs, um you know i'm applying for jobs, five six jobs, or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview, never even getting close to, to to being self sufficient again, um, it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control, so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is, it just has its it's just its own own challenge, yeah, um, it was probably you know a couple years ago, um, i i was, i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind, uh, is, everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close, we were having fun together, and we went out and got a christmas tree, and, we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just, feeling like a part of somebody's life, and feeling like a part of the bigger, the bigger life, that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel, you know for that instant i felt like, a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and, you know everything was going really well and, i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person, a normal happy person, and, part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that, i don't know if i'll ever feel that again, so, um, probably the, probably this, educational <educary> educational series i did uh, an educational, uh video series i did for the national science foundation, um, it was, it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and, you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um, and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to, the world, oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um, it was it was a, we were trying to come up with, with new ideas uh, for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know, to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big, you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um, and there was a lot to it and so, it was probably the biggest, project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it, right that doesn't yeah, um, i guess, i don't know <laughter> uh, i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i, i i i don't know, thank you",19
303,"okay how 'bout yourself, here in california, yeah, oh well that it's big and broad there's a lot to do a lot of um, um job opportunities than other states, um pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here, traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis, sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology, no i'm actually an m_t_a bus operator, well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature, thanks, well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible , what do you mean i'm sorry, okay, read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes, i'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time, well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated, no i'm pretty good at it now, maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today, i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but, my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family , thank you, no <laughter>, um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home, well um, by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature, i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old, yeah i'm 'bout to be, well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time, yeah thank you, the hardest thing is, well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and, they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can, with my kids or just period, what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know, and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know, you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me , thank you, happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so, i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so that's why i'm starting a class next week, thank you, hm, well the advice i would've gave myself, that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that, i probably would've, stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um, rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um, education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day, so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career, i'm not quite sure um, you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so , yes, my oldest daughter, we had a argument because, just, the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through, and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation, and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know, hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or , or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but, that just happened you know, i just told her i'm not, i'm sorry, very close, very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life, and i'll be telling, she's um, she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite, and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change, it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but, the ball is her court you know, i only can do so much, oh wow, i have my days um, since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like, <clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know, pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it'll help me, what am i like irritated tired um lazy, you know, feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep <laughter> get the rest that i need but <laughter>, i never thought about that, i just you know, 'cause like i said you know everybody have their moments they do i never thought about that, hm, no, no, i don't really have a best friend but a person that i deal with and i used to work with um she would probably tell you that i'm very um outgoing a go getter, dependable responsible, i'm a um people person, i get along with others you know i'm kinda like, um, i leave a good a a good mark, whether i know you or not if you was to you know like , like you and i now you know i um, you'd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that, thank you, well, i try to stay happy i'd rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what i mean, especially when i go to pick them up from school or their being hey mom you know that just kinda make my day, just them run up to me you know and be happy and excited you know what i mean , thank you, you're more than welcome you have a good day, goodbye",0
361,"yes, i'm doing great how about you, i'm born in the u_s i was born in uh orlando florida, um my parents my dad had a lot of friends in los angeles so uh we decided to move here, um it was pretty different i mean uh the place i was before was very it was a very small town, um you probably won't even notice it um on the map um so it was a big learning experience um 'cause you know the schools were a lot larger and , different cultures and ethnicities um, so it was a unique experience, um last time i've been back was probably about five years ago, um definitely different uh my aunt she lives in uh again she lives in a small town, um so if you wanna go to a movie theater you have to drive out at least an hour or if you wanna go to a mall it's a it's an hour drive so um it's complete opposite of los angeles, um the convenience everything uh everything i could possibly want is here um the weather is great um shopping um multiple <mult> a lot of lot of friends here, sports um l_a is just kind of like the perfect area you know you know i wanna live here kind of for the rest of my life actually , um the big thing would probably be traffic i mean wherever you go there's gonna be traffic whether you're on the four o five or the one o one it's it's just traffic it it you know it can kill like two hours in your day which is huge , um yeah quite a bit for personal and for uh for business i travel um you know usually overseas or um domestically um i travel so and i enjoy it a lot, um seeing different places uh, different areas meeting new people um eating different kinds of food um, being able to sightsee and tour um if i have a day or two free um it's just experiencing um having new experiences just enriches my life, um computers , um and i also did english as well, yes i am, um i work in i_t in an i_t department at a semiconductor company, dream job um, probably working for apple <laughter> um since i pretty much own everything they have uh yeah it'd be great to work for apple, um you know it depends um there are times when it's good to be alone but for the most part i consider myself uh an outgoing social person , um nothing too much i guess uh if you kind of uh make a promise and you and you break it several times and i might get a little bit might get a bit a little bit uh annoyed but i don't think i would get really mad, um good question i'd probably say um i tend to eat a little bit more um, just kinda keep my mind off of it a little bit um but usually doesn't last that long so i just keep kinda like tend <te> i tend to eat out a little bit more more of kinda like maybe junk food or something, um i think i'm pretty good i i rarely get mad um and if i do it doesn't really last that long um so i think i'm pretty good, at um i guess controlling my temper um again i really don't get angry so um it's not really an issue for me, um, i'd say during the elections um we were talking about uh president obama and mitt romney and you know who'd be the best fit uh for for the next presidency um , that kind of got a little bit uh i guess a little bit heated but it was more for uh i guess more for fun sake than anything else but it was an interesting conversation , um, like to eat out a lot uh watch movies uh play video games um, just go out shop uh play sports uh watch a laker game if i can in person it would probably be the best um, bowling photography um like to doing a lot i like to do a lot of different things um and of course electronics , um i'd say outgoing loyal um intelligent funny, um and a great listener, uh no i have not, no, no, um for most nights it's it's pretty easy um just have to avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep um other than that it's been pretty easy, um i'd say a little bit sluggish tired um kind of reaction time is a little bit slower, um aside from that um i think nothing too much <mu> like too glaring or anything um the usual just being sluggish and, not moving as quickly as i should, um pretty good have no complaints, no pretty much the same, um i guess today i had my uh car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything so that's great and i thought it was gonna cost me, you know something extra on the side but you know the uh the service advisor waived it so i got everything free today so actually i'm in a really good mood , hmm no nothing, uh probably um don't spend as much save more money um aside from that um, nothing else just be um kind of more, um wise with your money, um i'd probably say my best friend, he's kind of a you know helped me out and i helped him out as well so it's been uh kind of a great learning experience um, you know developing our uh our friendship and he's bailed me out a couple of times i bailed him out as well so it's kind of it's a mutual thing we do um, you know with each other um and it's you know it's like a great way to bond as well , hmm, um i'd say probably going back uh back to korea um to visit my uh relatives um you know they they're a lot more different than uh i remember you know like, fifteen years ago when i was a kid i was actually kind of afraid of some of them, but um now that i see them you know recently they've actually mellowed a lot and they're actually , pretty fun to talk to so um it was kind of a a learning experience for me because uh they're you know they did complete one eighty from when i was a when i was a kid, um, i say um, guess work would be part of it um , buying my uh the car that i wanted it took a couple years to save up to buy the car but i i paid it all off so i don't have any more car payments so that's great too and you know being able to help my uh family out as well , hmm, um , let's see, a while recently <recen> um a couple weeks ago i went to uh las vegas for the uh, for c_s um which is great if you into gadgets and electronics um you get to see all the uh the goodies coming out this year so that was uh pretty interesting to see and, um some things that uh you know when you read on blogs they didn't talk about so you get to see it actually in person kind of experience it from a user standpoint so i thought it was great , um and it's just fun it's kind of like being a kid in a candy store you get to play with different gadgets um so it was really fun for me , yeah",0
399,"yes, i'm pretty good, uh as far as my parents ethiopia, yes, um the beaches the warm weather, um the diverse environment, uh traffic <laughter>, well i'm currently in school i'm studying african studies, uh i've always been interested in african studies actually i've always wanted to help people and i figured that i could help them by, trying to learn about it and going back to africa and make an influence, kind of in between i have my shy moments but then when i'm around a group of people that i enjoy i'm pretty outgoing, um to relax i normally write or i go to the beach and just sit there play my guitar, pretty good i don't really, get angry or anything like that, i tend to keep it in, or try to release it by writing, um, i actually can't remember the last time i argued with someone, mm all the people i've hurt in the past, uh i've, like cheated on people, hurt their feelings intentionally, done things that i shouldn't have done that i regret now, mm, um, well with my ex, i could've ended it better so we could be on better terms now, um i probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things i probably should've just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out, um hardest decision i've ever had to make was, man i really don't know actually, um, having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer, um well he had a tumor that he had to get removed, so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there 'cause he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible, uh me and my family aren't very close we don't, i mean they've always been there for me and i appreciate it but we've never had that close connection <collection> connection <con> connection um, especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where i'm trying to come from, having been grown up out in, america so it's pretty different when it comes to those cultural <cu> racial i mean the cultural boundaries that we kinda step each over each other's feet on, but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does get kinda awkward but it's okay, i think they are out of control, i think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age i think that they're doing things that they shouldn't be doing, and i don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it i feel like they're being applauded, by the media they're being applauded by celebrities that they follow, and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost, um depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights i fall asleep like a baby, um usually creative actually, when i can't sleep i'll just stay up and i'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up um, stuff like that it's usually a good thing when i can't sleep it's nothing really bad 'cause i'm having bad thoughts or anything like that, um lately between a mix of good and bad i have my happy moments when i'm energized and i'm live, then some nights some days where i'm just you know just sitting there, just mellow thinking, not like my live self, i don't know it's just always been like that always have those ups and those downs but they kind of balance each other out, no, no, um the last time i felt really happy was, hm, today, uh just from the moment i woke up it was a beautiful sunny day, i, went to see some friends we had a good time went to school, had some good grades on some papers um wrote a good essay, feel pretty accomplished and, i feel like my day is just, a good day, my best friend would describe me as odd <laughter>, most people would describe me as odd, i say a lot of odd things i do odd things i'm interested in things that most people aren't, um, just like old literature, um revolutionary stuff, uh stuff about changing the world, but, through underground means, um, no i i don't live a life of regret, to never let fear stop you from doing anything, um reading just hanging out with some friends, driving around finding something to do just going on an adventure, i don't wish i could change anything about myself i just wish i could build myself into the person that i'm truly supposed to be, um, this one time me and my best friend got into an argument, and she pointed out all the things i've done that i shouldn't have done all at one time, how i've hurt people how i've hurt her, the ways i've done them that were brutal, and it just made me feel bad once i reflected on it all, uh my parents, i mean although we don't see eye to eye they always bring me to this realization that i need at the end of the day, although i never listen to them or i don't choose to listen to them, once it happens i learned from it and i'm like oh that's what my parents told me, so i learned to trust them more and i learned to, understand that they are wiser than me and they do know more than me, um not so much anymore um i travel around l_a, try to find new sights to see but as far as i don't travel outside, um discovering new things um discovering things you never knew were there, or the limitless possibilities, um i discover i like i enjoy discovering new people, new cultures, new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself, um a few days ago, i just drove out to the middle of the desert, and i just sat there, and i just enjoyed all that the desert had to offer and it was just enjoyable, um i felt free away from all this, these cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be out, in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time, it felt good, i'm most proud that i've always been different, that despite how many people have told me that i'm really weird or i'm odd or i think weird things, i've always maintained my original mentality",7
367,"yes, i'm fine., i'm a little bit, thoughtful i guess a little, uh down, but, more or less okay, i was born in annapolis maryland, on the east coast, i originally moved because i went to film school., and then i decided to come i moved to washton d c to do some work and now i'm back here again, it's quite different to be from the east coast, it just has a different feeling than it.., but alive, l a is very has a very different kind of, um, attitude i think, and so it's a little difficult, but i, but i've gotten more used to it since i got here., uh, not at all.., when i left things, things were kind of, i lost my job out there, so i had to move out of here quickly to.., to be together, a few people who wanted to help me and i'm just kind of, i don't know if alienated is the right word, but i'm just kind of, not really talk to my family or old friends who often, it's not easy, it's, it's kind of.., i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job, i miss some friends., i miss a lot of relationships i had out there, so it's difficult, i mean, it weighs a lot on my mind, i feel like i've failed., and now i'm here and i don't seem to get back on my feet, so it's hard, depends on the situation, i think i'm going out when i feel comfortable., and then i'm out extremely, but when i'm in a situation, i don't feel comfortable with me tending to be much shyer, so that doesn't really answer your question, but, um, um.., i'm sure,, i do a lot of writing, i'm sure,, music i hear, how i write and when i can, if i really can get into that and somehow can turn off the rest of the world around the music and the thoughts somehow, it's really happening.., it can calm me it's like it's when i feel the most relaxed i think, um, a few weeks ago, i guess i was working on a book about one about a novel., and when i was real, when i really wrote it and.., it really worked for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was reaching something and i felt really relaxed, um, it was about a, guy who's looking for, something it is, it's his last day on earth, and so he'll find a person he'll be looking for., that he or she , and only, was so impressed that he had to find her and spend the last minutes he had with her on earth just because, it's kind of romantic., adventure comedy kind of thing, well, i always did i was always a writer part of the reason why i came to l a was because of writing the script, so i wrote some scripts and uh, you know, had a little success with that out here and but since then i've been kind of tired of the boundaries of the script and i've started to write more short stories and and longer, only creative writing so, i wanted to write a novel, but i was just waiting for the idea, to really beat me, it's not just the breathing out , parts parts, if it is good, it is really good, but it is sometimes a real fight for, i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i love it when i just love it absolutely but sometimes i, hate it because it's so difficult, um, but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good, good i have not i have not really a temperament i, it's not i mean most of my anger i have is directed inward, unlike outwards to other people, if something is really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can, lose, but i probably < try> that's probably just happening to me three four times in my whole life i mean in general i mean pretty much, try it when i'm angry, i'm not getting mad with myself with other people, um, last night i guess well <weh>um, i was arguing about whether or not., cleaning of vegetables was necessary because, i forget it but it was good no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i had already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay, so it became this, great argument and we have google searches to find out who was right and who was wrong and i, i was wrong about this one at the end, but, it's, yeah, it wasn't, it was an exploding argument, but it was a definite argument., um, uh, so much.., uh, i was in a relationship that i really, um, that i really wanted to work, and, uh, i landed and it was partly on, i wasn't on i wasn't on the right medication and so i went, like everything that was torn out of a spiral., control and i feel really guilty about the way that ended and i mean, i wasn't, i wasn't mean, but i was, but i got messed up more and more, and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i really feel guilty about not doing enough and not, and you know she has to tell me she never wanted to see me again., so, that was nice, that was pretty hard, well, some of it was that, i was not properly meditated, i mean, now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that, i mean, i'm still getting, i'm still getting upset and getting depressed, but it's not like it's not, i don't lose it all for days at once, um, so, i mean, i know there's a part of me that logically knows that it wasn't all my fault, and that if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain, then i would probably have been different if i was who i am now., i would have done it if i were., i'd be, it would probably have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have been, but i mean, i could, i don't know if i could have done anything else., things as they were, i mean, it's, it's possible uh, i mean obviously, yeah, because i mean, that's what i'm doing., i mean, i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until, until it makes me crazy, i stay on things, um, and it's like every little detail that comes, i suddenly remember and it can just throw me away for a whole day i still mean, i'm still getting, i'm still getting really uncomfortable and barricaded and then ashamed of things i did in high school, that was years ago and years ago i shouldn't even think about it because it's in the past, but i still get the feeling that i'm right there, well, it's not, just i've been trying to figure out how to deal with it i mean with him for a long time through, by drinking and you know, just try to slow down my mind this way, but since the medications it's better, it wasn't impossible to deal with, it wasn't easy, but it's, but it's been better, like i said, i'm doing a lot, do you know when i write or when i do something like i almost have to do it?, do two things at once to completely occupy my brain, when i see t v, i have to play a game on my phone when i use the computer, i have to be., you know, a t v show or a movie about you know, in another window, so i just, keep my mind busy during all this, um, i just need, i mean,, i wish i could just let the thoughts come and deal with them, but i just can't yet, they're triggered by everything., pretty much everything i see when i, if i, when i hear someone with a dutch last name, when i hear someone talking about wisconsin, when i hear that you know people are talking about it., only, everything you know, i can get back and connect, to, to this it is really it is really, i don't know that this is the thing i mean, i never get a break, from him, yeah, that's good., um, i don't know that i'm a very light sleeper, so i.., awake and sleep and awake and sleep <asl> i have no problem sleeping again but i generally, you know you don't know., i don't know that i never really needed much sleep., it's just recently that i've really started to like the effects of not feeling enough sleep, as i would usually stay up to two or three in the morning so i could just be so exhausted that i could just wake up the next day and feel good going to work, but now it's like i can't, that i still can't get enough sleep, i don't think i'm still sleeping very easily., you know, i get up and turn around all night., you know it and now, it's just, it's, yeah, i'm not sleeping too well now., um, pretty i mean, i don't know, it's hard, it's hard to know, i usually just some kind of power through them and just, i'm how i am now, i just feel, bad, um, i think, about three three four years ago, um, it was when i, i had given to take things for fear for, for, years before, but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you really did., this, situation and we need you to work on the medications you are not you need to like on these new medications that actually start, even you and heal yourself a little bit of all this, so yes, that was kind of a turning point, but unfortunately, it happened after everything went wrong., i don't know., the moment i don't know that i don't really think i thought about it, too much then, but looking back at it, i feel, it really makes me, angry it makes me really you know where i am right now it makes me really angry that i am, that i had to lose everything because, for, chemicals in my brain for things i couldn't control, and that you know that the people who were supposed to help me didn't help me, i mean, i paid, i paid a lot of money to go to doctors, and they did, and they knew it wasn't., it didn't help, it didn't work until, until, you know, i found someone who worked and i'm just yes, so i'm like thank you guys for the help, but, it was a little bit late now, um, there was really no choice i had to be i was i was a mess i was, it was either, i was meditating myself it influenced my work i mean it was all just at a point where i really realized that i meant i just had to do this differently, but again it was too late because you know, then my review came a few months later and you know, after, after all, after having institutionalized one or two times and all the stuff you know they just decided that i just didn't worth it so they let me go, but it was at least, that and not, fires me, but yes, but that's how i got help, but it was, but it wasn't early enough, uh not, not as much as i should, um, i'm going to a couple, meetings, i'm going to a a so that i, to know you also keep control of this aspect <t> and there is one aspect of therapy that, unfortunately, you know you're unemployed., my unemployment ran out of you know i'm you know i'm my meds from the city l a so, you know, i'm not really able to see money, someone, so i have a psychiatrist i see, but it's really, very, i only saw her three times last year., it's basically to let my medications come, and then there's you <laughter>, right, like i said, i mean, just the speech <tah> i mean, the ones we just take the a a for example, because that's probably the next <cloth> closest for what i see with the therapy for now, just to say what's silent is just.., how to get this stuff out, try to figure out how to make this mess in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and phrases that make sense, with which you can actually deal, is a big step like, regardless of who , you tell me if it's a therapist or just a room full of drunks, you know, i mean, you take all this, things that really killed you, and you make it something that you can handle something that you can write down what you can do., talk about in contrast to just let it sit there only as this formless thing, yeah, that's good., um, you know better than me when i was., it's kind of, it goes <g> it has its ups and downs, i'm applying for a job., five six jobs, or more a day you know and never get an answer that never gets an interview, never get any closer, to be self sufficient again, um, it's hard, but that's like real world problems i feel, how the chemical parts get under control, how the depression gets under control, so now it's just i have to deal with the real life, that's, it just has its own it's just its own challenge, yeah, that's good., um, it was probably you know a few years ago, um, i was, i mean the thing that comes to mind right away, uh, is, everything went well at my job i made these great videos with this person i had a relationship with and we were really close, we had fun together, and we went out and got a christmas tree, and, we spent all the time choosing the perfect christmas tree and it was just, feeling like a part of someone's life, and feel like part of the larger, the greater life, that's the one out there that you know how normal people feel, you know for this moment that i felt like, a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl he really liked and, you know everything went well and, i mean, it didn't go really well because it was all messed up, but for that moment i felt like a normal person, a normal happy person, and, part of what makes it so difficult now is to know that, i don't know if i'll ever feel that again., so, um, probably the, this is likely to be the, education <educary> education series i got uh, a pedagogical, uh video series i did for the national science foundation, um, it was, it was really hard and it was, but in the end it became really good and, you know, i hope it helps a lot of kids, and it helps the world get kids excited about science, and.., and about the world around it, so i felt that this was a real contribution i made to, the world, oh, it was part of you that it was part of my job., it was a, we tried to come with, with new ideas uh, because we'd be together videos and things you know, to schools and everything and they had done before, but we decided to do something really big, you know, and there were a lot of trips, and there were a lot of trips around, and there was a lot to him and so, it was probably the biggest, project that the n s f had decided to do and so we just produced it somehow, right, that doesn't yeah, um, i guess.., i don't know <laughter> uh, i don't know, it's been a while since i've really been thinking that i don't know, would i go somewhere i, i don't know., thank you.",19

365,"sure, i'm doing alright, new jersey, yes, three months ago, not very often, uh it's much different, uh, i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here, to start a new life for myself, it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh, it was uh, it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here, i've met some good friends here, um, you know i love the hollywood area um, and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love, hmm, the traffic, not really no i don't, just haven't had the time or the finances to, digital media, well, i've always loved you know, <deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it, no, i dropped out, well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that, uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education, um, but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my, degree in digital media, and uh you know finished, and uh started working you know doing something in that field, a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but, i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but, i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing, listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um, you know play music in my car and that helps me relax, or i smoke a cigarette, oh like what ooh um <laughter>, just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal, well <sigh>, it depends on, how high my stress level is and how angry i am, but i, i do my best to, not get so pissed off <laughter>, , and, i don't know she um, she wanted me to to come and pick her up, uh she was a little drunk, and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and, i just ended not picking her up, because of her attitude on the phone with me, yeah, it does, something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids, uh often, or as often as i should, i've just been so busy with trying to, get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to, you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to, you have no idea, um, it's it comes natural but it's no way easy, and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do, but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away, and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a, and i feel bad that i don't see them you know, but, the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them, fear, you know, fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear, that, something awful is gonna happen, and, not seeing them it, brings about that fear a lot more, you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it, it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida, um, and i i at least i used to see them, it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all, and, that's the that's the hardest thing i've had, to do as a parent, is to, step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for, i don't know what my future holds, but, the hardest thing is being, so far away from them, just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day, and they just cheer me right up, i mean, i eh, it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away, and just not seeing their faces that's, it's it's the worst thing ever you know, but, i, i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face, and um, i don't know, well um, i think, the fact that i can, get down to their level, um, i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter>, as a father than my dad was with me my dad was, you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but, you know he was always very reserved, you know, and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because, you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy, um, but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be, but, i always love to, you know play around with them, as much as possible, you know not, i don't want them to grow up too fast, and that that may have been, yeah, well <sigh>, a situation that i wish i would've handled differently, there's so many <laughter>, uh, i guess when i was still with my ex-wife, in florida, i wish i wouldn't have, gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions, she had a tendency to, get underneath my skin, and uh you know, keep picking at me until, i exploded, and, i allowed her to do that, you know i i should've just, walked away when i could, and um you know not let my temper get the best of me, no, no, no, uh sometimes it's hard, um, sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through, with work and you know, making sure, you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent, you know wondering what my kids are going through, you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore, if they even know they have a father, you know, those are some of the things that run through my head and, and that keeps me up at night sometimes, a little <sigh> but <sigh>, you know i put myself in this situation so, you know i i gotta, bear with it you know i gotta, you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh>, i gotta deal with it in my own way, lately, um, i've been trying to, not think so much about, you know all that's going into my life, uh i try to distract myself, and that kind of, gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or, just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know, all the stresses in my life, um, the last time i felt really happy, uh, was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um, with a couple of my friends from work and um, i don't know, we just got, pretty drunk and just <laughter>, that kinda helped me to forget, all the crap that was, previously going through my head, so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that, other stuff, then i'm happy <sigh>, some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter>, um, uh i'm kind of like a, i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends, you know, i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting, or i may, um you know just listen to people so you know eh, i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something, troubling times like like i'm going through, , uh who lives in florida, you know i talk to him every now and then and, he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and, you know i just kind of, talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to, you know when i was living in florida, i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me, and now that i'm here in l_a, i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so, he um, he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice, you know about what i think you know he should do, um, so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that, uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff, i don't know <sigh> um, sometimes i wish i wasn't so, kind or generous, it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me, and i may not realize it, and um, i don't like saying no to people i like, to always please people, so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser, sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it, you know, help others and not you know, that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to, pay bills but, i feel better helping people, i don't know, i regret, not, breaking up with my ex-wife sooner, i regret <re> i regret <re>, because she put me through so much crap in my life, and um, i was always trying to, be a people pleaser i was trying to please her, you know trying to, please my kids as much as i can, by not breaking up you know the family, but, you know there's only so much one person can take, and i i think probably if i would've left sooner, i may have been happier, and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did, you know, during all those years with her, so, maybe if i would've got out sooner, i don't know i would've been happier i guess, um, it's okay to be selfish, it's okay to, you know, think about yourself sometimes, you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you, then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy, and even though, pleasing people may make you happy, uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs, because, you know, you play an important role, in, the lives of your close family members, and um, in order to keep everything afloat, you sometimes gotta gotta worry about the one person that's, you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so, be a little selfish sometimes it's okay, i don't even know what a weekend is anymore, my ideal weekend would be, locked away alone in my room, watching movies listening to music just, with my, cell phone off and, not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar, you know or you know watching a a metal show, so, i like to be alone, but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people, crazy <laughter>, he thinks i'm uh, i'm crazy for coming out here, but, i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded, and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter, how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out, so, i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight, but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm, crazy but, strong-minded <laughter>, my kids <sigh>, you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy, are my kids and, you know just having them in my life is is the, proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them, in my life, and although i don't get to see them as much, even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know, how far they've gone, you know, what what they've accomplished in their you know, in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy, and i can't wait to see them again, one of my most memorable experiences, i guess that would be, , in florida, you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch, it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget, just because we'd been looking forward to it for you know so many months and, you know when it finally happened it was surreal, um, it was it was a great night after all and overall, sure you're welcome, bye",12
440,", yes, i'm fine, thank you., i was born in east los angeles., and, yes, to explore the freedom to outdoors, and with different, weather temperature < temp> you know with weather < clears throat>, temperature, and climate for skiing or, to the beach maybe on the same day, i like that., um, mm i probably think the overcrowding, and the smog, mm not often, but i have, meeting with other people and learning about their environment and cultures, the last trip i made outside of here was to italy., and, that was my second time to be there, and, i enjoyed it more this time., because, i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and.., and i was better prepared, for, italians and their culture i felt, i wasn't like you know i was better prepared, i thought, for this trip, <freezes the neck>, that would be, to be in the country and see a very small house, in the middle of, hectares and hectares and hectares of grapes were only, magnificent, human development, i didn't decide to do that., started the school with the intention of being a lactation consultant, and i went to a program, in which you get a degree as well as your license to become a lactation consultant, and through the process i learned that i had to do a long internship without paying and at the time <t> and i miss, i had one family, so i had to make another career choice fast, and so the college offered, human development as an important, and i.., just walked right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already purchased, on this particular important and, and i'm happy with it, currently no i stay at home i have a little, well, he's not so small that i'm ready to get back to work., um, in the meantime i design jewelry, well, i've got three, children around i have an almost four year old and then i have two older children, seventeen and twenty three, no, so that your children are the love of them and for them unconditionally, all the steps they go through are stages all the time., for each age < slaughter>, and then everyone in my household is different because they are different ages, so, i think i'm probably more in line with these different levels, that's why it drives me crazy., um, and i think my parents were parents back when my parents were,, it was just like, you know she's fed, she's dressed., she has a house, i mean a roof over her head, and we do it great as parents and we love them and so, it wasn't about there wasn't too much i felt the parents thought about, that in terms of education in this way and as you know today, there are books for every age, every year month, you know, throws out and rounds out. , so i think it's different in this way, monstrous, very close, empty the throat , outward, mm, i don't feel uninhibited., i, feel a little, you know, confident to talk to people, i'll probably talk., more than i have to < laughter>, lets the neck clear let the neck open let the neck open let the neck open , i'm designing jewelry, i'm doing it to relax., i'm pretty good at it., well, i think i.., try not to, not to feel or let others know what my feelings are, when i'm angry, that's not good., because if i don't do anything with them, i know it'll come out sometime., and, yes, it is., this is something i have to work on., like training or something like that, it was my husband and it was about, um, he asked me if i ever thought of cheating in our marriage, of him, uh really tired to talk about the same subject, um, now it came from < f> from, a client of my husband, who is a woman, and she told him that she had cheated on her husband for a year because she had upset him., many things, and around <free throat>, and so he took this information and came home, and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what, think of fraud and, he knows i upset him., and that made me feel like it made me cheat or thought about cheating, < emptied the throat> and around <sigh>, we've talked a lot., and uh i don't just mean that, but, i don't just know about fraud in general, and all the more so i just said what i, usually says that i don't, um, and that i, have thought about it when we were together for the first time, and uh but it was just a thought, and, um, and then his answer was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell each other, and that just kind of, <sigh> i guess i'm irritated i was really disturbed by that, and i was just thinking you know we're having this conversation again., and why do we have this conversation <laughter>, you are the one who cheats and so it is, the, went to, that.., argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> screaming i mean it was part entertainment and part sms, to <sigh>, don't speak, <laughter> at all, to <sigh>, mm, almost every situation that affects my children and when i screamed, because i really don't like, when i got to the point where i screamed more, it bothers me because, i was yelled at., much, and i just, feel bad about it and i, try really hard to not, any kind of situation that affects my children, no matter how excited i get, and lead to scream, hmm, that would be likely to keep, pregnancy or not, yeah, that's good., yeah, i know., i didn't talk about it until yesterday., and, oh, i was pregnant and, i didn't want to be married and i wanted to be married, and i just.., didn't think it was the right time for me, and, i had, pretty much made my decision that i wouldn't keep this pregnancy, but i've made the decision myself, and when my partner found out uh that i was pregnant, he said he wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me, and so this decision was pretty hard, because i felt obliged to do so, and felt super guilty to not, and, <drops microphone> oops, and uh, this is correct to, hang on this earpiece falls, that's where we're going., that was probably the hardest decision you actually know what no, i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i've ever had to make, i'm sorry the hardest decision i've had to make, was in my life whether or not < clear throat>, the hospital was supposed to kill life., or a life support machine for my father, or not, that was the hardest decision, because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that, and to have been, to draw on the situation in which he was, not able to do anything at all, either speak, for itself, was beyond, who he was and i just couldn't see him, like that more and he would be a vegetable that i was told, so i agreed, to track that, not, hardly ever, < slaughter>, too many things are going around my head, and pretty much around, mostly on weekends because my older children are traveling with their friends, even if i, i know they're coming, i mean, i'm worried all the time., uh, how they are when they come home and so i really can't sleep on weekends most of the time, but.., and you sometimes it's just so many days not a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> i faint, but it's hard, very stressed, my son is.., it has been, uh in dealing with some legal issues, and um is currently imprisoned, and uh, it was really hard., yeah, i was probably very short., moody irritable, well, i often think of many things that don't even happen <laughter>, my mind just goes from one, point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there, you know., it's interesting., nope., no, yes, about three years ago, for my, about o b g, proposal, i don't know., see a psychiatrist, yes, well, um.., i've been, in the process of change of therapists, so it is about, because the program i was in, um, appropriations lost, and i lost my therapist, or the therapist i worked with and so it has been, approx. two months, maybe three now, and um but i noticed when i was in therapy, that it was just a complicated part of my, my life my week too, to my therapist, um, it really helped me., management, um, when i picked up my son., when he was released, from to, prison, um, a go getter uh probably know you uh she would use the term hucker but meaning, that i, i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs, do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know, legally natural, um, outward, maybe sometimes even a little for going out for them, um, and, compassionate, sensitive, loyal, mm, all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter>, the screaming was one., um, only the little things that, drove me so crazy that i could see myself., to do them and it bothers me very much, about what, mm, empty the throat , um, not too much really i don't know, empty the throat , to go to college right after high school, and do not wait, um, and <sigh>, that i didn't really have to be in a relationship to be happy, or that you do not need to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and, do not be in a relationship and still be happy and, life, um, what did i do?, mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good, yeah, that's good., i was glad he was safe., um, my children, and uh, my services, in order, school and work, see you.",19
410,"yes, today is my daughter's birthday., california, yes, around the beach, i love the water, the violence of the gangs, violence, i've lost a lot of friends growing up., around through primary school and high school, only to lose them through gang violence, yes, thank you very much., it was pretty hard out there <laughter>, um, hasn't been to any place in california yet, so not really., i'm an optician and a certified optician., and i also have the degree of my employee, uh, actually, i went in., i didn't really know what i was going to do when i first applied, i only knew that i wanted to change my life and do something successful, before i settled down and you know that my daughter and everything, to actually my consultant somehow helped me and i, i always thought they were so cool because their white long lab coats, to be an optometrist, because i'm already an optician and that's like the first step, and what i'm asking why is a good question because, then i would be able to have my own business, and i would have something to leave successfully to my daughter, and she wouldn't really have to want something, it would be like a, a family business, but an a to help the community as well, and something i could leave for my daughter, my daughter is five years old., she's going to primary school next week., and today is her birthday five years ago i had her <laughter> around her is, i taught her at home that i taught her for five years, and.., she's adorable, she's my heart., no, that's like the hardest job ever., it's very hard., provided, provision of uh ensure that , they wash their clothes because i mean it's hard enough., to be a parent, but i'm a young parent and, i'm a little more mature than her father., it's.., it's the deployment part i would basically say to make sure you need everything they need, it's so, complicated, let alone.., it gives you enthusiasm to be more to walk the extra mile around, even being here today would probably have been in bed, but today's my daughter's party., and i've tried whatever extra little money i could make you know to, make sure they have a good day so, it's all about going the extra mile., to do everything you can to provide <pro> for them, but it is a very hard work, um, the moment of the day, when your child tells you how much she cares for you, and, my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and, how many, i mean, just call your name it, it's a sense of reality., to be called mother or to call dad and, it's just like it's in love with you, it also lets you know what this reality is, that's my life, that's what i'm living now, and, it is a very good feeling that is the best part of being a parent, thank you., um, many different things i actually am, take care of my daughter <laughter>, i'm here with her., i was raised by my grandparents., i mean, i didn't really learn that i wasn't my mother until i was sixteen and, my father, i mean, i couldn't point him out., on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is, i can feel it., i'm very different from her, because, no matter how hard the job i always don't give up, yeah, that's good., um, i guess i, there were a lot of different people who were very positive., in my life i can say, my sister had a good influence on me to get into the medical field., she's in the uh she's a l v a, she's one of my older sisters., i can say , i believe in god, being in my life god has to be in my life, also keep my strength and know that i do not have to take over this world alone, because god is there for me and, um, hm, i don't know., i don't really look up to a lot of different people because, people lie like that, and that's the best i could think that was positive for me, i think i'm going out <laughter> i used to be shy, get up as a child, and, i don't know what happened to me., one day i just broke out of my bowl and, i was.., very accurate, shows my personality of <laughter>, um, i really like it, for, to collapse the waves against the rocks on the beach, and i like to just sit there, and all the others who are there, just turn them off, and rub my toes in the sand, and that's so relaxing, um, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, excuse me for apologizing., i've learned not to do it because it's a form of knowing who's in control and it's your life or someone else., and i feel my temper is controlling my temperament, shows that i am responsible for my life, so i don't even let things come to me, i don't even really remember the last time i had to control my temper, because that's how much i'm trying to, negativity, mm probably my husband < yawn>, my daughter's father.., uh probably about how uh you know the dishes or how the little things, but not uh, physical confrontation as with another person no, wow, to be honest,, i feel somehow guilty, about how things like uh basically ended up like things, before my mother died, i wish that, i could have done it., helped her a little more, even if people say i shouldn't feel bad, because she wasn't really there for me when i grew up., but i feel guilty, as you know., not to be there as much as i could have been for her, before she died., i think this is something i still feel guilty for., um, passes through my mother, um, i felt like.., basically, that, it was i felt somehow, robbed in one sense, as i felt that everyone had other parents and, i grew up with my grandparents and then, for me to go so many years without really knowing mom and dad, to be 18 years old for me and then she leaves me, it was kind of like, i don't know it was annoying, because, i felt, you know it was., i didn't have them all these years and then now that i'm older and i don't even have them now, so, um, signing the newspaper with a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter, i was so nervous, so scared., to really not know what to do, how to take it, and i mean, it's so scary, it was the safest way to bring my daughter into this world., yes, it's hard <laughter> i didn't even sleep last night, that's why i'm yawning, but.., i tend to,, try to do everything and i have to get, back to the stage in which, i have to think about myself, too., and give me time, uh, a little like that., but actually i'm a little nicer today <laughter>, um, only groggy, um, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, lately i felt very confident, on the need to make a positive contribution to to the, the extra mile of being a good parent, uh, yeah, i really don't care what other people think., i've always been bothered with it, but not anymore., no, no, um, today, because, i was so happy that i was, my daughter into this world today on her birthday, to meet people, mhm mm at the moment not, when i go, uh to see who i associate with, my weight <laughter>, uh, i'd say my grandma, mm, um, um.., it's just.., i'd rather not., for my daughter, this is my pride and joy, wow, thank you., see you.",12

409,"okay, mm, okay, sure, mm, doing okay, i'm from uh l_a, yeah, i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment, yeah, uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag, and um, i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas, i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh, it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it, but uh overall it's okay, uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>, that's why that's my that was my major yeah, um, i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh, it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the, in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um, you didn't see you know too many computers around back then, and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together, you know solving a, a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the, the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um, the problem, mhm, uh, no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time, um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di>, uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um, the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was, i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it, to the degree that i wanted to, wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh, well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time, this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um, at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing, job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much, too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know, i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel, fulfillment on but i don't wanna, too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice, relaxing job, yeah <laughter>, yeah, oh i would say, well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing, um but, i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more, vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much, like once the funny gates open up they kind of, open up too much so i have to like back off you know, but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor, oh really <laughter>, yeah <laughter>, oh um, well i listen to music um, i'll um well i watch t_v um, i'll um, just what what do i do to relax, well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too, i'll be around an area, around, kind of a comfort area where i, i feel safe i can just, dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my, thinking about my own, problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus, on being in the moment with my um, acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances, um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem, it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode, i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more, had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh, uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going, yeah, wow that's a good question, um, i'm not sure to be honest um, i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that, it's not really part of my repertoire, um nothing comes to mind off top of my head, well, um, well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments, back about ten years ago, i was more um, i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people, like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field, and um, i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it, and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity, and um unfortunately i made some bad, financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad, position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up, so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions, that i really regret, wow, hmm, that's a tough one, i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter>, okay, oh, well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um, it's just me and my uncle, and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um, he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida, so uh we're we're okay, but um, uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um, we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep, and uh he's got his own problems, so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation, and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have, so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel, i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in, um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem, and um, i have, a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom, and um, so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a, long story short <laughter>, um, it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired, or achy, so it is it is difficult, uh <sigh>, well i've been feeling okay i mean um, i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um, i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't, taken uh responsibility for, but um, i feel a bit of calmness as of late, no, well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um, i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h, the minnesota multifaceted, personality something of whether, this is going back about six months ago, they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my, my well being psychologically too and i think some of the, the answers said that they, advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, i didn't follow that, up on that because, of philosophical differences, but uh i think i might have a you know, a mild case of depression, well you know um, like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh, i'm doing okay but i you know i, kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my, my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone, i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to, and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh, there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties, so um, you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to, wow, that's a good one <laughter>, really happy um, let me think about that a minute, well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth>, okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer, um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow, it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh, we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters, giving out really nice samples, it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a, and um, you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like, have me experience their product or service, and um, i was around people that, i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh, i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh, about a month ago, yeah, yeah it was, best friend, i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh, i would say um, hmm, i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh, i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>, um, i i like to be conscientious i, you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall, i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know, say little white lies or you know, i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic, um, i tend to be, pretty calm for the most part, um, what do i regret, well can you elaborate that <laughter>, uh well um, i just well just overall um, i regret uh, not being a little more assertive in in my earlier, uh earlier life um, and kinda put myself in this position, it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life, i made some bad decisions and unfortunately, i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like, sort of like, living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing, so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all, well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um, i think, i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice, i was kinda going away from, my basic, beingness you know like the way i really felt, like for example i'd make i would do aggressive, uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been, well off for the rest of my life <laughter>, but unfortunately it went the opposite way, too too many eggs in that basket, so i kinda regretted going with, my gut feeling and and let other people influence me, and uh, 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments, in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some, aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much, kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret, yeah, wow, that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter>, <laughter> well, i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually, you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows, but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um, you know i'd like to, go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game, uh go to a movie, go out with some friends, so i would just or you know just kinda kick back, but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on, you know earning earning money on the weekends, uh, that's interesting, most proud of, um, i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really, bad, bad uh, vice, um, you know i, i lived a pretty wholesome <wholeso> wholesome life i'd say that'd probably, i don't know if it's really proud um, but as but as far as i stayed the course as far as, uh not going down any real deep <laughter> alleys so to speak, okay, my pleasure, bye now, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, nan,

318,"yes, i'm fine., los engeles california, yes, no,, there's always something going on around the lights of the city, the traffic and that's it, uh business administration and business administration, not that i'm doing something else that i'm networking right now, <sigh>, hmm, to open a large clothing line and simply provide the whole world with clothes <laughter>, yeah, that's good., definitely, uh , because i'm all about myself it's all about me <laughter>, not often, but more times than not yeah, to be lied to and i guess when people think you're dumber than you are than what you are <laughter>, try to go away from everything in my own room, very good, i'm great in controlling my temperament, <sigh>, i'm probably like two days ago <laughter> and it was probably just about some sports it wasn't a real argument, <sharp inhalation> not much, but i travel enough, only able to see <s> to get a change of pace to see someone new seeing new faces new environment, mm let me see the last trip i had was vegas you know how vegas goes it was pretty funny, it was a lot, lotta drink and a lot of parties go to <laughter>, um, pretty open minded i'm kind to pretty much everyone i'm a, pretty straight kiel guy, it's okay, it could be better., no, no ma'am., yes, no, it's been pretty hard lately, i guess, 'cause i stayed up so late, but.., this is my fault <laughter>, i don't know, i guess i'm a night owl, and suddenly i become an owl., sluggish and tired all day when i don't sleep well all day i'm just lying around, not too much, mm none < slaughter>, oh stay focused and listen to the adult <laughter>, yeah, that's good., i mean, it's self explanatory, i could have just listened to parents or other adults trying to steer you in the right direction and, you know you're a stubborn boy, at such an age, so it's like, what are you talking about i this is my life i can do what i want i don't have to listen to you, but now i see that what they told me was right, um, hilarious, < slaughter>, pretty close, both my parents mother and father, mm recently, what have i done, at new year's eve party i had the time of my life it was so funny, i was at a party at a friend's house in the baldwin hills area on the eve of this new year., he had it in a pretty nice house it's a three storey house and it was like, three hundred fifty people in there it was pretty funny, but it wasn't that funny either, because there were so many people and you couldn't really move like that., that was the only downfall, but besides, i brought my new year in big with tons of friends and, that's how it's supposed to be done., i'm usually in good mood every day i wake up brings me in good mood i think you could say that, but, um, i don't know a good meal <laughter>, <makes clicking sounds with mouth> ooh one of my most memorable experiences were probably, when i was younger, i was with the scouts and we camped all the time and a year we went to, yellowstone or yosemite one of these places and we had to work on a mountain bike merit badge and, of course i'm out of town like a mountain bike i can ride a mountain bike, but, once we got in the real mountains on real mountain bikes, i won a new respect for the mountain bikers it was nice it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about forty five miles per hour in dirt on a bike was pretty intense and that was i'll never forget that, i don't know that it's hard to answer what i'm most proud of., i don't know., see you.",3
483,", safe, < slaughter>, mm, all right, i guess., new orleans louisiana, two thousand five., i went back a lot, but not much more., uh, just something happened., uh <laughter>, all right., guess you're not programmed with that knowledge, but uh katrina happened in two thousand five, not really, um, where do i start?, um, only l a is different cultural, i have a different culture out here., it's just another place, it's bike friendly., louisiana is not, new orleans for this matter is really not, now they're trying to be, but it's just not so successful, the drivers are crazy., mm not really somehow, but not much more, didn't you break the money somehow <laughter>, only able to go on an adventure, um, let's see, i once went on a bike to comic con like on a tricycle, um, and that was pretty funny., kind of scary and dangerous, almost killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>, travel or just in general, hmm, um, i have to say , i have to say, we were, we were on our way out to, we had, from the p c h and goes into, leguna, and laguna has this really steep hill and on sunday it is full of traffic, and i remember going down, the hill and my brakes didn't work and i tried to hit my brakes and try to hit my brakes and they just wouldn't click, and i was like oh god, and i'm on a tricycle bike, so i'm taller than most bikes and i'm like circling between like grid lock traffic, going down a hill, non brakeable, and i'm going down, and suddenly, there is this car that is directly in mm veers essentially where i try to go, so i, rotate, strong, before this bus and this truck and literally at the end go sideways through the traffic through incoming traffic, and then loop <laughter> back into the right traffic through incoming traffic, still without brakes, and how not to keep my bike from, rolling that's painful when your bike rolling somehow hurts a lot, so yes., yeah, that's it., < slaughter>, um, various things uh anthropology visual effects, kind of weird, but yes., um, i always had a fascination for film, and, i think the way people do things and do things is fascinating., just like the mob mentality of the people, special, oh, dream job, um, what are you doing?, i have no idea., just one job, i guess, i see myself as an outbound, um, you know, i've never been afraid of what people think of me., like people i i like people i don't know, i'm not, i'm not afraid of what they think, i'm more worried like the people i know and what they think of me., i guess being out like that is just not really, influence me, eh, um, , um, yes reading books i like reading and drawing books, read the books drawing play video games, have i thought of something have i forgotten all sleep, i like to sleep, it's fun., uh <mumble> not good, <laughter> common <laughter>, um, <sigh>, uh, in high school, i pushed someone's head through a locker., um, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's not good, never push anyone's head into a locker., this is a good way to be suspended, um, i don't know., yes things like this only, always in fights, <sigh>, um, like a serious argument, to <sigh>, uh, i guess how, , argument about, about, um, uh i think about how uh like views on how weapons control, and arms control laws, i mean,, it was like, last night, oh, that's it., it was an argument that you know gun control scheme i mean it doesn't really affect me personally, but that was like the last argument i came into, that's kind of what you said, i think., ooh, um, all my life.., <laughs> uh <mumbling> <sigh>, i've been, um, on, two years ago i broke up, with how everyone calls her my evil ex, and, yeah, it was just so bad that the whole thing went wrong, i mean,, uh, eh, i think i've calmed down a lot since then., like a person as a whole, but i mean, i was angry and so i think that i like on my bike for like, hundreds of miles more in a unique day, and i was in a ton of pain, for example , later in the evening i came home i was like oh god, it's like i can barely walk., and yes, i think i'm running away and, as on a like extreme cycling spree was not good, but it was better than how, too much food and like, only, overeating because i was depressed, but yes how we fought and shouted and it was not good as if i did not fight physically, it was more like a screaming match of death, , um, i don't think i had a unique hard decision., i've ever had to do, because, my biggest thing, in life, you don't know you don't regret it., i don't regret it., the things you do, i just regret the opportunities you missed, and that's like you had to come with me., that was how i had to learn that in the past like two years, like two years ago, i just couldn't understand this concept, and to answer your question, i'm thinking about thinking, the hardest decision i had to make, is, i'd say , likely, likely to break with my ex probably, um, <sigh> ooh, around <sigh> where do i start, <sigh>, um, my ex was not a good person just in any form or form of the word, she did a few things i didn't feel quite comfortable with., only to the people around them and to me, and, i, < deep breath>, <laughter> you know, they say you should forgive people., to do for mistakes or things, and i just think there are some things that people can't forgive., no matter how hard you try, and i think there are some things that are done once, that it can't be, andone they're just they're the way they're, and i think, i'm thinking about what she did., i just like , eh, things just fall apart after it's just us, mm despite us try, it just didn't work., i mean,, i don't know that i don't really want to talk about exactly what happened., oh, god, what are you doing?, oh, man., to delete from my memory or just to delete from ever happen, um, i don't know, you know that's hard., um, katrina, only the experience of katrina for the beginning, my ex , i guess it's kind of tough between the two of them, i'd rather lean towards katrina., 'cause that was just that it wasn't, i mean, i guess you don't know exactly, but.., in two thousand five around, uh this huge storm hit, uh, new orleans louisiana to kill a whole bunch of people, levelled the city, um, and, i lost a lot of friends during the storm, um, i mean, i kind of get over it, but, it's still, it's still there., and i think, i don't know, i mean, you can try and look you can try your best and find something positive, but nothing is the only thing., what you can do, is <i>, just think it was like a freak accident and it's never gonna happen again, but <laughter> i live in l a and you know, <laughter> earthquake, <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think, oh i'd rather, do you rather know it's coming than not knowing it's coming?, yes, <laughter> yeah, <sigh> um, mm depression repeats several times, it's not a surprise., the first time i was diagnosed was in middle school., that would be.., <sigh> ten a good twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years, i don't know , i don't know when i was in sixth grade, that's, it's when the first time i was told i was depressed, um, as far as p t s d goes, to go to katrina, um, and then, you know, i'm just.., post katrina mostly < laughter> that was the big deal, um, i guess that had been previously diagnosed as being depressed and still in high school, it was kind of not that i wasn't really looking for help, it's kind of that i was kind of coming to my high school., and they were like here's help because we know you're gonna need it, um, and i was like oh good, thanks for not really asking for it, but okay, i'll take it., um, you know, it just happened somehow., no not not anymore, um, eh, <sigh>, <laughter> that's a good question about <laughter>, you know i really don't know., i guess it kind of stopped, just kind of was how good i'm not gonna do that anymore, sometimes, sometimes it's the way you feel today., and so and so, you know, it's kind of good, i feel good right now, but, ask me in two hours and who knows, you know, um, <sigh>, i guess.., it has helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen, and just keep walking and moving with your life, um, mm essentially only, mm how to continue you know, things will go on, <sigh>, um, wow <laughter> around, um, i was.., i was hanging out with my girlfriend., hanging out, um, good for the beginning i mean, you can't, i just went for a walk with a stick because i was recently hit by a car., and i'd make my leg better, um, let's see, the stick's over there., in this way but still around <sigh>, i don't know., uh make me less fat, < slaughter>, um, i would make it so that i would not feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day., because if you sleep more than ten hours a day, it's just unproductive that you're wasting too much time., how i have friends who like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like you do, i need to sleep like 12 hours to feel good., how you can sleep six, you know, as in in crunch time you know that you're with four i have to go with, seven, or eight, you know, for example , this is my crunch time sleep plan eight hours, it's just, i don't know, i'm sleeping, but i like sleeping, too., i mean,, yeah, it's just the sleepy part i don't like., um, <sigh>, um, completely crazy in a good way, completely crazy in a good way, um, uh, i guess,, how they would also, say how you know, there are times when i could seem like an asshole and i'm not really an asshole i'm just, you know, i'm just having problems like everyone else., in particular, i have, asperger is a kind of autism., that makes life simply fantastic, you'd also say i'm extravagant and eccentric, 'cause it's totally me, i just.., i don't know., i think i'm still alive, so i should live because i'm still alive, and you know, who knows how long i'll be alive, so i should know, live while i live and only, go out and do things and not, do not sit and be calm, except when i read, and i like to read, <sigh>, um, stop fucking with me, no, it's kind of messed up., um, i think, i would have told myself then., um, because i knew., my evil ex, i've known her since i was six and she was five., i think ten years ago, i would have grabbed my shoulders and said that you see this girl, whatever you do if you're not with the girl., don't trust her that she can't be trusted., and more importantly , don't, don't leave your guard around her, because she'll exploit it., and i mean how physically don't leave your guard mentally, um, yeah don't date here just don't do it's not worth it < laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain, it's not worth it., the fact that i'm still alive, maybe, yeah, that's good., uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of this pretty proud that i managed to do it, um, only, i don't know, i don't really know that i don't really use the term pride., i don't feel really proud., i'm just it's more like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>, i don't know if that makes me humble or just crazy, who knows?, i now press the button, goodbye., all right.",15
469,"<synch>, yes, i'm okay, l_a, mm, uh there's a lot of variety um there's a lot of health-oriented stuff um, there's all kinds of food to eat you can go to the desert you can go to the you can go anywhere i mean there's a lot, and the weather's great, the traffic um, lately the change in weather it's kind of a little too unpredictable, but it mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people, uh i wouldn't say a lot just um occasionally, uh it's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe i wouldn't normally do different people um, learning about different people different customs um, depends i mean if it's a water real pretty water and you know being in beautiful water um, relaxing, adventure i love adventure, uh <laughter> uh some time ago i went to cayman islands and um, went on i get seasick but my sister gave me some medication and i went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and i accidentally got back on the wrong boat, um, yeah and um they're really crazy they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat <laughter>, and i thought i was gonna drown 'cause the water was kinda rough i was really shocked they they wanted me to do that, yeah but i survived <laughter>, yeah pretty good, uh business management, but also, also hypnotherapy, i didn't hear that other question, um, well i came from a serious kinda family so that just seems something that would be universal that would cover a lot of different subjects, yes, yeah but um yes and no i mean now i kinda wish it was something different, um i like communication i love speaking and interviewing strangers um, i'm very outgoing um and funny so, probably would've been something more like either liberal arts communication that type of thing, uh dream job would just be out there you know like some of these people maybe on t_v exploring different places and getting paid for it and eh always like a fun adventure, uh interacting with people, um doing things i haven't done before, and um, helping people, you know on some way with what i do that they can see you know, that i'm uncoordinated and in some ways and you know they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too <laughter>, uh i watch t_v i go work out um i go walking i recently got like a a bike that i kinda sort of fixed up, um go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping, interact with friends call them see them, that type of thing, talk to strangers, um, depends on the situation there's a bunch of times i'm good at it, um if it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me it's a little tougher, or people who are like really rude you know with the way they cut you off, almost <laughter> um, luckily not, you know i'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes where if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot i'll, i'll confront them on that sometimes, um, might've been with my sister um, it had to do with um i'm not sure of the topic but um whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it it sounds childish about who was right you know 'cause she thinks she's always the smarter one 'cause she's older, uh sometimes it's frustrating 'cause it's like it's a no win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody 'til you know they acknowledge that she's right, um other times i just let it go and let her rattle on 'cause it's, it's kinda nonproductive, uh i'm real close to i see my parents almost every weekend um more close to my mother um, i have a twin sister, i stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and i've got two other sisters so i stay in touch with, all of 'em, you know it's a mixed bag you know um, we kinda have assertive aggressiveness in us a little bit, <sigh>, but also, um, well me <laughter> um and um, ever i mean strangers sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me um, strangers have been, very um sometimes unexpectedly very nice, uh i could be shopping and um you know i'm, maybe i can't reach something and some guy'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out um, uh that type of thing or um, if somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody'll like, commiserate <laughter> you know and um, , um, i had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me um 'cause he thought i, didn't like his dog it was you know i'm not crazy about dogs but um he kinda flipped out for a year and a half and um, just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around um i wish i'd confronted that back then, because i, you know but it created a lot of anxiety for me 'cause i feel like i could've nipped it in the bud and to instead of having to deal with the um, major stress from it, now he and i don't talk at all i just feel it's best he's kind of odd, hmm, god there's been a lot, um, sometimes breaking up with somebody or um, <sigh>, yeah it's usually or getting rid of a friend, that type of thing, um, sometimes i feel guilty about, some of my past behavior with people um, where maybe i wasn't as understanding um, eh <sigh> when i was younger i stole things you know that's not the best behavior and um, and it's stuff like that, oh god there's a lot of 'em um, i wish i could erase you know how um, tough my dad was on us as children, and um, erase a lot of memories of men i dated that just didn't work out well at all, and um, yeah, i can drop off like, right away, yeah, cranky <laughter> irritated um, snarky <laughter>, um, a bit out of sorts um i've had some anxiety uh with money um and relationships 'cause i haven't been in one for so long, male <laughter> um, just a lot of anxiety um, mm yeah, <sigh> take a deep breath um, try and do positive things you know sometimes, um eat healthier work out more um talk to my friend about it, that type of thing, try and look for interesting activities to do, to distract me, <sniffle>, well not officially but i know <sigh> you know from, mm things i've experienced that i've had <ha> i've you know i get very anxious in certain situations, um yeah uh it's usually triggered by um, sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me um if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally, uh or sometimes if they're too much in my space <s> my uh space you know where i am it bothers me, um yeah a long time ago, it was ages ago, maybe over ten years ago, fifteen years ago, um, i was depressed <laughter> i mean i <laughter> know that's nothing to laugh about but i mean it's kinda, in a circle um, just, to um, wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more, um, feeling stuck in certain thoughts um having a lot of negative thoughts um feeling of hopelessness helplessness, that type of thing, , um, i go occasionally it's a different type um, i'll go see a hypnotherapist um sometimes to release <rel> release <rel> release anxiety that's in me, yes i do very useful, um, a lot more awareness of myself and other people um, learning more control more confidence um better self-esteem um willing to try, even more things you know whether i know the outcome or not you know of the unknown i'll experiment a lot more, , um, helping like at the twenty fifth mile handing out water and there were some people there who were doing that for the first time also, some event at my sister's where there were just a couple of us and um, i was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes i'm like really funny you know and i can't even believe myself you know i just go on and on, you know and everyone starts laughing i'm not even trying to and i'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny and laugh <sniffle> yeah that, um as a really decent loyal uh empathetic um, deserving, um, supportive i'm hoping <laughter> um, outgoing quirky, type of person, um, well it'd be great to uh look even younger uh or be younger, if that was humanly possible <laughter> um, be even more patient with people, i think um you know not get frustrated like if i think somebody's not very smart, uh sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people, whoa um <laughter>, uh <sigh> wow, make a lot of money and plan for your future, um, and, try and be as kind and patient with people as possible

368,"yeah i'm okay with it, um i'm okay i'm okay um, i guess, , i'm basically an l_a kinda guy, cool, um, you know the weather it's usually pretty sunny and and temperate you know i like the the climate really a lot, uh i like the girls here you know um, i like uh let's see i don't like the traffic you know but, um i like the hispanic population quite a bit you know um, and i have a lot of friends here so i guess you know i don't wanna be anywhere else, i mean like i said the traffic you know i was on the four o five you know that's always kinda you know crummy, the cost of living that's really you know terrible about l_a it's always expensive, and um, you know i really don't like, <sigh> i really don't like you know the the, like it just seems like um l_a's one of those places where like you're you know you either have like a a you know a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you're down in the you know the ghettos you know, i have i've been to a couple places um, uh you know but very brief you know mostly it was for school, um i went to arizona and new york and montana lot of the anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that, um nothing i'm doing in right now, uh i like getting away from um <laughter> the city you know i was in yosemite last year you know in the summer for vacation that was kinda nice you know yosemite was really um, really neat to see but uh just basically getting away from the city i guess you know getting away from the job getting away from um the stress here, uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics um, i'm a big kind of a political you know junkie you know to begin with so i naturally kinda fell in line with that kinda field of study, i was i was but i lost my job, and you know that's kind of a bummer you know um i lost it's uh, geez, it's already been maybe a year and a half by now maybe two years and, um, you know the economy uh got bad and the budget cuts got bad, and you know um i wish i was working there again, uh, well i um wanted to be a lawyer at one time i wanted to be a lawyer and i um, and that's why i took political science and i took a double major in economics, and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i i regret is i eh you know to get into law school you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats, and i studied for it like really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the test and like a idiot um i didn't feel right about the that day it was kind of an off day, and you know it was like you know the big game at the superbowl you <y> you know i just um i don't <do> i don't feel like i did well and i canceled the test and so um, you know i kinda regret that you know, <laughter> tell me about it, um i'm not really shy at all i'm definitely not shy um, but outgoing i mean not one of these people <peo> i'm not flamboyent you know um i i'll talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind, um meeting <mee> meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like i'm you know dying to to dying to meet anybody <laughter> you know <laughter>, i guess, um these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar, um, uh yeah thank you thank you i you know i i should've i should actually be doing more of it, but i also like to exercise um uh i'm on a diet right now but my diet's been terrible time the eating habits have been terrible, but the exercise part is just great i love to exercise <exerci> i love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is like run and like work out, um i just wish that my eating habits were were in line uh or a little bit better you know, um <sigh> my temper could be you know definitely improved uh a lot you know um, you know a lotta times i i feel i'm one of these introvert types persons when it comes to like you know i don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever, when uh when i'm mad i really don't wanna be you know talking to people i don't like to yell i don't like to scream i don't like to hit i don't like to fight i kinda close down a lot i don't i just wanna be left alone, sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be, you know uh the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe i you know i just don't i just don't wanna talk about it <laughter> i just don't wanna deal with it, i kinda close down and shut you know, shut off for a little bit, geez, um, you know it doesn't happen too often, maybe with my wife, you know we were probably something silly who knows, who knows, um, the, thing i i mean i don't have a lotta guilt i don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know um, there are things that like you know um i call minor sins, you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty, um, let's see i guess, sometimes you know um, you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to, you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but, sometimes i like to like, talk to people i guess, you know, well that's a good question, i guess, i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently, i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that, and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like, get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do, you know um, and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way, well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way, which is kinda nice, um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly, um, uh she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control, you know she doesn't control it and like it like uh it affects her health and it always has me worried about her and like stressing out about her and and she could do so much to like prevent it and she doesn't and, um you know i have a good relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think, i think i have a ton <to> ton of of family and friends um, that get along with me pretty well actually you know, yeah, um <sigh> there are times well i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby, um the only problem i have, i think, is i feel, like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you you're just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh it's like a falling sensation or something like that, and it doesn't happen eh that often but it happens, and um but for the most time <ti> part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good, well right now generally i've been feeling um, worried and and anxious and um, you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today, well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her, but um, you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good, and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too, and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like, and um, a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess, well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate, so, um, you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower, all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way, i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just, more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not, you know um working towards you know the goals, you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um, you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem, like, <laughter> like i wanna like uh, do any of these like terrible jobs, i it's you know it's it's, probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um, you know one of these things is like uh, i feel like um it is hard, but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it, you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it, and like uh you know, it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry, i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with, no, no, man, uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe, i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like, not even happy about that you know i feel like um, you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that, it just makes me feel good, you know so i i have these these, these times where i'm just you know feeling good, about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and, and uh you know, incredible that you know um it just eh, you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times, you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes, you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know, well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes, who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh, i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can, like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know, that if i got my you know diet in check um, you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um, my <m> my, my uh, i guess my my, desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad, and like things are so um rough that, you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like, it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like, to um <laughter>, <sigh> do things, the one thing i regret is is not, is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um, you know, not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like, you know just to um, just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh, i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like, like uh, i mean there is a this idea of justice and, and um and republicanism, and you know things that i really you know adhere to, that um i fall in love with, and that i don't wanna get away from, but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money, and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that, that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like, like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome, ugh <sigh>, i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe, um, you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i, you know regret on one hand on the other hand, you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about, and you know, i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid, i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that, i think that real people have you know, um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like, i'm pretty happy and content with, being you know the cautious you know, uh, i don't know, oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night, and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family, feel that i don't put a lot of, time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my, time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really, you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different, i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real, you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it, you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they, you know, if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor, i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness, i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like, i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um, you know uh, like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends, but it's the same time i i just feel like it's, it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a, a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know, gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me, and i you know so i just do these things you know just, um well there are a couple a things that i do like uh that i've good <go> i feel good about myself you know, um you know i ran the l_a marathon that kinda feels good you know, i've graduated from college that kinda feels good you know what i mean but the thing is i don't feel like, like that proud of myself, for you know those things alone like graduating from college, you know hasn't really made me successful you know what i mean, um, running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim, so they're like half merits, you know or like they're they're great you know lotta people maybe not half done it a lotta people have excelled further, but um, you know they're kinda like stepping stones that like, that um i've seal real new no, life <l> lifelong, benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that i've done, yeah yeah no problem no problem thank you for your time you know um hope you enjoy you know uh being in this computer, oh goodbye, i'm gonna press this

give them the mm to give them the trust and motivation they need in life, because many of them don't understand., when i see people really do things they really shouldn't do, uh.., i mean really bothers me and when people, talk to you, they'll give you the round, it's like you're not just being honest with me, instead of just giving me the round, you're not just going to be honest with me, this can be very frustrating, uh and really, if people really do, i'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <laughter> that really messed up me, uh spray painting on the wall, uh, only, throw

upset, uh i'm really upset i'm really starting to lure people out, to be honest with you, and it's something that's not really me, but i'm learning, really let it know a lot of you, only you know, just say hey, that's the way it is, it's like i'm not in control i can't control it, yes i just have to control things about what i do and really get upset by what other people do is not really good, it's not good for me., oh my temperament can be controlled i can control it pretty well, uh , i don't know that it was probably my sister., and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life

good, yes, up and down, you know?, up because i'm motivated to come out and start doing other things in life than just doing nothing at all, and then other times where you want to achieve something and you can't really do it because there are roadblocks in the way, but uh, i'm learning how to overcome these roadblocks., uh , good for example, uh looking to go to school and i had trouble getting uh enrolled in school, i talked to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me go online and do it, so i'm like okay it's good it's going to be done <laughter>, yeah, that's good., um, can you repeat that again, ma'am?, oh, yes, i did., saw i had to be, uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh, i noticed that by certain situations like you i talked about the anger situation it's as if i wasn't angry all the time, that's not me, so sometimes when i get angry, i need to figure out what causes all this, what causes me to get angry, and i have to take, excuse me, ma'am., it's not hard at all, because all you have to do is take your time and think about everything you've been through, and take a close look at the situation and, uh.., and then go from there and find out what is what really bothers you, it is very rare, uh i suffer from p t s d and uh get this kind of sleep, would be great, because i have recurring nightmares, so of an incident like this, <sigh>, i think it's and i don't know what it's triggering, but i think it's and that's why i'm talking to someone or someone because i'm a veteran, at the uh v a about the situation now, about the p t s d at the moment, excuse me, ma'am., uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares many problems many anger problems uh depression, i've noticed all this in me and uh, i started telling myself i needed help., and that's basically it, i just know, i just know that i was something not wrong with him something wasn't right with me, and if something's wrong with me, i have to take some time to look at myself well and ask myself if something's right, if something's right, then that's fine, if something's wrong, then you have to take care of it., and uh i just started looking for help down there yes, something yes, it's something, because i can sit down and talk to the therapist., well, i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and tell them my situation, and we're usually going to go through the problem., and uh, i went to class to talk to my doctor, so it helps me a little., yeah, that's good., it's a good thing., excuse me, ma'am., no, no, not really., my best friend, she would describe me as a funny loving good person always there trying to help others uh, think more of others really than of myself, but if i know i have to do things for myself, i'll take care of it., so you know it, and they really look up to me, they have a lot more respect for me., yes, they see something in me, they wish that they, excuse me, ma'am., uh you can be a little more specific, oh, all right., uh books crossword puzzle, walk, that's it., i thought i did, but i don't think i regret anything because, that's what it is, this is the way it is to me, so i accept it and i move on, because if i regret something in the past, then i'm wasting my time on it because it's gone, that's the past i have to move on, i have to live in the present so that i can be prepared for the future so that i can go into the future., yeah, that's good., <sharp inhalation>, uh <sigh> more education uh, i am more direct and trusting in what i do, as i am today, so yes, that was what i was missing about twenty years ago, uh yes <ye> yes i had been a lot of positive people in my life, uh.., yes some people would uh uh well consistent <cons> i mean consistently motivating me, a certain goal to pursue and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot, and uh, he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things, because all you do is make a choice, it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that the choice is still to be done on you for it, excuse me, ma'am., uh.., that i am able to really be motivated myself, and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things that i thought i couldn't, but it can be achieved, when i'm ready to put the will to do it, oh wow huh, oh really and you know what i really enjoyed, sat with my social worker and we talk about doing things in my life., and school was one of them uh, and just school was one of them and i liked it because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me, yes and i thought that was a great thing as long as you're ready to do that, i'm ready to even go the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school, and yes, that and that and that get me going, oh it's and i love it and uh that will be achieved, thank you., goodbye.",11

373,"yes, uh doing okay doing okay, uh north carolina, yep, uh almost four years ago, um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since, yep, uh probably three <th>, at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there, mhm, um uh it's, l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and, seeing some friends um but um i i feel more, i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home, uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh, i the <th> i like the resources there i like feeling um, i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be, in north carolina so it i feel like i'm uh, uh i'm able to uh pursue, eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina, uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um, resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston, so uh it's not the worst but um, uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably, drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but, i can't really change geography, uh, <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production, uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer, um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the, uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could, make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now, i do um i love traveling i try to uh, go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently, and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so, mhm, uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you, uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and, knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or, and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to, just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created, uh yeah sure i went to uh, barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out, and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks, and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i, mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world, i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing, even virtual people, oop, i lost ya, um to relax i uh, listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to, go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy, cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh, sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh, um uh pretty simple tastes, yep, this is awkward isn't, um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can, kinda formulate how i feel and why i'm feeling that way and what, i want to be done about it so uh so it's pretty, i guess i'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect, <sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like, uh misremembering when uh, something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled, uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like, trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person, thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged, uh i guess in the classical sense of the word, um <sigh>, i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um, um i just recently did a uh uh a project, like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it, uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was, doing to her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um, uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um, but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let, uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so, just my thoughts there, hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh>, uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh, ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh, break up with her after some stuff happened and, um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to, uh to uh, break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh, uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory, ugh just, a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so, uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um, i uh, yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now, um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help, but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or, um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very, big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh, uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i, if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so, um, uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um, uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next, um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little, um, uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh, um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of, the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a, group of people or or company um, carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee, how do i cope with, them um, i assume you mean i guess, uh, people i work with how do i cope with the, uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to, how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and, you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the, uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it, then uh it's progress right, uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh, um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check, throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to, follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel, um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that, uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling, uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh, and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself, but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist, uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all, had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or, cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a, a symptom so um, uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression, uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh, um, i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and, i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good, good work especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly, and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that, uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so, oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't, you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis, um <sigh>, i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh, uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me, and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very, kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child, i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to, um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh, um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of, you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with, uh the man he is, <psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six, um, uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old, but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where, so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so, i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control, how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so, uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i, um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid, depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh, i'm low and uh i treat it as such and, i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i, i have a i'm a i'm a pretty, like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i, mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and, i'm just a smoking gun of, sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh, um i don't i don't lose sight of uh, the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so, mm, um i was on a my uh, my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um, yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh, um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and, then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like, lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have, someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right, um, <sigh> i guess for i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh, i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care, uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and, i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them, and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm, probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have, thanks ellie, bye",9

403,"yes, i'm doing really well., i'm from granada hill california it's around the san fernando valley a part of los angeles, i love the weather i like the variety in people i like how to go to a neighborhood and it's just not just a race or, type of food i love the beaches, all the activities you could go to do theme parks, aquarium stuff like these museums, the smog, um, there are a lot of creepy guys <laughter>, i've travelled pretty much l a i was across the country and back three times twice when i was seventeen, i like meeting new people and trying out different foods and seeing how other people live, when i was seventeen, i ran away with my friend to take new york to watertown., like a naval army type of city, we had an apartment there it has snowed a lot, we sold antiques for a living, to get passports press passports for the sunset strip music festival by a friend, and meet rock stars and hang out like the private parties, i am very extraordinary i love people, i go to the gym and learn a little, i think it helps relieve stress and, keeps my energy level going i realized <rea> noticed when i wasn't a few days i feel a little tired than normal and, it just helps me feel good, i'm pretty good at i'm very quiet around i worked a lot of events and, jobs where you have to talk to thousands of people a day and people, and you have to stay calm and, you know they're the customers, so you need to make them feel wanted and, good and realize that you are being paid because the money they spend is so, i'm good at solving <reso> like consumer conflicts and things on the job, i had a drunk friend who just, falling around screaming and saying rude things to people and i somehowa, she started to get loud, like she was just telling her to stop, and that she was intimidating, and what she said to people was very mean that you knew., and i wonder if you're talking to people like that., they may not like it and they might attack you or something you know you never know it's l a., i really don't feel guilty about any decisions i made in my life., think i've made really good decisions and i always stick to my moral compass, what i do, i grew up in church so, i haven't left in years, but i still have these values and, you know the rules of the ten commandments and things in my head, i had a slum lord landlord and.., i wish i'd called you to know the right authorities and, he's been through a court trial instead of chasing him out like me because it wasn't after the code., i, a few years ago, i was with a guy, and he wanted me to move back where he came from., and after a few months you know that he came to l a and went home, decided to move there and i had just started, you know that this business i did was going to pick up event planning and i decided to leave there, and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work, but, it was hard to decide how i should leave l a and do this, jump and follow something new and experience something new or stay in what i did, i was i had a degree in dental assistance i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i studied communication, such as radio and television broadcasting and journalism, i do event work and wrote for a magazine for a few years and i try to like it., get a site going and then have how where i write my own and what's going on instead, you know you write for someone else, i always wanted to write and was always growing up in the news and music and art i really like connie chung, she was like a channel four newscasters in the eighties and i love barbara walters, i was a nerd, not a laugh., my sister doesn't talk to the family., and i have a good relationship with my mother, i never knew my father didn't mind me., i have cousins and stuff, but everyone is scattered across the country so i don't really talk to them on the phone we only communicate on facebook or like twitter, oh, i'm going to sleep right, when i get tired, i just go to sleep, pretty well energetic i have motivated to go for more event work you know event planning things and look for, really grinding in more than i was, i mean, it's kind of hard because you have to talk to people and get them to trust you and, see that you plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event as someone else, no, no, i mean, i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens to someone getting cancer or someone i know dies, i wouldn't say that i just, super like oh my god happy all the time, but it's like a straight, kiel that i feel pretty good all the time, i am very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to them quietly and, i could adapt to different situations and even if i'm not my scene, or situation or group of people i'm used to that i could still jump into, talk to people and feel comfortable and find friends and adapt, i want to make more money <laughter>, i remember as in the second grade that these people made fun of me because i was very tall and thin and i was like, just a's one of the highest grades in the class so, people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or, such things, very talkative she would just say that i'm talking to everyone, and that i'm very friendly and if you need help, i'm helping someone you know, oh recently i went to the ocean and visited a friend i've known for years and, we just went to the burger and hung on the beach and, we got her two year old son and took him to the park and played and, it was really nice and it was cool to visit her, i hadn't seen her in six months and, it was really funny and i want to go back and, i like the area, mhm, i, maybe i could try to find my own work more like for my business, instead of working for other people, i think i'm following it, but i think maybe i could put a little more time in it a day, i don't really know anything like, that i want to delete or don't happen, no, i feel good about my decisions i've made and i think i'm on the right track and, a lot of things i wanted to do, then balls roll and i'll always <g> you know i'll do things i'm not as big as i want to be, but i feel like i'm on my way there, as i did ten years ago, i would have told myself to work more a day instead of as much as i was., my friend, whom we call mojo, um mojo has a magazine and i have just written years and, he really urges me to like to continue writing and continue to hold events and keep on the ball i roll and, he's one of the biggest people you know in my life and tells me you're talented., you could do it you know he's just a real, good as motivation for me, you know i was on t v shows and started my own event thing., i have a lot of people who read what i write every day and follow on i just think it's a you know it's not exactly where i want to be, but it's a great start, and i worked to get to this point, thank you.",0
424,"hi, yes, today is a wonderful day i just do absolutely wonderful, i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to go narrowes when i was sixteen years old, yes, i've only been back once since i left., it's a completely different one, community, when i grew up i am so glad that i grew up there because it was a great feeling of community that i think we're not going to be in los anles <sniffle>, my grandmother died and left property for my father., so we came here to manage their property., it was pretty easy for me to be young., and it was easy to adapt, so i'm pretty good at meeting people, so uh, that's never been a problem that i traveled a lot as a kid, so i was used to moving and going to new places, meeting new people, seeing new things, it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life, oh, one of my best trips i've had was in, nineteen i am with myself, but nineteen sixty four < sniffle> i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland, ohio and i went to an indian reservation, and i got a little note card about the reservation when i came home, i wrote to the reservation and i told them when i came back <ca> went back to school in september i would have to write, uh, a talk rather about what i did in the summer and i told them i wanted to,, to talk about going to the indian reservation and they would send me something and they sent me this, large, kachina indian doll, and that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth it now, if i still had it, i found out like a quarter of a million dollars so, mm, but this is one of the best , i could be a little bit of both., i'm pretty when i have to be, i can be walking because i'm good at meeting people and meeting people, but sometimes i have a little bashful side, a little shy side of me too, so a little bit of both, i studied business administration <ad> administration with a focus on marketing and advertising, well, i really started in computer science, but that was when computer science wasn't what it is today., and around me i liked <li> i was good at it, but it wasn't interaction with people and i love people, so i wanted something that would bring me, interaction with people, so i went into marketing, and i worked for a t v station where i go to school so that in line in marketing advertising fit so, no, now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer i shoot many stars, i shoot on the red carpet, i shoot a lot of special events and everything else people pay me for <laughter>, it's not hard at all, it's my passion, i love it, it's like not working, i'm in my dream job, i just need to get more., jobs <j> jobs pay me well, because there are many times as a photographer that you have to do many things <thin> to get events known for free, so it's a process of building relationships, so i'm still in this process of building relationships, so i can get more paid jobs, but this is my dream job i love, what i do, well, now i'm really back in it i've got it for a while, then i got away from it, but it's meditation, i practice meditation and try to do it twice a day in the morning, and the night before i go to sleep, i work with oprah and deepak chockera and everyone else who provides me with meditation and i use that to, calm down my body, i can generally control my temperament, sometimes i get hired, i think like any other human person <per> being, but i'm working on trying to keep a moderate and moderate, uh temperament in the personality, oh wow we i argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i didn't want to say it hurt her, but it has obviously, and we argued about what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt them mm and maybe what i said did, and that's what the argument started, oh god, i felt terrible because i never intended to hurt my daughter, and i'd never want to hurt her, and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said, so i had to guard my words and watch my thoughts, well, i don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away, so it's just my two daughters here with me, and we have a pretty good relationship you know we're trying to work my daughter is a make up artist and i'm a photographer, so we work a lot together in the industry so, sometimes i think we're too close., we need a little more space, yes, if i say the wrong things <laughter>, no, it's never easy to be a parent, it's a job in work, sometimes making the right decisions, love the feeling of consummation, that you could educate the highest creation on this planet, to be a, uh wonderful and productive person, i'm not as strict as my parents, i give my children a little more freedom to find out who they are, i'm not really religious as they do, but i'm very spiritual, so i raised her differently from myself on the religious tip., and, i'm more i listen to her more i think than what my parents did it was, you were to be seen and not to be heard when i grew up and i let my children's voice hear, one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know that i want to go into details, i feel bad about that night <laughter>, yes, i could have stayed at home <laughter>, wow i'm trying to think about a situation, maybe dealing with how i and my husband divorced i think i could have treated this a little differently, we really loved each other very much and it was just something that made a, an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive, and i think we both could have done better, but i think i've played a part in keeping a lot of drama going., because i was hurt, we broke up and somehow ravaged, because i wanted my child to be raised with her father., so i think it's looking back now, what you know, that the review is twenty two visions., i could have handled things a little better, but what can you do if you knew better?, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, the hardest decision i've ever had to make was that i was on my way to work on a plane when a enrollment consultant had a stroke., wanted to establish a connection, and, to get into the other plane and then go to the hospital and a doctor sat behind me, and he told me, that i couldn't get on the plane, because i could have another stroke that was a tough decision because i was all alone in dallas texas., i didn't mean that i was in there with an employee, but i would be left alone because my employees had to go on., to montgomery alabama, where we went, and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go, but my life was in balance, so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital, but that was a tough one., ugh overwhelmed i mean here i'm on my way to work you know, i flew to different states every week, and uh to help get kids admitted to college and here i'm on my way to work, and i'm on a plane and i feel this, strange feeling coming across the left side of my body, and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get out of the plane, i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment that i did every week, so i knew something was wrong, it was when you came into your life., and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next, so it was very disturbing, very traumatic, and i know you don't know what's happening to you, it's the weirdest thing you're riding to., the hospital in a, medical ambulance, that was a strange experience., yeah, but i'm here., i know i survived, the doctor told me no one survived a stroke on a plane and i survived so, the universe wasn't finished with me yet, you know what that is, sometimes i have a little problem with it., sleep a little sometimes i, i'm wired <laughter> i'm wired just because i'm one of those real energetic people and i have to finish what i was going to do and until i'm done i can't go to sleep, so sometimes it's hard for me to sleep other times i can lie down and just walk, but depends on what's going on in my head, i'm sluggish., probably a little at the edge, but i'm trying to keep a happy personality i'm a real energetic person, so i'm trying, but you know, when you're tired, your body's still talking to you., so, lately i felt really good, except, i ate something., problems because i've had one since i had the stroke, i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke, but i thought it would have gotten a little better now and it's not but i'm so grateful to be alive., that this is really small <mi> small compared to the larger picture and i wasn't, fortunately <for> luckily, i have not lost my facial structure or, you know, my face isn't messed up, how many people are, i can still use my hands, which i can still shoot with my camera, although my left hand in use is diminished., but i can shoot as a photographer with my right hand so i can still do my job, so you know i have to hold a good blow, energy goes on for me to keep being successful for me, no, but i've been through depression., i was beaten unconscious five times when i was a teacher., every ball there was that you could call football baseball basketball names, the ball hit me in my head and i suffered from, how to have sleep apnea and cannot sleep, so often to be hit and knocked unconscious in the head, so, no, just i'm not going to therapy because, i don't have medicine right now, so i can't get therapy that they only offer people with medicine., it's hard to get it < sniffle> and then i don't work < work> yes it sucks i don't work now because i'm still trying to get my disability, so that i, get healthy, because i want to be a fulfilled person and i want to be total and you know the system will take almost two years before i go to a hearing., so that's kind of depressing, to think after all the years i've worked since i was sixteen and it takes me, it's been over a year, it's been a year, i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i will not be hearing by september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i, getting the disability or not, that was very depressing for me because i wonder where i lived from my savings last year, and i brought my daughter through college, she's done and now she has to take care of me and she's still looking for a job, and my life is kind of in the air right now, 'cause i wonder what's next, so i'm just praying for leadership., i feel happy every day i wake up, and i can breathe and i can see, and i can go and i can talk and i can still shoot my photo i'm glad it's just a good thing, to be alive and alive in the present moment, you know what i thought, like what are good regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change here and now, so just go forward live <li>, what advice would i give myself < sniffle> let nothing in your way, you know that you keep a good personality and an energetic mind and just push on, energetically talkative, uh won't take no for an answer uh follow by reliable, good spirited, lovingly give, i'm very proud of it., i could find out my creative side, i was a visual artist, i've never taken an art lesson., i taught art < sniffle> around i was, in my late twenties, before i even discovered that i could draw and paint, i'm a doll collector, i am my creative side, which i am most proud of because it was able to help me., being creative i can do no matter what, even though i was still very sick of a stroke i could still walk, and just go take pictures and that was so, reassuring for my soul, that i am i am glad that i have a creative side and that i have found it and have used it, mhm, uh huh, and that's that it's good bye, see you.",3
325,"yes, um i'm fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human, um i was born i was born in l_a i was raised out in the suburbs um i've lived all over los angeles i've lived in the valley long beach and now i'm in culver city, um, there's great food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow, there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people uh i think that's really great , that is a much longer list i would like to get out of here um the, the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too , i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology, i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it , everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling> , um i think maybe, managing a um managing a research, you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to, something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that, it's a hard question to answer <laughter>, i do, um, i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world, well i traveled for eight months in central america, um and i visited a lot of different countries i, um i went scuba diving, i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up, vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter>, i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um, to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control , <laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting, getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um, we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight, um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people , i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh, couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground, yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i, seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge , i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend, um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal , i think i'm just proud of who i am i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm, i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself , a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that, <laughter>, no i have not, no, yes, i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago , yes, um i was cutting and my, one of my best friends called, um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um, it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help, i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks , <laughter>, uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back, lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and, my routine of go to school, and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit , weird finding out what to do with my, finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um, depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california , almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um, about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep , sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep, um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i, i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um, i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile, probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens , uh <makes sound with mouth>, really happy i mean um, i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's, really happy on new year's eve which was um, uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them, i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life, i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults, um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and, i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn , uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really, amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this, uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in, something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this , cave system um and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so , that was that was pretty good <laughter> , i'm trying to remember that at the moment i haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school um <laughter> so uh i guess reading hiking um, just being together with my friends doing um, relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking playing with my cat, not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but um you know i'm still here so can't be that bad, hmm, um, i don't know hang in there um hold on to your clothes 'cause the nineties are coming back in fashion, hmm, um cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets being in um being out in nature, kind of being away from the hubub of the city getting a good grade <laughter>, i think my boyfriend has he's just um especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's , really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say um to <t> so to see someone overcome that , uh really inspired me , okay",10
310,"yeah, it's okay., <laughter> all right, < slaughter>, i live in hollywood, o sittle, < slaughter>, it's a vague question., <laughter> just needed a change of scenery, uh i like traveling by train, it's not my favorite thing., uh, because i'm not flying, i can't stand planes., i prefer trains, yeah, that's good., < slaughter>, uh, what uh fly on a plane, empty the throat , mm probably december of nineteen eighty six or eighty seven, < slaughter>, < slaughter>, uh, there's nothing much to say, really mean usually i just go from l a to seattle then to vancouver, that's probably the most important thing i do, so took the train, < slaughter>, uh not very often so once every five years or so, so, oh yeah sure absolutely yeah, depends on what it is that i am upset by, could be anything depends on, <laughter> it depends on whether it's uh, a something or someone you know anyway if it's someone i mean i'm not, i'm not physically turned to them, but i mean, i've got < clears throat> depends on what they've done to piss me off i mean i'm certainly not over, you're yelling at me for whatever reason., depends on what you're doing., uh in terms of freaking out at other people physically i don't do that, but to let some aggressions if, if necessary, i don't know about you,, i mean, i'm not trying to hit a wall or punch something nearby., you know, as long as it doesn't physically hurt me, but i know i can just blow off some steam, and that's normal for me., uh <sigh> face to face uh <sigh>, mm, i can't remember it's been a long time., eh, but i mean anyway, but i'm arguing about, with people online about stupid shit yeah and that's normal shit, but as far as face to face you know, it's a long time and, empty the throat , current or total, with whom i mean someone i'm in contact with now, or someone from my past, or what it is, empty the throat , < slaughter>, okay, my mom had a uh uh, a friend when i was a teenager, he was like a father figure when i was about fourteen, so he was a pretty positive influence, < slaughter>, not at all, to open a record store, yeah, that's good., i'm an unemployed office worker right now., < slaughter>, how to do what, be more specific, < slaughter>, <sigh>, on a first date with a girlfriend back in uh two thousand seven when we first met, uh < clears thrombe> just made arrangements to make her and her daughter and her daughter friends with queen mary in long beach and uh, you know, i had to cement the evening to cement the day and evening together, uh hang out and eat dinner and just eat at her hotel and yeah just got to know each other so, yeah, it was., all right., we were that was the beginning of a relationship on the same, so that was so i knew she knew you knew she was my girlfriend at the time so, < slaughter>, so, at the moment yes i do yes, i don't suck eggs, i hate having roommates, it sucks, < slaughter>, <laughter> god <laughter>, mm, in some ways it's okay because they don't see me so often because i'm not really around them and sometimes i have to have my own room., it's difficult for me, but we understand each other, but i don't see them so much, and that's so by design, <cough>, i don't know what to do., i like being alone, sometimes i read, but especially i like being alone, maybe just nothing to do depends on, no, no, empty the throat , no, i'm sorry you're repeating this., not necessarily, empty the throat , very i am a heavy sleeper, empty the throat , i don't know that i would call it, but i'm not necessarily what you'd call it., you know, cheerful, but i don't know that i'm absolutely down, yeah, that's good., yeah, all the time., <sigh>, uh, it's hard to say, i don't know, i uh, i'm not sure., empty the throat , i don't know that i'm really one who has to ask you, i think you have to ask someone else that you know i have a difficult time answering that question., < slaughter>, proud of, that i didn't do it, did not fall into drugs like many other people i know, yeah, that's good., hmm, <clear throat> listen to music on vinyl, to be around dogs, mm, uh spent new year's eve with a friend really close friend, so, <laughter> not really <laughter>, < slaughter>, < slaughter>, < slaughter>, i'm glad i don't have any, i think they're especially here in los angeles, they drive me crazy, i can't stand them., empty the throat , uh, i assume you mean post high school.., uh, in short, just uh, what did i take?, general studies i from what i remember i have not actually finished i have quit uh, go on., to play in a band, so i skipped a lot of school, so i didn't really <laughter>, so nothing uh, it was a junior college or community college, so it wasn't me going to university, so i was just.., do what, stop walking., i was just not interested <laughter> my interests were somewhere else, so i just stopped going you know it so, in relation to what, oh sure everyone has regrets about something that you know i'm not going to get specific, but yeah sure i'm < laughter> there are things i'm sure i regret, empty the throat , mm, twenty years ago, what was that?, ninety three, mm, good ten years ago uh, two thousand and three, it's hard to say, it's hard to say, will have to come back to this maybe, oh, i don't have a best friend these days., < slaughter>, i think it depends on your definition of friend uh i don't uh < clears throat>, i'm not hanging out with too many people you know i had a so called best friend you know, but it was like, no <laughter> twenty years twenty years ago a couple of strange years ago you know that i don't really, i'm a loner these days, so.., i don't really have what you know as a best or really close friend you, anyway i just don't have that, <laughter> okay, i'll see you around., <

456,", yes, thank you., uh boston massachusetts, yes, i moved to l a about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one, often at least a few times a year, around god i love both cities they are polar towards in many ways, but there are things about both of them that i love, uh to act and write, mm it's still not completely reality for me, but it was actually very easy because of the, the creative factor out here allowed me to track what i wanted creatively and, it was different the social culture was different in a way where i had grown up and it fit me better my personality, oh, god, i like the fact that you can come here and track every niche of you, creativity or art or entertainment you want and somehow make your own way, uh i grew up where it snows all the time and is very cold so, sounds obvious, but clearly, i like that it's that you swim all year round and, i like that there's always something to do, no matter what day of the week it is., what i don't like uh good i miss my family <fam> i miss that it's not <no> i don't like that it's not a big family element i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here, but nevertheless it's very easy anyway somehow isolated here, mhm, i can't see your shoes, but i don't usually travel too much to boston and, hmm anyway florida where my parents live, but i enjoy traveling and many trips in california and here, oh, just to have an adventure, to have some fun, or when i go home, that means i'll see my family, empty the throat , to one of my travels mm god good, i like to go to northern california to san francisco i have family and friends there, always super super fun uh in god at college i'm with my college friend, when i was in boston, we went to san francisco and drove to l a and las vegas, so i realized that i wanted to move here, so that was a big one., in general, only, i guess it would move around here that i moved to when i got on a plane but didn't know anyone here., i just talked to a girl i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport., we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the flight was out here, it was big monumental, i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever, mhm, studied communication to get a lot of lots of different uh writing styles i eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and an english minor, writing to follow up the letter, writer uh good i guess you could say writer slash actress who's around, but i guess writing is first, hard, very hard because you need to push no one you will to do it, you have to be self starter, you have to do it, so it's very hard because i don't own that naturally in my personality i do, but not as much as i need to, i would say starting from in general, i <sigh> sometimes take a walk when i feel tense to hear ambient music helps when i need a soothing background white noise, soothing calming area and only, just your basic deep breaths and just take a minute to, to return to a quiet, neutral place, i'm, always better no <laughter> around i'm okay <ok> i'm, good at controlling my temperament, because i don't usually, have a temper too often, but if i and i lose my cool, i have a hard time controlling it, yes, no, <laughter> mm, fighting with someone for, my god!, i guess it was a friend., a friend a girlfriend it, it wasn't about that., our, our individual perspectives on a, a certain situation between us, which, were obviously very different around and it started as something big and then we realized that this, that's stupid, we don't have to argue about it, so it ended quickly., , i guess it would have been with an ex boyfriend struggling with an ex boyfriend relationship stuff that definitely lost my temper and escalated a situation in a way that, it shouldn't have been necessary, i wish i'd just left., mm, i don't know if i could have avoided the whole situation, but i definitely would have, made the result much less, chaotic, hmm, i guess that would be, hmm going away from someone who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh, but that i really wanted in my life and it was a true struggle with morality and, i have to say that i have to do something that's really hard for me to do., type of you know short term pain for long term gain and, i had to make some kind of adult decision relationship wise, but it was still transferred to other areas of my life and taught me that, you know you won't always, feel great <gr> every decision will not always be easy and feel good, yes, i was somehow forced into this problem, just what was going on in life was a way that you can't just ignore these signs., yeah, that's good., i guess it would be a special argument that i had with someone who was random., in some kind of public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could delete that, my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i am completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and, i couldn't ask for a better family, they're, the ideal, i'm sure my parents are just wonderful people who are taught only by example and, i feel like a good mix of both, it's pretty easy, i've been trying lately, it's been a little hard my sleep was out, but for the most part i have, come to realize the meaning of it and it has been quite simple, a bit edgy or fidgety maybe a little out of it i could seem like i'm, in a good mood because i might be a little dizzy and, uh laugh more just type of <laughter> high emotions, but overall get irritated around faster and, just to feel sweating more easy, just feel a little away, i've been feeling pretty good lately, mm not really only, try to be more concentrated < clears throat>, do things, i'm just trying to focus on what i want to do for a living., stop wasting time, or you'll know., simply procrastinating and and get things done and inspired go and see, you know you're with people who do what i want and just carry it into my own life., no, no, oh oh just a few days i was just with my family and my baby niece in florida and, that's why i went down there to see her, so it was just great that i'm always happy when i see her., likely to be considered as very, funny, humor would definitely be one of the first things they would say joke a little, smartass in my personality, but they would describe me as always, uh, unconditionally there for them and just, they know they know i'm there when they always need them., my drive is more driven and only always do things, i guess it would be a new, a new ex boyfriend who was a mistake of a relationship uh, yeah, kind of just, i think because he thought the way he thought about himself certain things he would say and, even if what he said did not directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i even felt with this person, like i'm letting people into my life who shouldn't be there., i'm wrong, and that was terrible., yes i don't regret listening to my gut feelings, don't test yourself., <sigh> <free throat> around big listeners, constant sense of humor, uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all, only people from all age groups racial sex, whatever i just yearn for variety and love, just you know that i'm just me people person, and i.., i start every day with an empty slate, i did some acting work on a series with a really big group of people and it was a very cool creative experience very inspiring, i probably come to i a alone without knowing anyone and staying here and tracking what i want to do., thank you., goodbye.",6
346,"yes, i'm fine., here in los engeles, there are a lot of things to do i love the beach, i love that i love that it's sunny all the time, to the crowd of people, um , this is really the crowd of people, just a little., i just go to new places and discover new things, i was in new york recently, i was there for about three months, um, and it was extremely boring that i went to western new york., it was extremely snowy and.., i wasn't in a position where i didn't have a car, so i couldn't go very many places and i was in a small town, so, um.., i don't know., it was nice for what i got to see, but really, it wasn't really much for him <laughter>, yeah, that's good., um , i'm both an introverter and an extroverter., um , i really enjoy doing things alone, um , i've spent a lot of my own around my preferences and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though i have a lot of friends, and when i go out, i tend to meet a lot of people, but i also enjoy being a lot of myself., um , probably outgoing creative, um , aged, to have fun trustworthy, um , i've studied language around, and physics, and, mathematics, no, i'm not., i'm actually.., i'm trying to be an actress., it was something i fell into when i was a teenager, , and i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it in years., so i figured why i didn't just come back to california and could try so well, something i really like to do, i just got picked up by an agent., so as an adult, i haven't done anything yet, but.., i hope,, in the hope that it will be fruitful, um , i really didn't have too many., um , i guess my sister did really well., um , my friend, he's a, he's a very positive person., um , but.., really i haven't had too many positive influences, um , i'm close, i mean, we're hanging out, i'm not telling them everything., you're kind of judgmental., but.., except i mean, i mean, we're hanging out, i mean, i see her every day, um , oh, my god!, um , it's kind of hard for me to relax, i mean, i'm trying to watch t v, um, and i'm reading, a lot.., that's probably about me reading that i sleep a lot <laughter> i'm a little depressed, so to, yeah, it's kind of , like i said, it's really hard for me to relax, um , it's not that., i tend to think a lot, about the things that emphasize me, i've been through a lot of things, so.., i don't sleep very well at night, and when i fall asleep, i wake up all night, usually with some kind of anxiety attack., um , i dream a lot about the stuff that uh has, influenced me over the years., you usually know how i dream about something that stressed me out and then i wake up and my chest will hurt, um , or just i just can't sleep all night because i think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to sleep, but i.. <sigh>, i just don't know that i feel like this is a vulnerable place for me., because of everything that happened to me., so, um.., so i sleep is just not really something i do well, um , tired, i'm.., i'm moody, i'm very sensitive, um , i'm just negative <ne> a negative person, um, i'm really not., i'm like < l> judgment is not me either, i'm just not a nice person to be here, um , i'm trying to read a lot of time i'm trying to go out and force myself to do things, just to keep myself in touch, so i just sit around and stay on the fact that i can't sleep and i try to make myself as exhausted as possible, to run around and do things, so , it's difficult., i like a part of me that doesn't want to., i don't really want to go out and do things that i have to force myself to do when i have appointments., i make appointments to like for auditions or around, also to do that, i tend to uh, only not, as in the last minute i will try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself anyway, yes, i was diagnosed for two cases., to diagnose i was diagnosed <dia> about three years ago three and a half years ago, and then i was diagnosed again around august, um , the first time it was.., i just didn't sleep because i didn't sleep., and the uh just the stress <st> of incredible stress, um , and then the second time it was a uh again i started sleeping with the not around and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me around, and i just couldn't stand it anymore, so i thought.., i became too gloomy i became like, don't think life was worth it and i that i just had to see someone before something escalated, yeah, that's good., it was, i no <n> not, one of the reasons i went to new york was to try, get out of my surroundings, um, and uh, and that seemed to help a lot, um , and out here i was just the advisors i just didn't really seem to help me much, um, they're just.., they seemed to give me a lot of medication and i don't think that's what i needed, um , yeah, so.., yeah, that's good., <sigh>stressed uh uh lately i was really sad and i don't know why, um , but as i said, i tried to fight this by.., keep me busy, um , in fact,, i'm kind of, a few days ago, i was really really happy and i was really happy, but then i went back to, you know you're going back to the miserable feeling, so, um , well, i realized, i got up in the morning, i really got a good night of sleep, and, i realized i was really happy., because i've been through a lot in my life and i have someone in my life who really loves me and someone who's finally there for me, and uh, you know, he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just very grateful for the, and that made me really happy, um , yeah, that's good., thank you very much <laughter>, oh, god, what are you doing?, um , i've had so many years of just, just bad a lot bad, that it was there a long time ago, since i'm proud of everything, i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through, around my <m> a smaller person i guess would have, got rid of himself a long time ago, but even if i'm really depressed and feel dark and i just feel miserable about many things, there must be a silver lining., so , so, yeah, i mean, i think that's what i'm proud of., i'm still trying to be a good person to try not to be negative to other people, and, and truthfully and i still have to drive inside me, yeah, that's good., so much.., my last marriage, don't come out if i should have, um , and uh just, i regret a lot, <sigh>, the situation that would have a red flag.., you know, some things just don't work., and, no matter how much you try, no matter how much you put in it., i'd tell myself to.., that it is not selfish, let go of a bad situation, and not everyone can be helped, so sometimes you only have to live for yourself and help yourself, , had i known that then i had known that, then i would probably have done better in life, so , yeah, that's good., <sigh>, um, people who, when people fall on me because of my mistakes, that i've done that i have things i've done in my past that people are still alive when i'm trying to forgive myself., people who are mean to other people, uh, people who talk badly about people behind their backs, people who are untrustworthy, um, only anyone looking for the little guy, um , you know people who don't care about the environment or animals, um , i think everyone should be as good as possible., and it's discouraging and it just makes me so angry that people just can't be people who don't let people live, who try to make everyone feel as negative and as bad as they do, and uh i that makes me angry, <laughter> i unraveled <laughter>, yeah, i tend to vent and then uh, and then it's usually over, i'm not trying to mouth bad people, i'm just trying to talk it through until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore, mm, i'm not trying to get angry, because i have a really bad temper, and it's, and it can be out of hand so around, what i do is i <laughter> something makes me so angry i tend to go and take a nap, to <laughter> if i'm not in this situation where i can just take a nap, i usually just walk away from the situation and try to clean up my mind, and come back to him, um , it was a few days ago, it was actually with my mother, it was about, actually, she thought that i had taken a shirt from her, and around her cried out, and cried to me, and round about,, i was tired, i was late., i started screaming <a> back to her you know, because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty, and you <yo> <sigh>, it goes back to my past, you know, when i was younger and you know i didn't care that you knew people's things and i just kind of took and did what i wanted and i'm not that far from that person, it hurt me, so i got angry and i and i started screaming and fighting., mm kind of petty and stupid, but, at the time when it seemed, it seemed uh, viable, um , hmm, one of my most memorable experiences, um , god, i've had so many.., maybe, it was.., i don't know., um , it was, it's probably due to, graduated from pharmacy school, i felt pretty great, i didn't know if i did., uh very good or not uh and i always ended up like on my last test results i always landed <get> like ninety eight percent, and, i don't know., i actually had no confidence that i had done well at school and i didn't even know how to get the grades i got, so that was a really great achievement for me., and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah, yeah, that's good., um , i'm reliable., um , i um , i'm talented., for the, i'm a good listener, um , i'm always here to help people., um , i always try to do the right thing, um , sometimes i forget that i have some good qualities, but, um , and only, i don't know., everywhere i try to be you know how good and the best person i can be for other people and myself, um , yeah, that's good., um , go to comedy shows, um , just.., to have moments in which you just laugh with people, um , sometimes just reading brings me into a good mood, uh , i don't know., maybe it's time., uh huh , all right., thank you., see you.",23
430,", yeah, sure., i'm fine, thank you., i'm from los closeles, well, you can't beat the weather, ahem and, i just think the familiarity of home makes me feel comfortable here, smog, uh, rudeness even though it's not compared to new york, it's, to <laughter> people can be unbearable if they are rude, not as much as i've wanted it lately, that i've traveled more in the past, but not lately., i just think seeing different places, it's.., new things learn, uh, to find things that are fascinating that culminate in my interest, um, let's see., i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was pretty surprised i know it's still only in america, but i just think about, being from l a, i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger, and more uh like say uh ostentatious than new york, but uh, it was quite an experience and i didn't think any place.., i didn't think any place was more dirty than downtown, but i think times < time> i think < battle> times square has hit us, to mention too many i don't even know where to start, suppose it depends on the situation, um, i like walking i like playing to uh i like reading with my dogs uh, uh everything i think i could just leave sitting still and leave my mind empty i know reading requires some concentration, but uh, you just know i don't have to try too hard to relax., <sigh>, in the past i had problems, but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter>, ah probably arguing with my roommate, but a few days ago, uh, that happens, we're friends uh it's a loving argument < laughter> if you, i met this roommate about six seven years ago., um, somehow moved in the same social circles and just got out, it's cool, i mean, i guess you know how, we argue we sometimes have our differences, but there's not one person i'd rather live with than she's cool, hmm, how much time we have, uh <laughter>, it's just too numerous to mention., i don't know how to answer that., i think i'm gonna break up with a friend i really do., cared for but knowing, knowing that it just wouldn't work.., that was very difficult, only weighed pros and cons and only thought, it just didn't want to work., no matter how much love or care i've brought into the relationship, something was missing, and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and, i just knew it was over., no, so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets, but things you delete from your memory, oh, there's way too many, uh, to mention that i don't know how to answer that., the same girl, i broke up with, she was the friend <laughter> of uh a best friend of mine, they were separated for, several years, and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we're not talking i wish uh my regret is i wish i, i could have done better., <scoff>, um, it's funny to see me getting older, i'm not so close, but i still care about her and i still love her and i think they love me, my mom and dad are both alive mm not much interact i'm very close to my older sister, my older sister, um, she's just, strong no nonsense uh, she's short and yet a fireworks body and i've always liked that on her, she uh, uh, she always makes me feel comfortable i'm like another son to her < laughter> in a way, i suppose it depends on my stress level., um, when i have a lot in my mind, i'm having trouble sleeping and uh other times it just, if i really need to sleep, i just need to listen to the radio reading <lis> uh watch t v and finally i'm going to fall tired falling asleep, crabby, i suppose like everyone else.., tired, listless you know all the normal things i suspect when someone doesn't sleep well, i feel good, mm no, i wouldn't say, i've been, no i didn't, yes, i have, i was probably diagnosed with, about five years ago, i think i always knew there was a problem., i always knew there were a few., i think i always knew before i got treatment that, there was a problem emotional and hmm and many things that are very difficult to explain, and i was tired of feeling that way, so i was looking for help, i just think.., lethargy uh, uh no desire to do something uh motivation was just not there, um, thinking, normal depression typing things uh, um, social <socia> i became socially embarrassed, which was a little different for me because i grew up, you know, pretty talkative <laughter>, i know., i'm sorry to say it again., i think it does., well, um, uh, um, uh,, i think the number one thing and that's what i'm amazed at the temperament that i think i've allowed myself to, uh,, retiring from certain situations, and don't take them so seriously, and do not get so tense or angry, and then react, i think it is, it has calmed me down for the most part, now it's like it's becoming a routine, at first it was very difficult, when i was five years old <laughter>, oh, no, if you're a kid, there's nothing really to do., um, there's nothing that could be sad if you're a kid., my best friend, um, i'm not a fool, i have a dry sense of humor, so you know it., my best friend would probably uh, i think the, the jingle back and forth is that you usually know an insult, but you know that everything is in love., i wish i could be taller., i wish i could be more, inclined to play basketball, so i then go to the n b a and a millionaire i know this is all unrealistic, but only honestly answer, hmm, everything i regret, we didn't ask until i mean, so many don't know where to start, mm, that's a good one., wow, um, i don't know., i know that this is a good one i would have, i would have to think about that i wouldn't answer that uh that's a good one, usually you're asked for, what you'd know, how you'd feel in ten twenty years, when i look back, i don't know what advice i'd give myself., something i really enjoyed, um, i love.., there are several things i like to do around uh you know i uh i enjoy playing basketball i i love to watch i love watching all the sports for this matter, which really brings me joy the last couple of years was killing, become a hobby of me is saving dogs to promote dogs and find them houses uh it's <laughter>, i guess it's become a pretty hobby of mine and uh, sometimes i find lost dogs and i am able to find their owner and sometimes i am not so when i tell you what there is nothing <noth>, to find the owner and i found a owner last week for a little dog that i found there is no greater feeling because the man told me <laughter> the man told me how his around, like his daughter, or just cried when she went to give her that she could give him back, that was cool., i think for someone who hasn't finished high school studying in college, and that's something that, i don't know., i'll take, pride even though i don't show it or talk about it often, <laughter> yeah, you look like my friend rachel, it's funny.,

usually i ride bikes everywhere but i was just like walking, this this whole time and, it was cool i was mad exploring, i got um i got back home eventually then after that i went directly to texas, and did some shows on the way going to texas and stayed out there for eight days, and that was <wa> it was it was gnarly it was crazy, i don't even know man it was it's so much happened it was you know i had fun, um i went to this place called the salton sea, and me a bunch of my bicycle friends we um <sniffle>, we got into cars and went way out into the desert and we um, yeah it was tight we

and stuff i got a little fan base, and i'm just always you know just doing that just doing art i draw too, my my dream job is not working a job and being me, that's the dream job getting paid for being me, so that's yeah, i'm pretty good, like two weeks ago i was at this after hours, one i was already like super drunk and two it was after hours, three it was after hours so like, man i had a bunch of pens, these dudes took my pens away <clears throat> pens in my like fanny pack i had like a fanny pack so i had pens in there 'cause i do art, he's like nah dog you can't take this in and i'm like, okay, for sure let me just leave 'em right here and i'll get 'em when i come out and he was like okay, i come out and they're gone, accidentally knock a beer over, and he gets mad at me he's like you gotta go now and i'm like that wasn't my fault that was your fault but then, but then while that happened, my homie was getting like ambushed by these three big old security guards, and then you know when i saw them put hands on my friend that's when i really lost it, and i and he and i was like better let go of my friend right now he's like what you gonna do ese <spanish> and i'm like what you gonna do and then like he threw me to the ground, then i and and no no he had his arm over me i put my arm over him and threw him to the ground and then it got broken up, but that was the last time, i got angry, it was cool it was fun, life, you know, huh i made <gibberish>, maybe that maybe that situation could've been handled differently, it could've been handled differently if they would've been handling things differently then i wouldn't have to react, it's not like i was mad i was acting off of reaction i had to react like that, because like justice like i couldn't it was unjust it was like, i'm not a mean person at all but when i saw, one of my loved ones get attacked i had to like come, and like you know like react to that, and they were the hot, you know what i mean i was like yo ya niggas is tripping like yo, chill out this is a tiny little white dude, you're a humongous ass mexican nigga it's like you need to fall back, you know what i mean it was crazy, <laughter>, guilty, uh i don't know i steal shit sometime from stores when i'm hungry, if i got no money, i guess i'm not really guilty 'cause i don't know actually yeah i don't feel guilty about that, food should be free, know what i mean, but um, yeah i don't know, i lie i guess i lie <l> everybody lies sometime i lie sometimes, maybe like little like idle here and there exaggerations, okay <ok>, nah nah never, the hardest, i guess, i don't really know what the hardest decision was but i get faced with hard decisions, and those would be like, i got so many friends sometimes, i can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend, so it's like i gotta make decisions like if i go over this sector of the town, i'm gonna hang out with x y z niggas if i go over here x y z niggas so it's like, heavy you know, those are hard decisions 'cause i never like to let anybody down, so uh yeah stuff like that deciding between friends to hang out with, ouch, it's cool i live with my mom, i come home like every three to four days, so i'm i, who, what could you repeat the question, um, my aunty, oh she's just really nice she's like a little sweet little blind old lady, who cooks really good, and it's tight i don't know, something i could erase from my memory, i wouldn't wanna erase anything from my memory, 'cause that'll be like, because like, the experiences you go through make you who you're who you are, i think weak people like to wanna erase things or block things out like, i don't that doesn't exist i mean there's shit that's been hard, but i would never say i would not want that to happen, 'cause you know you must you gotta learn from experience you know i mean to be the better you, all that shit is like a is like test you know, that bad experience is just a test you gotta overcome, and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my god life's hard oh, you know that shit's for weak people, i don't believe in that, i have compassion for people who do get a, who do wanna do stuff like that but i still like, i don't see the logic in it, mm, i mean i stay up pretty late and do all sorts of reckless ass shit so uh but when i am home, and it's pretty easy i could just go to sleep, you know when i get tired i get tired, yeah, lately i've been on this like i've been partying hella tough lately like oh my god for at least six days, like today coming to do this talk to you, was the first time i've been able to come back to culver city since like friday, 'cause i've been downtown and then it was like cinco de mayo, and it was like you know random ass parties i went to with homies, smoking ridiculous amounts of cigarettes drinking beers, fucking did some molly, fucking did some coke, fucking shit was crazy yo it was just like uh, it was a rockstar weekend, or a week, or, type of stuff, that's post traumatic stress syndrome, no i have not, i have not, but i get, oh i mean shoot saturday i was hella happy, <laughter>, it was great, but i was under the influence so, but it was still great you know i was mad empathic, like, mad like a flirty, mm i was freestyling like a g i was like kicking hella rhymes <sniffle>, uh it was dope you know, analyzing my life realized some stuff that i'm gonna change about my life and uh yeah it was i had a ball it was great, it was awesome i < >, oh yeah it was, no, i didn't even have a crazy comedown, i'm i'm like i'm chilling, i definitely gained a couple pounds from last week i've been drinking a lot of beers i'm feeling a little extraneous but besides that, i'm i'm, ready, hmm okay, i don't know as a lovable dude, people be loving me man they don't like me they love me, and that shit's crazy, i just you know i just try to be happy i try to make people happy and just you know <sniffle>, be real posi-core as they've said, like this is hella positive <p> positive you know, man i really don't wish i could i mean i'd lose weight i guess that's about it, but besides that i that's i mean i ride bikes every day like my legs are pretty strong, maybe i'd just get more buff in the arm, but that's about the only thing i would change and i don't really <r> i'm not really in a hurry to change that like if that happens just through me living and me biking more, then yeah cool but i don't not <n> i'm not you know abrupt change i don't need i mean gradual change sure, but i'm not i don't know yeah, i wouldn't change anything but if i would it would be that but really nothing 'cause i'm chilling right now, uh, i don't know i got broken up with like, in august that made me feel bad about myself i guess, and yeah it was just somebody i was going out with but they just broke up with me and like that shit sucked, but that was probably the last time like i felt really bad about myself <cough>, um what exactly do you wanna know about that, oh like um, i don't know we were just going out and then she was just hella jealous and was going through my phone sometimes and accusing me of shit but then she ended up breaking up with me, just 'cause she wanted to like mess around with other people, and that was the relationship in a nutshell, uh life sucks you gotta adapt and change man, know what i mean, don't walk from it run to what'd you say, yeah that bitch gave me s_t_ds that shit sucks fucking a, that's the only thing i regret, yeah man it's a cold game, but i i got the shot it was cool i'm like boom clean, but that's about it, i don't know she's a cool person we still hang out, you know, she keep losing i'm just gonna keep winning know what i mean, don't run from it run to it know what i mean, <laughter>, wait wait ten <t> ten or twenty years ago, i i was only seven years old you what do i tell my seven year old self, he wouldn't be able to comprehend the advice i would give what <w> what'd you say, oh oh oh yeah he wouldn't um be able to comprehend the advice i'd give him, i'd be like, just um fucking, read a little more books or something dude like, uh, i don't know man fucking it's gonna be okay you're you you you're great just keep, doing <ts> cool shit and have a ball, i don't know, i wouldn't know, i wouldn't wanna alter young me actually and this is why i say this, because, if i would to tell my young self to do something differently, i would not have grown into the person i am right now, to even be able to tell my young self something, if if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all that shit is real and time travel you know, anything i do in the past, would, this life would be now be a variable so me going back there, telling him to do something differently will alter the course of history and then the time stream that i'm in may not may cease to exist, you know what i'm saying so i really wouldn't wanna do that, i'll just be like do fuck up fuck up more even, but yeah make more mistakes 'cause the only way to, to be a better person is to make hella mistakes you know, at least that, at least that's like my my reckless like mindstate like yo if you're gonna fuck up fuck up hard, 'cause you'll learn more from it, you know they say what do they say, um experience is the best professor, you know what i'm saying that's basically what that that's how i jive you know what i mean, <sniffle>, i'm proud of this life that i'm here doing stuff like this <laughter>, like i'm like so stoked, i've been around the country i've been on people's albums, i write i do voiceover works from time to time, and yeah i people know me i rap i ride bikes, i've infiltrated multiple, subculturals i mean subcultures and types of people in the city, , and um yeah man i don't know, i guess it's like i live my life like i'm running for mayor but i'm not really running for mayor i'm just running to be the best me i can be, so i'm kissing hands and shaking babies along the way and it it's been a rad fantastic time, and it could only get bigger and better, <sniffle>, are you sure, woah, totally that's crazy, bye, i love you, <laughter> you love you too, that's tight should i press the button now or what, oh okay okay well can you wave, do you do that, do you wave, oh you don't wave okay for sure, bye",2
492,"<synch>, yes, doing pretty good thank you, maryland, yes, eighty five, yeah, yeah it is a long time, um not as often as i'd like, um out of work so you know the money issue, yeah, um, maryland, uh is different, it and so the comparison is, the only comparison is that um they're both cities, but uh, maryland has its flavor and l_a has its own flavor so they have unique you know characteristics about themselves, i moved to l_a uh because i was living in hawaii, and um i was out of money, and i just had enough for a plane ticket, uh and come and stay um, uh here in a hotel until i found a job which i did really quickly but anyway so that's why i came here i didn't wanna go home, um, i decided to come here and just start over, i am i am, yeah, um, it was, real easy just did it, i like i like l_a's weather, i like uh the different areas in uh los angeles county, uh west l_a east l_a um, uh i like southern california, you know period so, uh you know i like the people but um, yeah so i like the um, the, attitude you know the l_a attitude so yeah, um, i don't like, um, i don't like some of the uh policies with regard to, um uh the smoking you know i really wish that the, uh, government would crack down on smoking on the streets make it like u_s_c, yeah, no not outside of uh uh, getting on the bus and things like that, i was studying to be a nurse, yeah, i wanted to uh have a job that pays well, but uh afforded me um, the opportunity to use my um service gift, so yeah, no i had to put that uh, put that on the side and uh, i want to get a business degree now, yeah, <laughter>, my dream job is um, is to, create new technology, mm other than to say i would like to uh create something that, would change the world like steve jobs with his iphone, yeah, i am it depends on the situation but i'm more outgoing, i do, tend towards a little shyness from time to time, mhm, mm, mm, <laughter>, um what i do is i'll go to the movies, um i went to the movies probably like uh maybe five weeks ago, yeah, um, well i had a argument recently not really a argument but a disagreement, with a woman at my church who um, is over, this particular department that i'm in, and it's a volunteer position uh, i use my uh administrative assistant um more executive assistant skills, to uh, to uh, i do minutes for meetings that i cover, and um and so then i have to um produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that, and uh this person um, is micromanaging me uh but not micromanaging the other, uh admin assistant who, did not get her block of people into this particular meeting, so the meeting should've been comprised of a hundred people, but we had like maybe thirty no wasn't even thirty twenty, yes <laughter> so um, now she doesn't know that i realize you know that part of it, so um, there was a little bit of a argument and uh but again not a argument but a disagreement, and when we talk again i will, point out to um the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect, and um the the energy she <sh> she's investing, uh in me is uh unprofitable, for what we're trying to achieve, don't that doesn't that sound good <laughter>, yeah, well a little attacked, you know, so, it depends on i'm very good at controlling my temper, it's uh you know there are places where you can, allow your temper to come out, even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot, so uh i'm pretty good at controlling my temper, yeah, um, i don't have any situation, recent that i can think of um, probably say, um, just dealing with a neighbor uh instead of uh, uh responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor altogether so i wish i had done that differently, yeah, hmm, thankfully, i've not had to make that type of decision, in my life as yet, mhm, hmm, um, mm, i have um, what i do in my life and and you know in my, going forward you know um, everything that, i've done and everything that has happened, i, accept it as something that, has to be, to get me to go forward, uh i am a born again christian and so i know that, that god is sovereign over my life, uh and also that according to his word, the bible says that every day of our life is written in his book, so events and circumstances, um, i feel that i feel they are ordained by god now obviously i'm not going to, um jump into a, burning fire or do anything ridiculous, but um, i feel that things that had happened <hap> that have happened even if i've dealt with them the wrong way, uh it's god's, sovereignty <s> his, total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good, so that's how i feel, um, i have all brothers, and so i'm not really that close with my brothers, and my mother, say that again, um people that i've grown up with um, neighbors from when i've, uh when i was younger, uh that i was close to, um uh, different friends, uh that i've had along the way uh friends who, are more like family, so yeah, they've had positive influence, that's i get i sleep too well <laughter>, so i sleep well every night, so, normal, but i my normal i've been feeling my normal, no, no, no, um, that was recent, something happened um, i was um able to participate, um, with um my church on sunday with <wi> i was a pentecost, it was pentecost sunday meaning it was fifty days after the resurrection of jesus christ, and so i was able to participate uh in our prayer, session that we had at my church and uh that was really, made me very happy, so, mhm, that uh i'm smart they would say that i'm smart, that uh, that i handle difficulties very well, um, and that i dress well <laughter>, <laughter>, um, i don't wanna change anything, i do want to just be a better me so be a better person, uh so um, i am working on uh listening better, uh communicating better, uh and and uh accepting my, uh, weaknesses better as well as my strengths, no, mm that's a good question, i would have uh, i would've told myself to, to uh do what i know to do to do what i know, uh that which is right and um ooh , uh to do, what i know is right, and uh let everything else let, the other chips fall where they may, but to do what i know to do is right, and to go forward, um, i am very proud of the fact that, uh i don't give up, bye and thank you, see ya'll <laughter>",0
423,"yes, i'm doing well, los angeles the greater los angeles area, people, diversity, and, various entertainment and activities, um fickle weather, traffic, and litter, i have traveled domestically not internationally, seeing other places and how people live and the culture, the last trip that i went to was san diego, but uh, from childhood or as an adult, um family vacations to um baja and rosarito beach, yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because um, this weekend is easter and we usually will go, down to easter <east> easter spring break, to rosarito baja, um i have a bachelor's <b> bachelor's in communication studies, because it's a open field, just doesn't deal with um, communication interactively but performing arts, telecommunications, business entrepreneurship so, no i'm not i'm actually unemployed, um, i think to own my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company, um, i would like to open something in like the telecommunications area, as a business, something do online online services, um i like to make things with my hands, so my next venture would, would be to create all natural soy candles, something in that area, um a mixture, a mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people and crowds, and that's how i usually make a determination if i, remain reserved or remain open, i listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk, or go get a massage, fair, oh man <laughter> uh probably yesterday or this morning, um, usually the argument is about, me making myself clear, or me repeating myself twice, no it usually gets the other person in trouble, mm, i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission, and i had a warranty, and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs, and the guy offered me a portion of, the settlement agreement, and i decided to take him to small claims court, to get a bigger amount, and i wish i would've have, taken the offer that he gave me, at the midst of, dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs, and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing, the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion, so i wish i would've, taken the higher, road than taken the lower road, i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things, hardest decision, uh i don't know financially emotionally, mm, emotionally letting go a past relationship, it's the hardest thing that i, i won't say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing, yes it was a relationship of seven years, but um that person has already moved on, so, uh they want me to be in their life, in hopes that, if something goes wrong with my current relationship, we'll always have something to fall back on, uh yeah it is hard, um an event, something i could erase from my memory, um, i don't know <laughter> there's a lot of events, that i just automatically erase from my memory but whatever comes to mind right, um, probably the death of a relative, um alone and misinformed, because i didn't know that they were that sick, and i didn't know that they were um their days were numbered, and i could've had more opportunity to, spend time with them and make, better a better connection in the last days, um, it's fair to midland, mm, my immediate i'm very close but distant not very close, my mother, um yes uh she's encouraged me to, continue my education, to always fall back on my, hobbies hopes goals and dreams, she always encourages me to, always stay aloof and, out there looking for a better opportunity, and she encourages me to, not be afraid to, explore other ventures, easy <laughter> easy <laughter>, i've been feeling well, um, yes a little stressed but i'm trying to manage that, i leave the stressful environment, um, in the past, about three years ago, um, because i was having issues in my learning environment, and um i feeling <f> i was feeling, emotionally attacked, yeah i was having uh a issue with a professor who, was just very, i don't know a a very different personality, and, he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school, i felt, i felt um like i was in a a dishonest environment, i felt, like i wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class, but i had no choice but to stay in there, and deal with his meanness for the whole semester, um i think through finding p_t_s_d they were trying to link depression, no, financially, i'm not capable and i haven't found a counselor who is willing and committed, to working with me and helping me with my issues, i find that a lot of counselors they listen to me, and then they laugh at me and then they tell me, the opposite of what's, what i'm telling them, mhm, mm, last time i felt really happy, i really don't know, that's a good question, um, just just did what i want i just relaxed, i just relaxed and, i you know i don't know <laughter>, i don't have any best friends, my best qualities that i'm uh hard working i'm reliable, i'm a excellent friend, um, i'm energetic, and i'm a go getter, things that i wish i could change about myself, probably be less sensitive, don't take things so personally, and um, learn how to help myself before helping others, no i don't have any regrets in my life, um if i could've do things differently ten years ago, i probably would've, focused and studied more, and less, being out of the house and, hanging with friends, mm that i got have a a college education, and i'm self sufficient, and, i can pay my bills by myself <laughter>, and, i'm alive, goodbye",0
408,"yes i am, i'm doing great, i am originally from venezuela, i was two years old, yes i was, um been only once, i do not have family there anymore uh my uh siblings live in florida nowadays, wow there's so many things i like about l_a i like the weather i like people, overall i think the weather we're very lucky here, traffic, uh i have traveled some, meeting new people and doing new learning about new cultures, i enjoy languages, uh traveling itself, i have traveled to italy uh i lived there for seven and a half years and i studied abroad, i've uh visit a few countries through europe and i had a real good time, um probably traveling uh through rail along europe and getting to know cities in that way, totally outgoing, i do meditation, um, it's usually a practice that you can becomes very natural so my body's able to, um, sense when i'm not feeling at ease and i naturally um, breathe and start my meditation process, mm it could be hard if you don't practice it every day or if you're not able to quiet your mind, however if you um meditate for a long time it becomes a practice like going to the gym or, drinking your daily water um you can naturally learn to meditate, i think pretty good, i typically do not argue uh, and i don't remember any instance of arguing with someone recently, maybe being on the freeway and taking the wrong exit <laughter>, i would've probably paid attention to uh my uh probably g_p_s or not being over confident, hardest decision i ever had to make uh, i guess moving back from europe to l_a coming back home <laughter> i miss my friends, it was time to come back i had done my schooling and it was time to come back home see my parents and join my family, i love my family they're the core of my life, i have a nephew he's uh six years old and he's the love of my life, love them all, my teachers uh my parents and definitely my mentors, well i don't think i have anything that bad that i want to erase from my memory um, i can't think of any sorry <laughter>, guilty about, i don't think i have anything to feel guilty about, however sometimes i feel guilty when i eat a lot of cookies 'cause that is not good for my health <laughter>, very easy i sleep like a baby once i hit the bed <laughter>, i've been feeling good, no, i felt really happy about two months ago, i went to a, friend's birthday she celebrated in a casino by a city away from los angeles, san bernadino and i was playing with a twenty five cents with quarters and i won like seventy five dollars in the machine so that was very cool <laughter>, uh, outgoing always planning something exciting to do, um very outspoken, mm not that i know of no, oh, always do what you want to do life is short and um always, keep on learning, uh i want to lose two more pounds, i i've been very very blessed i've never really felt anyone make me feel bad, and i usually interact well with everyone i meet and i'm very blessed to have everyone be nice to me, i'm a great listener uh, i spend quality time with my friends and family, uh not quantity necessarily but quality time, and i'm very supportive and i love to pretty much listen listen and listen sometimes that's all people need, i went to school um i have two degrees, um business management um uh degree and also i have a language degree, i learned languages when i was very little uh had the opportunity to travel, and it was easier for me to keep on learning languages, and uh the business part i enjoy interacting with people creating um new ideas, uh innovating, so i believe that's where my interested in uh business came from mhm, yes i am, <laughter> my dream job one that wouldn't have probably challenges every day, uh one that i could uh, i don't know i'd just come to the office and everybody and everything would be perfect but, uh it's not real so uh i think one of the main things about having a a job is enjoying those challenges, very proud of myself, uh my accomplishments, and i'm also very proud of my family, and my friends, and how they have uh, uh achieved and overcome their obstacles, um sure i have a friend of mine who is now in new york state university, she had quite some challenges trying to get there and funding her education and now she is um, uh not only in the school but she hosts has acquired uh some funding for her education through a lot of writing letters and petitions and things she did, in order to conquer her dream to be in school so very proud of her, thank you, goodbye",0
377,"yeah, come on., i'm fine., i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a little and then i lived abroad for a little while then i moved to california, mhm, i moved here at the end of june last year, so i guess it was eight months ago that there was such a thing., to <sigh>, most likely twice a year, to <sigh> it's a good question, i've always wanted to live in california, but i had lived in the central coast around, and, i had just come to l a as once a month for various business and network and personal development things so, yeah, things changed., in santa cruz for me the customer i had who was really the most important as financial, um, main source of finance i had that relationship ended, so i was totally free to move and i thought, well i think i'll give l a a try and see what happens so, so i gave it a chance and here i am, oh not at all <laughter> it's a very big city around, i lived in dublin in ireland it was one that is also a big city, but, as you know, european cities are much more dense and public transport is much easier to use., and, yeah, so just getting around here and getting acquainted with the city was pretty challenging and uh, yeah, that's good., so, i love to travel i love it yes i have lived in ireland and i traveled around, i was in morocco and i was in costa rica, i spent some time in mexico, so.., yeah, that's good., to meet i love <sigh> new people who experience new cultures and how, not only see what is different, but see what is similar among people everywhere you go, to be sure, good., i guess.., i'm trying to think what my favorite was i mean anyway there were amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but, morocco was incredible, it was like twelve days and we went to three different places that we found in the atlas mountains that are beautiful and uh, yeah, it's a really cool culture, so it was fun., um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there, which is why i decided to move there, so, my most memorable moment of this trip, i mean, there are probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of this trip was, to be on a bus and go, to dublin and go only to the country and, see how absolutely stunningly beautiful it is i mean, it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in movies and it's green and lush and beautiful, but, when you actually get there and experience it, it's like the pictures don't do it right, so it was incredible, yeah, that's good., um i have a degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women's studies, no i use my english and psychology to work in marketing communication so, i'm actually doing sales, so yes, psychology definitely comes into play., comes into play and anyway does my, i guess my undergrade in english, but really how i accepted that and created something out of it because most people who only teach an english degree and i didn't want to teach, um, to, i'm not quite sure about the question., all right., wow around <sigh>, you know my dream job is, as a, a motivational speaker and trainer and trainer, to travel the world, to do so and to influence people's lives, and, to make a real contribution to people, around my relationship is pretty good actually i, i just fixed my relationship with my biological mother who, she wasn't sporadic i saw her grow up sporadic i lived my father pulled me and then he married my stepmother and, they had two children together, so i grew up and i consider them the family i grew up with, but i talked to my biological mother., um, last may and we were, we know that things have been cleared up and have been in communication ever since., um, well, i don't know what moment you mean, but if you mean to be in communication with my biological mother, um, i mean, it was very liberating to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and anyway not only the future, but in the present moment with it so, yeah, that's good., i'm shy., to relax, i do a number of things that i like to do yoga, although i don't have the money for it right now. i love to dance., i love to read, i love to go into the ocean spending time just staring at the waves and soaking all these negative ions, which really recharges my battery, probably more than anything else, um, i like being with friends around, i love art and, try new restaurants around, yeah, all these things are, both relaxing anyway i think they relax in the sense that, i feel connected with the people in my life and with the experiences of my life so, yeah, that's right., depends on whether i'm not driving very well, but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>, to <sigh> last time i argued with someone, it should probably be, oh no, it was with the l a times about newspaper delivery, yeah, that was the last time., yes, the <sigh>um the newspaper that should appear for the elderly lady i care for, it didn't show up., and, i didn't know it was just there., um, late, i don't know, afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called her and, they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning, which was absurd to me when they made the mistake at all., so i mean for a service we pay for every day, so, um, it was really irritable and then i found out that, the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and had not been communicated with me, so, i was angry at the times when i was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and had not told me that i was quite frustrated., oh wow there are quite a lot of them around, let me think about one, um, i had a call the other day., and i'm in a coaching program and, it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program, and she explained to me that there was an additional call that we would meet every week, and then we also have coaching calls because we have a specific trainer we work with., and then she called to tell me that i had another coaching call with, um, someone who's not my coach and uh that, had not been explained to me as part of the program so that at that moment it seemed to me just like oh my god i have all this, people i have to be accountable to and i'm like anyway you know i have to, not only be accountable to them, but share private things that happen in my life with these people and it was just i don't know, so, yeah, i wasn't.., i wasn't angry i was just feeling frustrated and a little overwhelmed at this moment and, you know, and i talked her out of it, and we've been through it, but.., um, yeah, i could have done it., sure was just okay with what was asked by me at that time and, i would have made the call much smoother., the hardest decision there was was a few., i guess moving to ireland was probably the toughest decision, no, it wasn't even the hardest decision, it was such a simple decision, but telling my family about it was, challenging, but the hardest decision was my first time that i, moved, uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided i decided to move to colorado, and that was a pretty tough decision, because then my family was, you know, within an hour drive from wherever i lived for an hour and a half and now you'll know,, around a twelve hour drive or an airplane ride away, so it was difficult, oh, many things.., i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful and beautiful condition, the weather is so much better than wisconsin and around, at the time i was very much in rock climbing, and there is only a huge outdoor community in colorado, so there were a lot more people who, to be in my age group and or single that was another factor around, and were interested in the things i was interested in, so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit, so, yes and then i found a job i liked the pay was cruel, but, i found some work that was really rewarding and so everything came together and i decided to move, yeah, that's good., that was a completely independent question about <sigh>, relatively light, it just depends on how long i go to sleep when i'm outside and i don't come home until eleven thirty, you know, then i go to bed too late and uh i wake up on feeling tired as i feel today, but usually i can sleep through the night i had some pretty, fear paralyzed dreams over the last few weeks, but even if i wake up from them or if i know i can move from them, i can still fall back relatively easily to sleep, yeah, i'm sure they're i mean, i'm in another transition state from which i'm moving out, from the house where i live, where i take care of an elderly woman., yeah, and i just need to find, the financial means to support me and it is, and she creates a lot of fear just in her state of being she is exhausting and totally depressing, so, yeah, that's good., to live with her is pretty hard, as if it was probably the most difficult thing i've ever done, and i would never do it again if i were honest, if i knew what i was getting into, i don't think i would have said yes to the situation., i feel trapped and helpless, like you don't know anything i can do., there's no way out of the situation that i don't care what i do, it doesn't get better i don't know that i don't get any kind of work i want to do, and my money doesn't work at all., so yeah, it feels pretty crappy, <laughter>thank you, i've been in the past, yes, oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago, i was suicidal., oh, yeah, i feel like i'm down there, i don't really know no, um, i stopped originally., with my therapist because we had finished, i mean, we had, worked on what had to be worked and i was no longer depressed, and then i started the therapy again, later, i think i was in my early thirties., and then we ended this because i moved to ireland, so.., yes, i mean, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention as i don't think in therapy oh i'll be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous, i think you're going to therapy to work on a particular problem and have a solution and someone who's your soundboard can see things you can't see., and, you know, work through this situation and come with.., a strategy for, not only that not only the creation of a solution in this area, but also the creation of strategies, and uh tools for the rest of your life so you don't have to be in therapy forever, deep breath the last time i felt really happy, what are you doing?, wow, that's pretty sad, it's been at least a year., no, that's not true., if i, saw my biological mother who was last may, my best qualities, to <sigh>, i'm very strong, very strong willed, i um, i am very supportive and loving and caring, um, i'm just being here, i'm intelligent., and, um, yeah, that's good., everything i regret, i don't think so., no, don't take life too seriously, oh, my ideal weekend, i spend some time on the beach, i spend some time with friends, either go out in the evening in a movie, or, i'm just going out to.., a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together, to maybe go dancing later, and on sundays i usually go to, , and then i got brunch with friends and, um, yeah, i'm going home and sunday night i'm getting ready for the next day so, hmm <sigh>, i'm very proud of, um, a few things i mean, i moved to places i wanted to move to., and so i have done things that have really spoken to me and have, meaning something you know that i loved the heart to actually do it., um, mm reach those who , objectives or objectives, yes, i did things i wanted to do, like move to ireland and move to california., mhm, all right., safe, see you.",16
451,"<sync>, yes, okay other than this laryngitis i have, uh cleveland ohio, in uh, seventy nine i think it was <laughter>, mhm, um, once a year, something like that or less, um uh there's a lot more to do here, um, they're a little more narrow minded, back there and republican <laughter>, um well originally show business, but probably to get away from uh, cleveland, it was very difficult at first, um i'm not used to uh change i don't like change very much you know, having to, uh meet new people and, figure out how to make a living, well, i like, the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness, the movies um, the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather, um the driving the congestion, some of the, superficial attitude, the importance mhm, um well not a lot but i do, i just came back from vegas to, visit relatives we met there, and i'm going to mexico, um next month, um, well seeing the different, cultures like been to europe, greece france <p> um italy, um, i like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona, i never saw sedona that was really uh, an experience, pure peaceful, about sedona, yeah, well sedona's a very, energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat, kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful, uh pine trees, and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and, and after a day the pain in my back went away, that i had there for months, so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy, so it was really um, very mystical, in life <laughter>, or in sedona in life, um, well being on stage in boston, and um that was great i i loved doing that, um, um just being with friends and laughing, are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically, well um, i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events, and um, i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and, just laugh and, and, i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but, just being with somebody who's in tune with, my sense of humor and uh gets, my jokes and, you know i get his and we're, just um enjoying that moment, um speech and drama, i i majored in, uh no not now, i always was interested in um, musical comedy when i was a child i would, sing along to records in my living room, and i was always in choirs, in school and then when i, uh went to high school i joined the drama club, and i i just always had an interest and i always had a, a big personality and, well <laughter>, um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore, i'm sixty and, i don't know if i, have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything, right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just, um, relax and travel but um, i i like being creative, in in any way i can i like independence, and i kind of have that right now so, i'm okay, um, well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded, and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for, um gosh since nineteen eighty eight, and um i'm, a district leader in my community, and we have meetings and that really helps to, center me and bring out my higher self, so if i get tense or nervous i i chant, um sometimes okay sometimes not, a lot yes yes <laughter>, less and less though it's been happening less and less, but um, yeah sometimes it's got it's, it's um, created difficulties, well, i can't <c> <sigh>, i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like, was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving, and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway, about four miles out of our way and i just, i got very angry for about, thirty seconds and then i had to, calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it, so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but, i felt kind of, bad that i overreacted, um, you mean in my life <laughter>, manys, yes, um, gosh there's so many <laughter>, i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing, information, like, they're not gonna use me on a job or something, that i would, take an attitude that, um, i'll find something better it's okay and, move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me, and, you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and, you know that, whole uh, thought process that really doesn't help the situation, and i do that more often, but i, since i started chanting, but it doesn't you know, i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where, i can do that, um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what, television to buy or something <laughter> but um, um, i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences, and um, um, or leaving my comfort, zone <z> place, if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place, that would be a very difficult decision for me, and probably leaving a relationship, very hard because, you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship, so i usually, live it out til, it's for you know it's, they leave or something you know it's very hard for me, to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on, so what i usually do is i don't make the decision, and i end up suffering, but longer, so, mhm, can we move on, um, well, uh it's hard, because um i don't know if it's because i have pain, in my back, and neck, but, i i it's difficult for me to, stay asleep i'd i i, i don't get a um, a deep sleep, um, but, at because of, uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil, and that's been putting me to sleep so, i have been um, sleeping better because of it, but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell, but before that all happened, i was um, finding it difficult to stay asleep, and so therefore i'm tired during the day and, uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable, but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or, emotional things or or or or not, i'm sorry could you repeat that, have i studied changes in my behavior, uh no <laughter>, i was not, no, mm mm, oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know, well i uh, was going to um, vegas to, meet my family was my, my family was flying in from cleveland to, uh there we have a, a relative in uh vegas, and i drove with my friend, and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday, so, we all went and, had a good time in vegas, i mean i was struggling through my cold but, but it was fun it was nice, well <laughter>, uh they think i'm funny um, they feel that i say it like it is, um, they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so, people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me, 'cause i'll, i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic, but just <ju> that's just the way i talk, so, um my um, the, anger that sometimes wells up in me, you know i just, but although that that really made me i think, a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your, experiences make you who you are, and how you handle them, makes you who you are and if you don't have those, lows you don't really know what highs are, so i don't, i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever, but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today, and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these, moments where i've, just blurt out you know anger or something, i just wish that would happen more less, that the anger parts would happen less, and they are so, i guess it will <laughter>, happen less, um, don't give up hope live in the moment, and um, everything will everything will work out everything will work out, and if you believe that, then you really have nothing to fear, um, the fact that now, and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been, cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become, more um, compassionate person, and i'm able to um, uh, <ss> understand people better, and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too, and, that, if you if you treat people, from that respect that they're, they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because, you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally, and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate, you're you're happy and your life is happy, okay",4

unique characteristics about themselves, i moved to i a uh because i lived in hawaii, and i didn't have any money., and i had just enough for a plane ticket, uh and come and stay around, uh here in a hotel until i found a job that i did really fast, but anyway, that's why i came here, i didn't want to go home., um, i decided to come here and start over., i am i am, yeah, that's good., um, it was, quite simply it has just done, i like the weather of l a., i like uh the different areas in uh los angeles county, uh west l a east l a uh west l a uh west l a east l a uh west l a uh west l a uh west l a uh west l a uh west l a uh west l a uh west l a east l a uh west l a uh west l a uh west l a, i like southern california, you know period so, you know i like people, but.., yeah, so i like the.., the, attitude you know the l a attitude so yeah, um, i don't like it., um, i don't like some of the uh directives regarding, um uh smoking you know that i really wish that the, uh, government would break smoking on the street making it like u s c, yeah, that's good., no not outside of uh uh, get on the bus and stuff like that, i've learned to be a nurse., yeah, that's good., i wanted a job that would pay off well., but i let myself., the possibility to use my service gift, so yes., no, i had to bet that., put this on the side and uh, i want to get a business degree now., yeah, that's good., < slaughter>, my dream job is.., is, creating new technology, i don't want to say that i want to create something that, would change the world like steve jobs with his iphone, yeah, that's good., i'm it depends on the situation, but i'm more starting, i know., tend to some shyness from time to time, mhm, mm, mm, < slaughter>, what i do is i go to the movies, i probably went to the movies five weeks ago., yeah, that's good., um, well, i had an argument recently not really an argument, but a disagreement, with a woman in my church who, it's over, this special department in which i am, and it's a voluntary position uh, i use my uh administration assistant to get more executive assistant skills, to uh, to uh, i make minutes for meetings i cover, and around and then i have to produce the minutes and send them to all and such things., and this person.., is micromanaging me uh, but not micromanaging the other, uh admin assistant who, did not get their block of people in this special meeting, so the meeting should have been made up of a hundred people., but we had maybe thirty no was not even thirty twenty, yes <laughter> around, now she doesn't know that i realize that you know this part of it., so, um.., there was a little argument and uh again no argument, but a difference of opinion, and when we talk again i will, points out the person who is above both of us that there is a separation, and the energy it invests, in me is unprofitable, for what we are trying to achieve, doesn't sound good <laughter>, yeah, that's good., well, a little attacked, you know, so, it depends on me being very good in controlling my temperament, it's uh you know there are places where you can, allow your temper to come out, even if it may not be appropriate and then there are other places where when it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot, so uh i'm pretty good at controlling my temperament, yeah, that's good., um, i don't have a situation., the other day, i can think of, likely to say, um, i'm just dealing with a neighbor., i answer the neighbor and ignore the neighbor, so i wish i'd done something different., yeah, that's good., hmm, thankfully, i didn't have to make that kind of decision., in my life still, mhm, hmm, um, mm, i've.., what i do in my life and you know in my, you know how to keep going., everything that, i've done everything that's happened., i, to accept it as something that, must be , to get me to move forward, uh i'm a reborn christian and so i know that, that god is sovereign over my life, uh and also according to his word, the bible says that every day of our lives is written in his book, so events and circumstances, um, i feel that i feel that she is ordained by god now obviously i am not too, in order to enter a, burn fire or do something ridiculous, but.., i feel that things that had happened had happened, even if i treated them in the wrong way., it's god's., be sovereignty < s>, total sovereignty has control over it, and it will work for my good, so that's how i feel, um, i have all the brothers, and so i'm not really that close to my brothers, and my mother, say that again., people i grew up with., neighbors off when i have, when i was younger, i was about to., um, um.., different friends, uh, that i had on the way uh friends who, are more like family, so yes., they had a positive influence., that's that i sleep too well <laughter>, so i sleep well every night, so, normal, but i mean normal i have my normal feeling, no, um, that was recently, something happened., i was able to participate, um, with around my church on sunday with <wi> i was a pentecost, it was pentecost sunday meaning it was fifty days after the resurrection of jesus christ, and so i could take part in our prayer uh, session we had in my church and uh that was really, made me very happy, so, mhm, that i'm smart, they'd say that i'm smart, that.., that i handle problems very well, um, and that i dress well <laughter>, < slaughter>, um, i don't want to change anything., i just want to be a better me, so be a better person, um, um.., i'm working on listening to you better., better communication, uh and and uh accept my, uh, weaknesses better than my strengths, no, mm that's a good question, i would have.., i would have told myself., to do what i know to do to do what i know, what's right and around ooh , uh to do, what i know is right, and leave everything else, the other chips fall where they can, but doing what i know to do is right, and to go forward, um, i am very proud of the fact that, i don't give

343,"yes, i'm fine., uh los close california, yes, i like the weather, um, i basically like people, different uh things to do out here, mm, i'm not sure., excuse me., , i'd have to say , someone's rude or uh, a person harasses or, only someone with a negative attitude, when i'm angry, it all depends on it, hmm, i could make a comment or something or.., i could just absorb it or something., you know you're just thinking about it., it all depends on the situation, no, i don't know., i think i had a disagreement, i don't know when the last time i was in any discussion i really wasn't it's a long time, it was basically just a difference of opinion, but i didn't argue with anyone <an> someone in quite some time i can't even remember, it was a family matter., and my brother had a disagreement with, with one of our other brothers and you know that he was upset about it in return i got a little upset because, you know, what do you mean?, laughter what you mean, how hard that is, what, so excuse me for <laughter> excuse me for laughing, now oh so you could go over it again, what was the question?, all right., listening to music, something, i don't know why i think you know, so it's a little i do, why did you ask me <a> why did you ask me that, what are you doing?, basic uh, things english mathematics, but why did you ask me this question?, i'm trying to find work., right, just a job i enjoy going, i don't really have a dream job., no, when my children were little, they played with them., this is the last time i really was, i remember, it's not easy., hmm, try to get some guidance or advice they hear, being a parent, you know you're connected to someone you know, it's a family., someone you love and, someone who loves you, is not much to say, <sigh>, i mean, i have kids, just you know., good not children i have a child, and two uh, sons who are older are adults., i think i'm close to them., what do i do?, what do you mean, what do i think of today's children, what do you mean?, i think they're more.., i don't think they're as respectful as, they were when i was one when i was young, when i was a child, i think they had less respect, no, no, before i uh, uh maybe <may> about six months ago or so, just how i felt, you know, i just didn't feel good i felt sad you know and, did not sleep well and, you know you didn't feel right., i had a problem with the way i felt, that was the whole purpose of me to seek some kind of help, feel good, have i ever done what, no, right now., no, oh, i don't sleep so well, i don't know why, if i had an answer, i'd sleep better., i don't know., no, i've never, i've never been to therapy., i don't have a best friend., i've got a, a few, i think i have some good qualities, i think i'm basically a good person, uh the company of uh, my employees, which usually do, hanging out with a friend only, we were just laughing and laughing and drinking beer., yeah, that's good., i felt good, no, i should have graduated from college., i said i should have done it., i've got a lot of them., hmm, well, i've got a lot of them, to get up this morning, that was unforgettable, because it was a new day, and gratefully, to be, <b> to live today, mhm, man, i'd say , to be a father, i'm just a father you know., and uh, this is an unforgettable experience, excuse me <scuse> me, i can't get around <sigh> i had a few of them i guess, uh some people i associated with, that's probably most of what i can imagine., thank you., all right., see you.",9
386,"yes, oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so <laughter>, i was born in canada, and but i've lived in california most of my life so, and it's grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish, the <laughter>, oh my gosh years and years ago, uh not at all i don't think i've gone back there <laughter> for a long time, well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so, travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost prohibitive so, uh huh, oh let's see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather <laughter> not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that, it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and, but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with, so, mhm, why did i move to l_a because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and, this became our home base and uh, that's why, easy very easy so, uh huh, uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it's they have designated courses and then after that, went to college and i was a business major let's see i was a veterinary major <laughter>, and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so, um, i don't know, can't really pinpoint why <laughter>, so, i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate, i'm a leasing consultant part time, i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives, oh, probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at, t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter>, but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so, but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals, so, i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet, you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social, oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um, take a walk uh call my friends, million things <laughter> so, i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody, cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so, mhm, mm, i can't really remember, so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i, avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so, i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of, mm, i can't think of anything right now, i, really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard, i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision, so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s> to san francisco for a job once but, since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and, that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider, mm, yeah, an event, hmm, well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever, so i know when my father died you know i mean, i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more, but, you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with, that, so, mhm, yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh, philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives, so, well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do, um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot, i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them, so, mhm we have a small family, uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many, types of kids out there i think, majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control, but um, i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very, well-behaved so can't say much else about that, well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um, uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but, they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes, run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't, yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting, ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll, kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so, i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>, but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of, you know, taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's, i can't say anything to her about that, so, yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know, at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but, for now you know that's i'll deal with it so, tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but, the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so, you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep, mhm, uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm, i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean, so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that, i um, i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know, whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of, creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies, and, you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so, no mm mm, no, i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person, and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so, hmm, can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so, no i never regret anything, uh huh, what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it, everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um, you know seems like <laughter>, uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um, wasted time with certain people um, i don't know those are the things that come to mind, maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things, but, mm, outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh, i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so, mhm, well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but, i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and, um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we, you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so, that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah, mhm, i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter>, but uh if you want i'll repeat it so, um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable, uh, i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener, and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm, don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so, hmm, that's a hard question <laughter> the, can't think i mean i'm, can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter>, for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um, i love going out with my friends, shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips, um, that's kind of, you know, part of it yeah that i mentioned so, traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it, um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries, uh the architecture, it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place, mhm, okay well <laughter> i've um been, to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can, whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um, each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are, there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um, kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international, and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's, but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so, uh, yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college, that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and, um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um, so yeah that's, mhm, yeah, mhm, thank you, goodbye",11

miami beach water was wonderful, yeah, that's it., development of children, mhm, well, um.., i've always been interested in children since i was younger., um i babysat a lot, so i had a lot of experience with children at a young age, and when i got older, i realized it was something i liked to do, that's why i'm here., that's when i looked around in children's development classes., and i thought it was something like i'd enjoy it, i started taking classes, and the rest is history., i am, it's.., 15 years in august, yeah, that's good., my dream job, i'd say.., becoming a principal, well, it's something i've been thinking about for a while, and.., i just started the steps to get this going., so i'll be back in school and i'll take classes, so i can do this., because it's a dream of mine yeah thank you, it will be quite difficult. there are several years of schooling that i have ahead of me., and you know it's definitely going to be a challenge, but it's something i'm ready for because it's a dream job of mine., so it's something i'm ready to do,, i'm ready to do, um, a little of both i think a little of both i can sometimes be shy about, and and also starting from, but i think a little of both i'd say, < slaughter>, i'm meditating., i'm a big big meditator, so i love meditating, i just love to read and just have nice quiet peaceful time, oh wow i'm very good at it, very good in controlling my temperament i around, let's do it again., a series of, meditation i do, it involves deep breathing and around, just really center yourself, until you can feel your heart beat and you can, to really feel everything in your body, and it really really allows you to relieve stress and control fear and anger, and things of this nature that helps me very much, oh wow, it was just about actually unfortunately, it was last week and it was with my husband, and, it was about, how he sometimes reacts to me, uh it can be a little aggressive, we're just trying to work with it because i don't respond well to aggression., i'm totally singing out, and that's actually what happened, so.., yeah, that's it., i felt, very frustrated, um, and i actually felt upset about, but frustrated and i also felt sad because i don't like fighting like this, it was a little bit of all these emotions at once, uh.., a situation i wish i had treated differently, to be honest, i haven't had a situation like this yet., in the years i have quite a lot of kind of, um, you know, somehow mastered, my answers, to a certain extent, irritation, i kind of managed to do this., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, it was good when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenager, for mother, i was pregnant when i was 16 and, um, i had.., a lot of pressure from the family to.., give up my child for adoption or, to cancel, and i chose life so that was, that was one of the toughest decisions, if not the toughest decisions you should make when you're a 16 year old., teenager to teenager, whether i wanted to continue to be a child and a teenager, or if i wanted to raise a life when i was a child myself., that i think was the hardest decision, i had to do it, um, well, i mean around my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later, and i'm really so glad it was one of the best things i've ever done., do not choose to cancel it and choose <choo> pro life, pro choice pro life and, i didn't regret the decision. it's my only child., i love him he's just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special about being his mother, i know., no, it's not easy, it's definitely in trouble., um, just like everything else., um, but at the end of the day it's really rewarding, um, and you'll just see the life that you've brought into the world and that you've raised, become a productive citizen and go into society and, easy to make their way and it's really rewarding it's really, oh wow, so many ways around, the first way <wa> uh the first way i really listen to my son and i, accepts his feedback even if i don't like it, and i allow him to express his self, luckily, unfortunately, when i was little to, there wasn't much conversation between parents and children, it was more like we were just told that you know what to do and we did it., um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self, i allow him to give me feedback to give me negative or positive, because i feel that it is really important for a child to develop her voice at a young age., and around as parents you have to be supportive and that and somehow around, make sure you feed this, because this is, type of, the way they develop, you know, and it's really important, so, i am different in order in many ways in this rite, thank you., to <sigh>, all right., it sometimes depends on it, it depends on the time i go to sleep, it depends on the time i woke up., so it's a lot of factors around i can't just give you an answer around i'd say that, it varies sometimes i can go to sleep and fall asleep immediately, and other times i can go to sleep and it could take a while to actually fall asleep, so, it varies, i've been feeling great lately, i was really.., i can't say that, like i said last week, it didn't affect me, um, you know the fight with my husband, but.., different than that i felt really good, no, i didn't., no i didn't, you know what honest i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up, i'm happy because, this is a chance for me,, use carpe diem grab the day, i feel blessed every morning, i wake up, it's a blessing you know, because, i know some people didn't wake up., some people are homeless, go through so many situations that are really daunting, and i'm not like that, i really feel blessed, every day, thank you., in order to , care of patients lovingly, friendly, um, type of reserved, um, well, i wish i'd already graduated from college and had my master's degree, and sometimes i wish i was a little more knowledgeable, in certain subjects, and i can change if i can change everything, i would change that these two things, and also i would be a little more starting and less from an introvert, you know what's no regret, no regret., you live and learn for nothing is perfect, everything i've been through has made me the person i am today., so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person i'm today, oh <sigh> man stay in school to stay in school and, get your training and put that first and foremost before a relationship, even before your career, i really would have told myself., to stay focused and, get a great education, i'm very proud of.., where i came from, as a teenage mother, to be a statistic and actually change that, on my same i've been doing my uh same job for fifteen years now i'm really proud of it, i've been married for thirteen years, i'm really proud that happily married, to my best friend and soul mate nothing is perfect, but, he's my best friend and i love him and i'm also proud of, my son is the mother i am and the son i raised., i'm proud of the job i did, and i'm.., i really applaud myself for it, you're welcome you were wonderful thank you, goodbye.",0
427,"<sync>, yeah sure, i'm good how are you, i'm from florida originally, mhm, where are you from, oh um, for work <laughter>, uh i haven't been back in like a few months, um, i don't know i guess it's like a smaller town than here, it was pretty easy, it's um, it's not that much of a difference except i guess the buildings are bigger <laughter>, um <tisk> i like the weather, and, uh i like the environment of like, hollywood i guess <laughter>, i hate the transportation <transporta> the transportation system, and the traffic it's really bad <laughter>, mhm, yeah i've traveled a lot around america, um i like like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff, and, uh i guess it's just relaxing and it's fun <laughter>, uh well i went to canada once my, mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there, it's pretty cold <laughter>, i didn't like that, about that particular trip, or, um, i don't know she, made us this uh like canadian food, called i think it's poutine or something and, so i guess that <laughter> that was a new experience, um, i try to get out in the sun like go to the beach or something, or read a book, um pretty, okay <laughter>, depends on how bad the situation is, um, i don't know like two days ago, i was arguing with my sister about something, oh yeah <laughter> i really don't remember it something, stupid i think she, i don't know she borrowed something from me and she didn't give it back on time <laughter>, um, i don't know i guess, i mean yeah i wish i just wouldn't lose my temper so quickly, sometimes, but that doesn't happen really often, um, i don't know i guess think more before i talk, then maybe i won't lose my temper <laughter>, um, something i wish i could erase from my memory um, i don't know i guess just, like uh negative people, or something negative people that i've met before, i guess i just wanna erase, the thought of meeting them, um well i, had like friends that were just like, not very good company and, they're just very, not very good influences so, yeah i would just wanna erase meeting them but i'm not friends with them anymore so, um, my, who's a positive influence, my family is a positive influence <laughter>, and my friends now, oh it's pretty good, i, talk to them a lot i see them a lot, so, yeah, mm, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, i don't know <laughter>, i guess um, what i wanted to study in college maybe, it's not that hard but <laughter> it's a little, it's a, big decision, computer science, thanks, yeah a little bit <laughter> not, not as much but a little bit, well i got into it it when <wh> i got into it when i was a teenager so, i guess i just, and i was good at it so i just figured, i'd go on studying it, for higher at a higher level, yeah somewhat but i, uh kinda wanted to, i was kinda trying to make a decision between that and like the arts, so, yeah i'm just happy i did it though, my dream job <laughter>, uh fashion designer <laughter>, yeah, how hard is the job, um, i don't think it's a hard job <laughter> i like clothes and, fabric and, making clothes like that so i don't think it's a hard job actually, i fall asleep like within five minutes, depending on how tired i am, i'm very irritable <laughter> and, uh, yeah i'm very irritable and, not good to be around <laughter> when i'm tired, and i can't focus, i've been feeling good fine, thanks, no, no, no, um, the last time i felt really happy, mm, i guess like, a week or so ago i went to um, i went to, where did i go, i went to this event, downtown, it was like a, art walk thing so it was exciting, thanks, oh it was just like different, art um galleries and stuff downtown, they're just exhibiting their work and, i don't know it was just interesting to walk around and see all that, um, i think i'm, generous, um, patient, i think, i'm a good friend <laughter>, um, i think i'm hard working, and, what else, yeah i, that's that's it i think, um, i wish i was more outgoing, like more sociable person, and, um, what else, i don't know and i wish i was like i guess not um, not easy to um, anger like, get a temper or something, oh no not in trouble it's just, sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people, um getting <get> getting a having a temper, but i've never gotten in trouble or, mm, really badly no, um, i can't <laughter> think of um i guess, i was in, i was in a um <tisk> elevator one time and this person, like was running towards it, and, like like i was trying to hold it for them, but i couldn't reach it in time and they like started cursing me out <laughter> so like i felt really bad 'cause they probably thought i didn't try to open it for them, but, yeah, it was that <laughter>, um, anything i regret <clears throat> not really i well yeah i regret um, not, contacting like old friends that i knew, so i guess yeah maybe i'll do that in the future, i know them from like elementary school, yeah but we lost contact through the years, 'cause i switched schools, <clears throat>, for now i mean, oh okay um, i don't know i guess i would just say, um, learn as much as i can and, i don't know just, don't hold back so much, with like um, like not being, outgoing and stuff i guess i'd just tell myself to be, more outgoing <laughter>, um, i think they'd say the same thing i said earlier that i'm generous, patient, hard working, and, what else did i say, um, kind <laughter> i hope they'd say that, <sigh>, mm, i am proud of my intelligence, okay, okay bye, take care",5
