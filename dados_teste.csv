301,"thank you, mmm k, i'm doing good thank you, i'm from los angeles, oh great, i live in west los angeles the west side, it's alright, i , no i live alone so, i love it i'm from here so i grew up here it's natural, the weather um well the weather, it's always good it's never it's never bad uh um there's always something to do it's rarely a dull moment, the traffic, the traffic is horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic, not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if i travel it's usually somewhere that's within driving distance, i studied uh business, i did, no i've i've been done for a few years so i haven't gone to school for a while, one of these days i'll go back to graduate school but, my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um, i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can, i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment, um, i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult, yep, i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so, it's just basically i get sent out to do uh, to do desk jobs , um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so , you know yeah, i'm pretty close i mean they're around so, um god really mad, stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me, um, that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all, um what's a good example, just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific, situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so, uh god, i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back, what do you mean, okay, god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym, listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so, anything of that sort i like, i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative, who's been a positive <pos>, i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and, which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't, it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so, i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there, you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently, instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time, um i guess it depends on who you talk to, i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that, um, i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it, well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me, but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress, lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better, no, no, no, um, nothing major, i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean, those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know, but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but, but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so, yeah, so, um i think, i think my, in my life i knew that, i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with, so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of, mmm kind of answered itself so, no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense, it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you, memorable experiences um hmm, i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that, i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able, i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like, i've gotten somewhere, maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire, yeah, um, when was the last time i really felt happy, um, i don't know i'm not really someone who's like, i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i, i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so, i guess to answer the question probably, mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy, i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends, i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty, determined, i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible, so, i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as, okay, no problem, alright, bye",3

328,"yes, <laughter> , fine how are you, uh watts california but now i live in west l_a , <laughter> yes, i love uh the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that um you're thirty minutes away from everything it's a great city , the traffic it's terrible , i studied child development , yeah actually i uh teach children how to be safe in uh traffic situations , oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies , well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film, <laughter> , last time i made a film just this last october made a short film , <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally, thanks <laughter> , really mad uh , <laughter> really mad i, you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad , yeah , <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school , no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that, you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you, you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um, other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy , <sigh> , the hardest thing about being a parent , i would say is, trying to give, that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so, it gets very uh , um, annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt, it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so , mm, yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch, but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it, you as a parent you're happy they got it , <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they , yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs, she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but, you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for, having the children tell you that you're a good person so, i like that , hmm, oh <laughter> my god they're, ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity, and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but, they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or, you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information, and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed, and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong, hmm, me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation , argued , i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about, gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember , it was petty, yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it, hmm, my fiancee, <laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at, at a charter <ch> not a charter school but at a, recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didn't see each other for an entire year, and then uh we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since, my family we're pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um, as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away and, um but my immediate family like you know my fiancee and my daughter like we're close and it's great, <laughter>, i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience , yeah , i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like, just being away from it all that's that's good too, well i went to new zealand uh not too long ago and i had <ha>, stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius 'cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket , uh i learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak, and um i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they had a lot of lamb oh and their seafood <seaf> seafood i can't eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is <sigh> it was so good, and ice cream was good too and uh the people were really really nice they it was a very special time for me to go there it was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back , <laughter> yes it was, some of my best qualities um, energetic uh very personable uh intelligent, i am easy to get along with i work pretty hard, and i'm very slow to getting upset about things , no , no, no, mm it's fairly easy , <laughter> uh i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have, lack of sleep but once i get some sleep in me i'm okay, mm fine , no no no changes no, , um, you know he would say that i'm pretty funny um lax about a lot of things uh i enjoy life as much as i possibly can, um good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help, <laughter> just waking up in the morning <laughter> it's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good, i love laughing ugh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee 'cause she has a great laugh then, that puts me in a good mood, hmm, thank you , , and that's what i wanna do i definitely wanna get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so he's been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble, um he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging , oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend , yeah , <laughter> yes it is , wow there's so many uh , , had uh these bag of m and m's and we had went to a play, and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are you just they don't know how to you know they say they don't like somebody but you know, anyway but we got these m and m's and while the it was dark we start throwing m and m's and hitting 'em in the head with the m and m's and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial, to get, , so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime, and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days , oh man you name it uh i love scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it wanna get back into it like traveling, uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it, that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so, that's about it hanging out with family , anything i regret hmm <deep breath> you know what i think i <laughter> i probably regret, not, going up to will smith when i had the chance , yeah uh will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and, i didn't meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him , advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago, i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more , really happy , hmm, really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house, i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago , yeah , <sigh> let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and, i didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and i'm i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good, shot and i

350,"yes , i'm doing fine thank you , originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi , yes , i didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents , <laughter>, uh when i was two years old , <laughter> yes i was i was a toddler , yes i like to travel and i travel a lot , um being around new environments and new people uh different things , <cough>, um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa, in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people , a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way , i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget, <laughter> , i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students , uh not currently no, well right now i um tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher , mhm, wow, anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so, yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that , um , occasionally yes <laughter>, um <clears throat> , i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know , mm, well , i don't know i read um i just started meditation , mm try to breathe and calm down <laughter>, yeah , some things that make me really mad, um , mistreatment of children , abuse of children , um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can, control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all , oh i'm fine i can totally <to> in at controlling my temper i think so i don't have a yeah , the last time i argued with someone , was um , i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um, it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so <laughter> , yeah , <laughter>, this is cool, uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day , there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences , well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her , because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children , and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to , you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to , you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible , no i have not , no, i have , um well i was diagnosed um, within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months , well, um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling, and not knowing um, you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling , there were a lot of symptoms um , um, you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight, um i couldn't sleep a lot, and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um , felt sad sometimes , like i wanted to cry a lot , i've been feeling okay, um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so, i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get , out and do more things , um , no no it's no no i haven't , not any different from, before what i was experiencing before , no , mm, well mm i was receiving um , uh i guess psychotherapy and um, i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda , got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while , uh sometimes , i do , yes it is, it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep, i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind, that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep, mhm, um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps, other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping , it, tired <laughter> , yeah mostly uh tired um, kinda confused , i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um , last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays , uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me, and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um, that's about it , how would my best friend describe me probably as um , quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious , um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and, they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or, um easy to talk to um, that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them , <laughter> , um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff , to just , relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people, because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you, are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their , their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just, believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be , yeah , um really enjoyed working with um well , okay, a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball, um being the first to attend college in my family, and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so , uh i'm most proud of being able to , have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and, help someone else improve and better themself as well , goodbye",11
355,"yes, alright , i was born in uh los angeles california , uh well the weather and uh , the fact that uh people aren't so obtrusive like on the east coast , uh, just the uh the traffic and the, the smoggy weather , i used to i'm unemployed now so i rarely go anywhere , i have a b_s in uh business with a uh computer uh, option, i thought that the only place i could get a job with a business <bu> business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods so i took that i took business computer methods option , oh i'd probably be like uh, a professional sports player or an actor something something that you enjoy doing , i like to uh, ride my bike i like to watch sporting events now i can't afford to go to them, so i pretty much watch on t_v , i like to travel but like i say that i don't have money for that anymore , that's alright , uh <sigh> people who are chicken heads they get their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers you expect that from a family member, or or a friend but you know, especially with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in nineteen eighty four , uh i don't do much, much different than i would otherwise , uh and i've had many temper outbursts, uh , i kinda argue with my aunt , and it was because she was basically , making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative, and uh it annoyed me greatly , uh i'm kind of on the outs with my parents , i'm kind of the black sheep , oh uh i mean my mom's done the most to help me, she's done a lot, you know more than uh anybody by far, well i mean she's just , i remember one time when i was in like thirteen i went with a friend of mine to see the crosby stills nash and young concert at the forum , and she has seven kids and she picked me up at the sizzlers right across the street from the forum at uh eleven o'clock at night and i couldn't imagine, with all she had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did , oh probably uh , going down to the cape at the end of uh baja peninsula there's cabo san lucas, or taking <ta> photographing the bridalveil falls in yosemite , uh it was probably the two most majestic seen <see> sights i've ever seen , it was when i could afford to travel , no, no, i was, diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in april of two thousand eleven , and uh i took some lexapro but i stopped after one day i didn't wanna do it anymore , no, because i didn't feel it was helpful i feel i was becoming a zombie , yeah , depressed about not having a job for over two years i lost my job in october two thousand and ten and except for, day you know jobs like this which i'm fortunate to get just you know daily things focus groups like that i haven't worked , thank you , especially when you're fifty six years old , well mm, eh just uh it just the i guess the general feeling of hopelessness , i get out on my bicycle a lot and walk or bike just four hours a day split about two hours each , yeah good to get some, very easy , 'cause now i'm old when i was young i couldn't sleep more than six <s> four six hours a night , because i'm restless , no, but now that i'm old i i i sleep much more easily , i pray before i go to sleep, and that's that's that's when i can't have any trouble sleeping i just pray, recite different prayers like the lord's prayer hail mary stuff like that and i'm able to fall off to sleep , i don't know probably uh , can't have any specific remembrances , of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably, fifteen years ago , well, i haven't really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh, made seventy five dollars on a job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play, the basically the relatives of people who had been in a in a, fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told 'em gave 'em the information i'm missing , you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county, and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a , not not hard it was just uh, just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually, missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera , i don't have a best friend , uh , i'm uh very bright, i'm a, perfectionist at my job , i'd say that's about it , i got a business degree and i've never been a motivated person i went to school i went to, two state colleges and two, junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution <con> contribution that i i made to my , you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall , yeah i regret you know , alienating family members , i would've uh , basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs thinking <think> thinking that , you know i could always get another one and not you know, basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now , they've added locations but i burned bridges there so that's not possible , thank you , hasta luego",10

364,"i am, i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee, and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today, i was born and raised in los angeles, and i'm one of the few locals from around here, and uh i went to school away and uh, but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles, yes i am, i like the weather, having owned a vacation house in another state, that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here, um i like the culture i like the diversity, i like the familiarity, i like that beaches, uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert, but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that, and uh i think it's a great place to live, thank you, well, more of some maybe some of the, things i don't like about l_a or say california in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now, which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations, i'm a small business owner, so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated, and uh that's a big problem here in uh, uh california, it really does most people don't understand it but it's uh, also uh, you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't, see that but it's a big tax on the social service system, and that's what makes our taxes, uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of, so that's, you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state, i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries, and uh, i don't travel as much as i used to, but i've traveled quite a bit, and i've learned a couple of languages and uh, i served, i'm sorry, uh, i didn't really understand uh your question, when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and, i've been all through europe eastern europe, asia, south america, north africa, um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf, 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up, and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga, and work out and uh, i try to eat healthy and uh, that's a big part of my life, oh, sure, um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span, but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times, we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local, and rented a small flat and, cooked and did our own shopping but really, having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days, it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city, and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french, which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger, my mother insisted that all of us kids, take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh, all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school, so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french, with the french, you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me, <laughter> so that was a, uh, i have a few different degrees, so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate, and uh, that was fun, and i also have a masters, uh degree in economics, and i have a degree in crisis management, so, uh i found them um, interesting, and uh, it was something that i wanted to do, where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports, and i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland, and i originally wanted to be a doctor but, once you start going to school, for a little bit you change your mind, etcetera so, um i'm actually in the wholesale business now, for wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago, well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business, and it's, pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past, hm, actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home, and uh, uh, i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter, and uh, you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked, but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids, you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life, so, probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun, uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable, i think i'm more of an extrovert, whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted, but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation, and be more um, introverted, i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved, oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh, one of my i have uh several computers at home, and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well, i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes, it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years, i had, it uh, i usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>, but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but, yes that was uh, that was it but, that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills, i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years, i think i've gotten better, uh at the, i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature, as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and, be a little more, how do you had had the skills earlier, i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged, um, you know i, i am more likely to think before i speak now, whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought, so i might've said more things that i, in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or, a work situation, um, but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it, i think i'm a lot better at that now than i was say in my teens or twenties, so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity, oh wow, you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional, argument um, probably, um, my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter, and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just, basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting, and uh just, uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused, us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument, but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree, butt heads, so, i felt like i was talking to a wall, and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've, learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should, usually have but you're not really thinking of that because, sometimes when we're younger we're, looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me, but you know, i'm pretty easy going and i have, different, ideas on raising children how she did, and that was more, not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really, discussed those things but it was really just fundamental, reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good, you know on paper to both of us, hm, there's one recently my father passed away uh recently, thank you, and, really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days, and i really only invited very very close friends and family members, i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of, not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a, i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact, that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known, about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but, now as time's passed i wish i'd invited, more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just, and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because, i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but, i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little, they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that, you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less, doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really, mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so, um well both my parents are recently, uh deceased in the last couple of years, and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away, in december, and, we're not super close like i always like i look at other families, we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting, i guess we're also uh different, and uh, i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family, not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that, we just, never did that because we're all, all so uh, uh different, yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but, you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know, but i think every family has their own sort of, stuff, um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from, some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from, you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was, but i think i function, pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years, i didn't enlist i was an officer, i went to one of the service academies, that, um seventeen i started when after high school, and i went to a service academy, so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into, i was but same age as everybody else that went there, uh we did, nineteen eighty three, um, just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just, we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled, at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so, that was a, it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh, too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation, that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you, you actually play in the game and the same with uh, you know if you're in a combat, unit, well it made me more patriotic having grown up, in california, whereas people who are from all over the country, and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did, never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i, ended up becoming uh, just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or, georgia north dakota south dakota montana, grows up with that kind of uh, pride so i thought it was good and it, unlike so many of my friends that, they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan, uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school, and i got two graduate degrees, and i went to work in private enterprise, uh, didn't care for it, then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic, for a number of years and, then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell, um, at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked, and again i was an officer, uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile, to be able to come back to los angeles, uh, because it was just so uh, so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality, so but, it was a great experience, um, it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late, and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well, even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um, but i generally sleep uh, i generally sleep pretty well, i feel pretty good lately, you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but, boy the last few months i feel great pretty much, no not really, i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately, um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it, and, you know, it wasn't, anything real too debilitating, and i wasn't able to really function, on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling, i do i was really against it in the past, and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh, my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past, i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous, and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it, oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about, life relationships, and sometimes it's good talking things out with a, a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger, so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and, i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that, uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off, i do have someone that i go to, yeah, i think it's nice, you know they really, if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped, they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's, always in the past they just help you talk through your, your thoughts, and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity, to the situation that's why i like, talking to someone who has a lot more life experience, and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man, so but it's, um, i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and, was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you, but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good, uh this morning, i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and, family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather, and i have a bunch of errands to run, and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out, and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold, where i always i know that term so, but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day, and i looked forward to feeling the sun, so, uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects, i'm too smart for my own good, and i'm a, i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational, i'm very resourceful, people always call me when they have issues, and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go, whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or, you know i'm great with medical diagnoses, uh, and uh, you know people also say i'm a lot of fun, i'm fun to be with, and um, i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white, i am what i am, i don't b_s, you know, i'm the opposite of a politician, so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them, so that's pretty much, no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully, i like to think i do, uh, probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy, uh, i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger, uh, but just a lot of it's very typical, really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive, or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now, i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking, in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices, um i'm proud of my daughter she's, a nice young lady i am uh, proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my, military service and fire service, um there are very few people like me who did it, who are as, had the background in education that i did but i like public service, and um, so i'm proud of uh that, proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees, sort of like trophies, i'm proud that i've been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and, knock wood maintain good health, it was nice meeting you, bye bye thank you",0
366,"yeah, i'm great, and you, uh los angeles california, uh <sigh> i like the diversity, i feel l_a by itself is a country there's so much to do so much to explore, and uh there's nothing like it, traffic <laughter> uh i would say traffic and the real estate prices are kinda crazy compared to the rest of the country, but other than that then you know it's fine, i have traveled um i have traveled a bit, um i would like to travel more though so but i've traveled to i've been to a few countries, um i've been to, i won't say europe that's a continent um i've been to uh london <deep breath> um i was born here but my family's from nigeria so i've been to nigeria, a few times i've been to denmark, um amsterdam, i've been to uh where else have i gone uh germany, um, and i think that's i think that's it yeah think that's it, yeah, just exploring uh exploring <exp> exploring new places um seeing new things meeting new people a different culture, it's definitely um, um, gives you an appreciation for life, and the diversity of it and also um going to countries that may not be, as developed as the u_s it definitely it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know this country, yeah, okay well <sigh> uh let's see london i accident actually when i first heard about going to london i really didn't care for it 'cause i didn't know much about it the only i thing i remember <mem> i remember, is watching mary poppins <laughter> and um, but um when i went there i absolutely fell in love with it um just <deep breath>, it still <sti> it has the hustle and bustle of l_a, but at the same time you can go at a very very slow pace um we didn't do any driving we just, went on the tube, um which is their like the underground subway station which i absolutely fell in love with, and um, just exploring um different parts of the city we went to you know big ben westminster abbey, uh they actually had when i went there they had the premiere of um what movie was this um, slumdog millionaire, and also they had the premiere for um, seven seven pounds it was a movie with will smith, um they did so will smith was over there and we were you know, me and my friends were like kinda like screaming like we were like groupies <laughter> just you know just <laughter> just <laughter> just to you know for antics but um yeah it was it was a lot of fun it was a lot of fun, yeah, uh business management and an option in human resources management what that means i have no idea <laughter>, um, good question, i've always, i've always wanted to go into business um, and i've always wanted to study finance but, i didn't think i would learn too much about finance from, college per se i think i've learned more in the real world whatnot, so the other option was human resource and i'm always fascinated about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so i went for that, no <laughter> well i still i still kinda use what i've learned but i i work in property management, so um, it still has to do with people anything to do with people i'm fascinated about, so, yeah, that was a good one um, my dream job wow, i would say being a life coach, i would uh yeah i would say that would my dream job because i love helping people become successes and i help, i love being a part of someone else's success even no regardless of how small it is, um whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation, i like um i just help <hel> like helping people have a better life so i think uh, you know but i do it for free i'd do it for free like all day, yeah, yeah, more outgoing, definitely more outgoing i'm usually um, the life well it's it's weird 'cause i'm usually considered like the life of the party i'm the one who's cracking jokes and making everybody laugh at the same time i can be very very, quiet and to myself, so, yeah, right, <sigh> to relax i usually listen to music, i usually listen to music to relax me or i, pray, to to relax myself or listen to some really calm music, so, yeah, very good, very very good i used to uh, i wouldn't say it was a bad temper but i was known to um, go off quote on quote <laughter> not in a not in a you know not throwing chairs or anything like that but, i'm a very very patient person, but once that patience <patien> is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it's done i, i just go off, no mm mm, no, <sigh> the last time i argued with someone <some> wow i haven't argued with somebody in a long time, um <sigh>, boy, mm, uh i argued with my, no, i would say my i think it my dad i argued with him, um, about <sigh> what was it about, um, we were disagreeing on some things about when we were gonna supposed to go back to nigeria, and, he wasn't listening to, it was a kind of like a group discussion myself and my my siblings, and he was being very subjective he wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns, so um it started an argument, uh very, uh, i wouldn't say angry per se but i felt very, kinda like i was losing control, like um i'm the type where i i like to be in control of my emotions and of my thoughts and i feel, once that patience is gone and i start going off it's kinda like this, this uh, you know, i won't call it a blur but, i'm very witty and quick with what i say so, i will instantly say something that you know, up not necessarily hurtful but um very direct and to the point and i make sure i get my point across, yeah, um i have three brothers one one younger two older i'm very close with my family and my mom is one of my best friends, um <sigh>, my brothers are great um, love 'em to death, uh my father eh he's moreso out of the picture, yeah, i don't i don't really i'm not the guilty type <laughter> i don't feel, guilty i'm not one to shy away from what i've done and i definitely own up to what i do i'm not one to shy away from responsibility but i don't think i ever feel, guilty, for anything i do, yeah i don't think i feel i i usually don't feel guilty, yeah, pretty pretty easy, um pretty easy at <a> at, yeah i'm pretty good at falling asleep except when i'm excited and when i'm reading <laughter> when i'm trying to when i'm when i'm focused on learning something like i'll read and read and read, even when it's past my bed time, but now i'm trying to work on, waking up much earlier, then when i am now and that's kind of a struggle <st> a little bit of a struggle but i'm getting to it so, good, um, i've been feeling i've been feeling fine you know i'm generally i have a very very happy disposition, and so, no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever if i feel do feel like i'm going, i don't allow myself to go to that place, nah, no, sorry, thoughts, i would say, well <we> it's i wouldn't say necessarily changes but i'd say moreso behaviors learning how to, let go of past decisions, maybe and kinda how they they played their course in my life, um, i just sometimes i kinda look back and say what if i did this what would've, how would life be now, no, so the those are some games i play but other than that, that's it, hmm <laughter>, regret, uh, no, no mm mm there isn't anything i regret, <sigh> ten to twenty years ago, i would say don't be afraid of who you are, um be authentic, um, more importantly with yourself, hmm erase from my memory, uh, boy that's a good one, hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm, uh, wow, erase from my memory, uh, i would say when i told <t> when i told my dad that he should act like a father, maybe i shouldn't, yeah there was um, that was actually one of the times i <laughter> another time i went off usually with him um, uh, basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college, um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother, and um <sigh> my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like, uh four a_p classes, i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field, so, needless to say i was <laughter> i i i i was kinda like burning myself, i was kinda like burning myself out, and um, i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too, and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time, so um, and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone, um so uh, um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out, at that point in time so i'm just gonna you know, you know just just, take the, d or fail whatever, and he didn't he didn't like that 'cause he is a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's what maybe where it came from he's a teacher as well um, and so, he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him, you know since you're my father you should act like it, but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so, that was um, one thing, oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing, um and that is i wish i continued, um with college throughout, like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at, i wanna say nineteen, 'cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year, in high school, but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would've, continued maybe that's one small thing but, that's something small though, yeah, hmm, i'm very, um i'm a very compassionate and understanding person, um, i like learning new things um i'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice i'm very objective, i'll tell you the good the bad the ugly, and um, yeah those are some of my best qualities yeah, and i'm fun i like to have fun i'll have fun in any situation i can make light of any situation like i'm the kinda type <ty> type of person i can break the tension in the room that's sort of, that sort of uh <tisk> um, personality trait, yeah, wish i was taller <laughter> um, uh besides my height, hmm, i wish, ah, maybe, i don't know if it's uh, be more, i won't say be more in touch with my emotions but i think, i would say, understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes, i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person, where, people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i don't realize how much, they do i think that's a realizing how much they care and love me, that's one thing i would like to, get more, of a, grasp on, <laughter> my best friend <deep breath> uh she describes me as someone who's funny, crazy, um, objective, um loyal, um ambitious hardworking um, mean <laughter> when i just make jokes she says you're so mean but um, just <sigh> i just i <laughter> i i just like to i joke around all the time and so um, we were right now we're actually planning um uh, a friend of mine or a friend of ours um a baby shower, i'm giving her some ideas and there's another friend who was invited who, we had some issues in the past and someone i don't talk to or hang out with we used to be really close but i don't really talk to that person but i don't mind them being there, so she also talked about having <havi> celebrating her birthday, also at kinda like after the baby shower, and there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we really <rea> didn't do anything for and i'm like well if we're celebrating this person's birthday might as well we should definitely, you know honor this person's birthday as well since we're closer to you know the person birthday's passed, and i said you know what just why <wh> don't we celebrate everybody's birthday, <laughter> forget the baby shower just do the birthdays, and then <laughter> that's when that's when she said you're so mean <laughter> but she was laughing about it so, yeah, yeah, uh <sigh> most proud of in my in my life <deep breath>, uh <sigh>, i would say being there for my family, being being a a mentally and emotionally strong person, family's gone through a lot of challenges and a lotta times i've been the one to make sure, everything goes okay and everything make sure <su> everything <everythi> make sure everything goes accordingly, um so i'd say more than anything making sure i was there for my family, yeah, oh, okay thank you, bye have a good one",0
370,"yeah, i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you, uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley, yeah, uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um, the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um, camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like, eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that, that i i i would say i like that too, uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um, and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know, that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but, that's fine, wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter>, i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow, make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but, that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if, if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things, and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun, well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be, eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um, i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also, fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um, so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great, uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last, trip i i, took um, lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um, well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um, austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age, so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um, like, tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life, i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and, so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my, my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to, traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and, it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it, uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so, i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like, familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um, maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh, like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that, uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really, relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and, i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax, i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so, i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um, yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't, i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all, the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh>, i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about, things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict, as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um, really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't, sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing, something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um, i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um, i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not, even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or, running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait, waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true, um <sigh> hmm, um nothing immediately comes to mind i, well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh, was um, driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know slow, rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like, reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but, it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they, you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um, <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened, it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck, well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh, i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up, 'til one or two every night uh and, it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were, more um, able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven, and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to, going to sleep later and waking up later, i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um, you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh, um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that, no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um, everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening, no, no, well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh>, in my life uh yeah like i said i, i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i, there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh, i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we, we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life, i would say that um <sigh>, it's important to, to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um, recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from, the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um, kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which, eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um, that approach it's kinda fatalistic, and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that, it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of, you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place, um <sigh>, well i <sigh>, i i guess when people i i don't especially um, take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that, so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is, uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized, i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should, uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody, just out of uh college you know um, went over what we had done and, you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and, i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh, it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um, i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh, not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of, you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that, the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but, you know it wasn't our call <sigh>, mm most memorable experiences um, well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um, the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um, for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest, period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i, i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um, and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun, uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we, we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty, happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been, very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so, yeah, yeah thank you <laughter>, uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um, sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh, you know um, helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh>, intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh, i, what else i think that um my best friend might say that, uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i, also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans, mm, uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um, hmm <tisk>, well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that, um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um, my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh, i'd say maybe the fact that, it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that, no problem have a good day thank you, goodbye",0
390,"yes, i'm doing pretty well um, i have some stressful circumstances going on but um, um right now i'm i'm engaged, i'm from minnesota, mhm, uh thirty one years ago, half my life, um, frequently i've been back there quite a bit, um but over the years not not that often, um, well it's a a whole different experience you know i i got back there to see my my family and and old friends and uh, so it's uh, l_a is, is home it's nice to return here, uh to be an actor, uh i'm just actually getting around to it i, was in another business for uh, twenty five years and um, now <clears throat> finally i can't put it off anymore, um the economy um it's as easy to find work in uh show business it seems as, it is any thing any of the other jobs i've done in the past, um oh a whole variety of things um but mostly uh having to do with theater, uh, well to to be a successful actor you know would be nice and, uh outgoing, with elements of shyness, um, well i i, i read and i cook, and um, um, that's mm that's about it uh, uh, i oh i'm a big radio listener is uh to uh, um talk radio uh, national public radio and uh, more uh, and not uh, crazy stuff um the sensible, listening uh nice content uh interesting human interest, uh mhm, oh um, well i'm i also i i, um, a comedian <cuh> comedian and so i like to listen to radio shows that have comedy, mhm, like uh, um, i'm pretty good i mean i'm not perfect but i i i i can get very upset, oh probably with my wife about um, my uh, <clears throat> methods of of job hunting and like that, it's um, it's difficult um, she uh um, we're we're very different and uh have very different, m_o's and uh, so uh, uh, for me to uh, um, do things my way is is not always easy, oh um, well just the other night i i was uh performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to uh introduce myself to a, a very famous person and i um i didn't do it, um, uh i'm not sure i'm i guess uh, i didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him, hm, i can't think of uh, i can't think of one um, um, well, i've been married for it'll be twenty four years in uh july, which is a couple of months and um, uh my wife and i have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years, and um, but we have a uh, a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school, uh this this spring and um she's just a, uh, gotten accepted at a college that she, wants to go to with a very nice uh scholarship, mhm, um yeah well, uh <laughter> my daughter's been very low maintainance for me um perhaps more so for my wife but she's always been uh an excellent uh, uh child, um, mm, well we're more similar i think than different uh i'm well i'm much more uh, aware of, what's happening in the world and and much more informed than my parents were, um, but uh as in terms of child rearing i think um, i don't know we're all we've all been kind of hands off and um, uh my wife has been more hands on, um, uh well the financial responsibility it um, wanting to uh, make sure that your child has everything that, her peers have and, uh, not wanting her to uh, um, not have the same, as her friends, and she has uh, very wealthy friends so that's um, uh, i am not a uh, a gifted money maker, and, so uh it's a it's a a struggle but uh we we we keep on keep up, um, oh a couple of different um, one preacher um, uh whose church i attended for about twenty years until he died um, um was very influential and also another, spiritual guru uh, um, that uh, sort of, put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that uh, were kind of dictated by my upbringing, oh just um, well instead of working for somebody else being able to um, start a business and and be in business for yourself and and to uh, um, you know not be dependent on uh, um, just one source of income, oh, meeting one particular woman um when i first got out here, um, she left me uh less than healthy, um physically, and uh, yeah, um well i, i self medicate to go to sleep, which i probably don't have to do but i um, uh about half the nights i i wake up um, much earlier than i would like to, oh usually um just mostly to have to go to the bathroom um, um, well i i i, cope pretty well i i guess i'm just not quite as functional as i'd like to be, um there are a couple of nights a week, when i work until <sniff> two o clock from in the morning and don't get to bed until three and and then i, um, normally if i i i need seven hours if i only get five or six then i'm you know sluggish and, um, very anxious, well um i have, big um, uh i have bills to pay and um not a lot of income coming in, yeah it's um 'cause i don't like to, fall behind and, um i feel like i'm, worried about losing ground and um the stakes are are high and, uh, so, uh, it's an uncomfortable position, no, um i am a classic um, depressive uh, and um, yeah i guess i have i i guess i have i see <s> i do see a therapist and uh, um, though <clears throat> mm, the mm therapist i'm seeing now is not trying to um prescribe drugs, or medications um and uh, previous ones have, uh probably, um six years ago, um, well my wife kind of pushed me into it um she thought, um, it was uh a way of, i think getting help finding work, and um, it's, not as uh it's just uh, good <g> uh uh, enjoyed uh having someone to talk to, um, not really, yeah, oh um, just uh, kind of, not wanting to uh, face the day just kind of wanting to, um, just uh kind of a weariness with the struggle uh and um, just uh i, displeasure with my life, yes, they're what, i don't understand that word, oh um, well i, um, it's, something i look forward to because um, i i feel like i'm, talking to someone who um understands me, mm, um, i i can't i i don't know um, um, well, each little um, acting gig that i get makes me, happy but uh, you know just mildly happy and they usually turn out to be disappointing experiences and so um, uh i never, over, excited <ex> excited, um with happiness uh, mm, um, well um yesterday i i made a a dessert uh to celebrate my daughter's uh scholarship and uh, it was delicious and and we really enjoyed that, mm, um, hm no um, except meeting that one woman, uh, uh, i don't know probably, try a little harder you know <fidgeting with mic>, uh, i had started this business um, um, around that time, and um, it was it was um just it was difficult but uh we were successful at it and um, uh i guess i could've gotten it, rolling even more, um, so that it wouldn't be so um, dead today, oh um, getting out of town um, going, going away when uh when uh which is rarely possible but uh, yeah, um, well my daughter's a great source of pride and um, um, the fact that i've been, pretty successful in uh my endeavors, um and now i'm just uh, going for the the big, the big apple, and uh, uh and i hope to be successful there too, okay, you're welcome, goodbye",9
392,"yes, i'm doing well, uh california, i like the weather i like the people, i don't like the traffic uh that's primarily it, sociology, yep, uh it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects, no, to be a writer, um, i like being able to write what i want to write uh right now i write things that i'm not really that interested in, like uh articles about uh, teenager culture, stuff like that, um, i think they have it pretty easy they don't know how easy they have it <laughter>, uh no not really, mm depends on the situation or who i'm around when i first meet people i can be shy uh but if it's someone i've known for a while i can be outgoing, um i'll lay down or try some sort like deep breathing, or uh just maybe do something that's kinda fun and mind numbing like watch t_v, i'm pretty good i don't really let anger show that much um, i'm not like a i don't have a fiery temper or anything like that i'm pretty rational, um, i actually can't remember when the last time i argued with someone was 'cause it's been so long, um, i guess i feel guilty about the fact that i don't talk to my grandparents as much as i should, um i'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family, uh 'cause they basically sort of raised me uh and uh my parents, weren't, really in the picture that much, um <sigh>, i can't really think of one, right now, uh, i guess uh when my sister died it was really traumatizing, mhm, yeah, yes, um, i guess the hardest decision i've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband, uh because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but i still felt like i should stick it out, i mean it was hard at the time uh but, i made the right decision i think, uh my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age, um she's just a very strong powerful, uh sort of staunch character, and that rubbed off on me, uh not really super easy um, i sort of i mean it's my probably my fault i go to bed too late, just sort of foggy and distracted, i have trouble concentrating, you mean like my body, uh, normal, fine, no complaints, no, it's been the same as ever, no, no, uh, last night i was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff, uh probably funny and uh easy to get along with but also caring, uh i spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies watching t_v, uh, no, i don't think, there's not i don't <do> i don't think uh i think regretting <r> regretting things is a waste of time, um, don't try to, don't go out of your way to try and impress people, if, they like you then they like you, um, sometimes, sometimes i can be kinda lazy, uh, i'd like to have more of a um like sort of uh, better work ethic i guess, uh just sort of putting off stuff um until you know right when it's due or after it's due things like that um procrastinating, uh <sigh>, sometimes for the things that i write uh people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website, and that'll make me feel bad, i'm uh articulate, and funny and a good friend, um, i guess i'm most proud of the fact that uh, i, am satisfied with, myself, and my friends and my status in the world, i'm proud of the fact that i feel comfortable with it, um just hanging out with my friends uh, sort of people watching, watching a movie that's good, um, listening to music, mhm, bye",1
401,"yes i'm okay, i'm good i'm a little tired but i'm good, michigan i'm from michigan, um, a long time ago, then i left, uh, once twice a year, cold <laughter> very cold, because i wanted to pursue my acting career, uh, well, it wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity, it was the options, more options, uh the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy, <sigh> let's see, besides the weather, i like that, things are more convenient, i like some of the people here um, <laughter> that are actually from home but um, yeah i i just i like i like that it's a little laid back, that's about it, i don't like the traffic, i don't like um, uh the gang violence, in certain areas and i don't like, <sigh> what else don't i like, huh, maybe that's that's all i don't like, i don't oh you know i like i don't like that it's so far away from home i wish, i wish l_a was, kinda midwest <laughter> i wish it wasn't so far from home, i have a close relationship with my family, um, it's a small uh immediate family is really small, and we're close my grandmother recently passed so it's um <tisk> an adjustment right now, but i'm close to my family, well i can't see your shoes but i do travel often, i do travel yes, um getting there <laughter> i like getting there um once i'm at the wherever i'm going i like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and, people, uh okay i oh i went to um france a few years ago well many years ago and a little town called carcassonne and was very um, it was it was actually really fun but very much like a story book as far as what i expected to see and what i actually saw, like i what i remember that i really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there are no windows in the buildings but, they are these shutters that most places in the united states have inside of windows they have them outside of the windows and there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool <sniff> i like that, i'm borderline, sometimes i'm shy sometimes i'm outgoing it depends on who and what the situation is, um music i turn on music i walk, through the neighborhoods you know, i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not a, um hot head at all, hm, oh it was an ex roommate, and it was about my loyalty as a friend, yeah um pretty much she um, thought that because i wanted my rent, which she agreed to pay, that, i was not, being a good friend that i should just let her live for free and, that wasn't going to happen, so you know, the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway, even after she didn't pay me, so that's a friend, i could've kicked her out i didn't, she left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but, you know, could've um, could've could've been a bad situation but there was an argument there, a real a real one, i wish i had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when, we agreed to be roommates temporarily, and, um gotten my money upfront, that's what i wish i had done and i just i didn't my mind told me to go along with it, no my mind told me to get the money upfront, but i didn't, so, mm, the hardest decision, um, i think i have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like, <tisk<> maybe um leaving home, leaving home when i was years ago when i was like eighteen, yeah, um, i felt like i was abandoning my family, <laughter> that's what i felt <laughter> but um they encouraged me to go on and live my life, mhm, uh something that i could erase from my memory, probably, a friend, who, i was um, uh dating, i would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when i told him my grandmother um was ill, um it's easy if i'm busy all day and i'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so, it's not that easy actually it's not that easy, i'd have to, because i have to, be exhausted, i have to be exhausted, to be exhausted, no, it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long, irritable, up and down, up and up and down like sometimes i've, been excited and anxious and on the other side i'm like, mm, what am i doing, yeah it's just an anxiousness to wanna make some things happen, some goals, and um, uh, getting certain kind of work, and, um having a certain amount of um, income, and uh, just taking care of myself you know the way i think i should, take care of myself just the physical stuff, eating right and everything, yeah, i have, um sometimes i have a lot of, distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what i need to be focused on in the moment, and i'm conscious of that i'm like of all the things that's popping up in my head why am i thinking about that, uh i i let them happen and then i i try to think about other things and, phase it out it pops back up i phase it out, yeah, no, no, uh, when the roommate moved out, i was really happy when she finally left, um probably reading, and maybe go out go dancing that would be ideal i can go dancing go salsa dancing, and yeah, mm, my ability to make a decision quicker, and to act on it, really badly, uh i don't know if i have a time that someone has ever made me feel really badly, i don't, feel bad about, much, uh, as courageous, that would be it in a nutshell, in general, um, i regret not making some different decisions when i was younger as far as, moving forward with as far as um career stuff and, um relationship things i wish i had done some things, earlier in my life that i'm doing now, uh really going after some of my personal goals and, um, deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long term and, yeah i wish i had done that earlier, twenty years ago i would have, giving given myself the advice to, um, continue, with my schooling, um beyond what i did, and, to be more discerning in my choices of individuals who i allow in my life, um, being a part of the family that i'm a part of, thank you, goodbye",9
405,"hello, yes, okay, not, too bad, i'm from chicago, south side, um back in nineteen seventy eight, when i was eighteen, yes <y>, lately, not much maybe once every two or three years, um it's totally different you know, horrible weather and uh, yeah it's just a whole different atmosphere, um, let's see my mother had moved to africa, i graduated from high school, and i had a friend out here so i just thought well let me try l_a, uh very easy actually yeah i loved it from the moment i got off the airplane, yeah, number one the weather, um sun is very important to me, so i love the weather, um i don't know just kind of a more laid back atmosphere, variety, of people, and now it's my um, my home base you know, my, friends, that are family, so it's kinda like my family is here now, hmm, i guess the smog earthquakes, um, traffic, just basic things like that really, um i don't currently but i did throughout my life i traveled, quite a lot, uh just seeing, seeing, other cultures and, seeing um more history and, meeting people and, just fun and the the fun of it as well, um let's see well one trip, i went to, england, ireland and scotland and france all in, you know, one trip, so that was a nice variety, um, i guess you could say probably skiing, in val d'isere france, that was fun, i'm glad i got to do that, i'm kind of shy by nature, i've tried to grow out of being shy so, i'm not fully shy but i was always a an extremely shy, child, but now here in culver city this is my, environment and i i guess you could say i'm not really shy in, in my hometown of culver city, hm, to relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap, watch t_v, sometimes on the couch in the living room, just you know stay at home and, kinda vegetate, uh pretty good yeah my temper's pretty level, hm, probably with my, husband, and, i can't remember at the moment what it was about, um well when you say my family do you mean, my family from childhood or my current family, okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters, and, my relationship's pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which uh, you know, going they're going through a lot of hormones and, um, they can be kinda bitchy <laughter> and, and um but i have hoped that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship, um and then there's the husband which, i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon <laughter>, we need to get a divorce but we're still together, due to financial reasons, and yeah, yeah so that that's not good the, the relationship with the husband but um, but since we have determined that we need to divorce, our our we don't expect anything out out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good, hm, well, i guess, our marriage, i wish i had noticed early on that, you know it was like way off from what i thought it was, um <sigh> let's see oh my god, hardest decision, i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard, um well you know we were married and i wasn't, content i guess you could say, um and, i kinda just, gave up on our relationship and, i i now that i look back i think it's because, i wanted, children and he would've been happy to never have any, and so uh since i didn't have a father, it was very important, that i, create children with someone who really wanted to be a father, and so i was kind of, at a age where i needed to start thinking about, having children, yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that, i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just, felt like, <tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and, so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and, <tisk> um, <tisk> and i had to leave him, because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard 'cause, you know, i felt like i was hurting him which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's married with two kids <laughter>, <laughter> but um, it was, hard, to leave him, mm, something i wish i could erase from my memory, i have to think about that, i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well, yeah there's um, i guess it'd be nice to erase, from my memory um a recent i mean not recent but an event, in my, recent adulthood here in culver city, where one of my best friends, um, i've betrayed me by, back years ago when my husband first got into real estate, she and her family were growing and they really needed a larger home, and, um, we just assumed that you know that they would use, my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time, and purchase a new home, <tisk> and as it turned out, they surprised us and, had been talking to this other local agent, and uh yeah, that was devastating, i don't think i had ever been betrayed, like that, so i wish i could erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young, and um, my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say, six maybe, um, maybe five, anyway her <h>, her and my best friend's, daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other, we were pregnant together, and um, they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd, run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were, just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her, their moms weren't talking to each other anymore, so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together, and they're still very connected in fact <laughter>, she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter, and another girl, and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now, these girls are, becoming really good friends better friends, um, and yet, i still have this, vivid, um, bad memory, of what her, her mom did to, to me, that was about what, ten, about eight years ago, anyway, <sigh> i tried to i tried to, ignore it and put it out of my head and, which i've been able to <sniff>, in recent years, but obviously it still comes up, anyway that that was that, um not that easy, i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but, sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up, and can't get back to sleep, uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that, that difficult thing, well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter>, and then um, <tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom, so i guess that's the trigger, as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there, i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind, running through my mind and the day, i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so, it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to, i guess, um, well i'm kinda used to it now, so i just go on, through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um, i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do, and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have, huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something, read my book watch t_v watch whatever, lately how have i been feeling um, kind of down, on myself down on life, well i have this pending, need <n> need for separation slash divorce, um, <tisk> i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers, you know on the verge of adulthood, and so i worry that, you know, i did all kinds of things wrong, with their guidance and their early childhood and <clears throat> now it's too late, um, like i missed out on a thing <th> a lot of things, uh, and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i wanna do with my life, i know i wanna do something i i, i just wish, you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff, so i i regret that extremely, and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself 'cause i need to, divorce and move on with my life, so, now i forget what the original question was but <laughter>, um, that's the state, part of the state of my life, no, yes, mm <tisk>, well, the first time or or or recently, the first time i guess was, you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little, upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then, i was um, <tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i, you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him, and i didn't understand this feeling, i was really upset, how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really, recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i, had the, knowledge or the, i was able to, take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour, and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me, and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as, i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter> you know, um, yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed, and put on meds, that was probably about, two years ago, no, um money i i don't have insurance, otherwise yeah i'd be happy to, go to therapy <laughter>, anything that might help, ooh <laughter>, boy, last time i felt really happy, um, i don't know i guess maybe, when my children were born, that's, um, i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just you know, i always wanted children so it was nice, to have them, that's, i don't know that's all i can remember of that i don't i guess i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times, mm, something i did that i really enjoyed, well, let's see i um, friday night i went to a friend's house, and met up with, five other girlfriends and we, we created vision boards, and talked and, had dinner, at one of their house that was that was fun, yeah, we get to, ooh <sigh>, stay in college get my degree, um, get therapy try to become a happy, um, yeah try to figure out things earlier in life, like, yeah, stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like, as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the, songs go you know, it's all about money the world revolves around money and, having none, that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life, having no money, is, you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it, so, with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree, and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it, um, don't quit, to go traveling you know, just stick with a job stick with a company build up your, seniority keep your benefits, and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field, yeah that would've been, my biggest piece of advice to myself, not much <laughter>, i guess, just my daughters you know they're, beautiful daughters and, i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people, aren't even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so, that's the one thing i mean i wanted, five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but, um i'm, i guess that's the, biggest thing i can, think of to be proud of, is having my two daughters, um, i'm a very loyal, friend and person, that's why, when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating, yeah very loyal um, very, <inhale> happy <hap> i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky <l> go lucky i don't know where that came from i'm very i meant to say friendly, and, caring and, um yeah i care about people, and i'm interested in people, and, i care about, animals as well, actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian, yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian, i'm a vegetarian because i really care about, feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and, you know i don't think that animals should be tortured, and live a a tortuous life, just so we can eat 'em, so um, what was the question, do you remember the question, okay, you're welcome, bye",17
415,"yes, i'm good, michigan, two years ago, um every three months, it's more homey and country than fast-paced and stuff, uh the i work in the entertainment business so i had to be out here, it was pretty easy because i lived in new york first and if you can survive new york you can survive l_a, the weather of course beaches, uh the people are much ruder and mean than what i'm used to but i like l_a, uh graphic design media arts, um in high school i was ahead in all my classes and credits so i had to take a college course, so while in high school i got a two year college degree doing it 'cause i was good at it, yeah, yeah but now i wanna go into something else, um i'm in school actually i take online classes now for business management, <laughter> i um a really one day i wanna own me and my sisters wanna own our own uh rental properties and, like uh, real estate company we own six houses now we bought with our college money, and now we wanna eventually one day own our own homes and apartment complexes, yeah, meeting new people seeing different things that you've never seen before um different languages everything just seeing what the world has to offer, oh okay um me and my sisters went to hawaii last year, um i believe we went to hawaii <hawa> honolulu and to, then hmm maui yeah, and we met the people in hawaii and they were so nice if i could live there i would, um, everything was memorable but probably jet-skiing, in honolulu was very fun, yeah, outgoing, music, music is much therapy for me, um well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom's family so, music has always been like that thing no matter how i feel if i put music on it makes it much better, i'm pretty good i used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes i do that too i go to the gym and i do like a kickboxing class but i don't i never escalated to the point where i like, blurt out or no i can control it pretty much, well i live with my sisters so i argue every day <laughter> but it was over clothes my sisters and clothes always clothes, um my mother my father are pastors of a church, i grew up with two sisters and a older brother who was a cop, and we're pretty close i have a nephew, we're pretty close like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house but we're together every single day at some point, when we lived in a when we lived in michigan my family eh is in michigan, um, when i cheat like right now i'm on a diet with my sisters but last night i snuck and got mcdonalds, so i feel bad because they've been so sticking to it and i cheated, but that's pretty much <laughter it, um, hmm, mm me and my when me and my a friend of mine got into it, and, we said things that weren't like we hit below the belt and we and we usually don't and we haven't spoken in like three months now, and i know that it could've been prevented if we would've just sat down and talked to each other but it didn't make it that far so, yeah, um, probably moving here, moving to l_a, because, like i'm i'm really like close <clo> we're really close with our family like i skype with my mom and dad every day, so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sisters having to do it on our own, it was much it was different, oh my goodness uh, my parents my brother, my dad my mom my sisters my family <fam> i have a great family so my family definitely, um, i wanna say, two years ago three years ago, my brother was shot on duty, and he almost lost his life but he didn't, and for some reason, as much as i try i don't tell them this 'cause i don't want them to be like i need to you know whatever, i always think about it over and over again and i'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years just the mere fact of almost losing him, kinda, yeah, not easy i work as a, personal assistant and administrative assistant for a casting agent, so i'm on call for her whenever so i'm never i never get a good night's sleep ever, i know <laughter>, um a zombie <laughter> i'm pretty much, you would never know 'cause when it's work i i'm professional so if i am tired they'd never know, but i'm very annoyed and very grouchy when i haven't slept, um <sigh>, tired, and i have crazy headaches but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much, but yeah, very tired, yeah, definitely, um i'm shorter with people like, being in the industry i mean people don't really care it's all about self, and when i first came here i had the i had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice and being here showed me that everybody's kinda out for self here, even the like the other girls i work with so i've learned to like cut people off and be short with people when that's not really me, but i just see that's how you have to be <laughter>, no, no, um <sigh>, last saturday, i did a weigh-in and i lost seven pounds i was like excited, so <laughter> that was the last time, um, care too much, uh, i think about others more than myself so she'd probably say i care too much i'm loving, i'm the person that every friend i have confide in from best friend to just regular friend, so yeah i'm the mom of my friends, um, no not no i don't regret anything, hmm, never take no for an answer, um, i wish i could, well i don't know personally i wanna lose like twenty more pounds but, uh just, i don't know be a little more, adventurous, little more adventurous, um <sigh>, i don't think i've had a time, baby feel bad no, i can't, no i don't think i have one it i'm sorry i don't think i <laughter> have one, oh um well me and my sisters has just started with yoga and, we already do the beach like every friday but, yoga is like our new addiction so we do yoga and we probably go to like a spa or something, that's an ideal <ide>, yeah, um, my my job, my career because i've gotten a pretty long way at twenty three the job i hold so i'm pretty, pretty proud of that, you're welcome, bye",3
421,"yes that's fine, i'm okay, how are you <laughter>, originally i'm from san francisco, um originally i moved here in gosh nineteen ninety five, then i went to chicago, then to san francisco and then back to los angeles probably about five years ago, a lotta moving <laughter>, never, um, there just isn't anything there for me anymore, uh the weather is better in l_a, but the people in san francisco are nicer, my husband prefers <pref> my ex-husband prefers it here that's why we moved, i have an undergraduate degree in psychology and uh after that i went to law school, uh when i was in college i worked at a law firm, and decided that i really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting, no now i'm a stay-at-home mom, , no, um, i love it but it is it is, difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they, become, a good and successful person, uh <sigh> i it's easy to kinda do the academics and stuff like that you know i'm good at that the hardest thing i think is to guide them, emotionally, to help him through things that he's having, a hard time with um feeling like i don't have all the answers, um just seeing them grow and and experience new things and, learn about life and the world it's just it's really really cool, uh completely different <laughter> um, completely different i and i am not a perfect parent but i love my son i take care of him, he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all, um well my parents are dead, i didn't speak to my dad at all before he died, um i have a sister and a brother that actually i don't know where they are i don't speak to them either, um, probably more shy because i consider myself more reserved, um i like to listen to music, i have i listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when i'm relaxing is uh eighties music <laughter> cheesy cheesy but true, um it depends on who i'm with if i'm with my son, i can control my temper, um, if i'm with, my ex-husband or other adults mm yeah <ye> yeah i don't, so-so, um yesterday, and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married, um, i found out he was cheating on me and i kicked him out, and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her, yeah, um, really angry, and just really hurt, um, i wish that i had, talked to my dad before he died i wish that i'd settled our differences before he had died, the hardest decision i've ever had to make was actually, ending my marriage, because he was cheating on me, um, that would have to be, well i don't know i mean i don't know if i'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me, who i am today, so i i can't really think of one event that i would want to erase, uh i don't get a good night's sleep it's not easy i wake up a lot in the night, i don't know i wish i knew <laughter> if i knew i i could change it, i could try to do something about it but i i just don't i don't know, um, grumpy irritable, uh grumpy irritable um, down, mixed with anger <sigh>, it's, just because of everything that i'm going through with my, soon-to-be ex-husband, yeah there's, um, i just keep it inside, i mean there's nothing else to really do except <exce> i mean it is what it is so, i have to, deal with it, no, yes, <deep breath> ten years ago after my son was born, or nine years ago um, i felt like, i couldn't cope with life, i was so down um, i couldn't i felt like i couldn't do anything, no, i don't go to therapy i go to medication management, but i don't <d> i don't do talk therapy, i have gone to therapists and no they don't help, um, well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything, um you know if i wanted to talk to myself i would, others give advice that i think is just, it just not not good and not on point, um, it was probably this morning i was playing with my son, just really happy i wasn't thinking about, any of the other crap <sigh>, um in my life i could just forget it so i was feeling really really happy, ugh, i think they would describe me completely different from the way i would describe me but, um, i think they would describe me as really sweet, uh 'cause they have really sweet um, confident, uh outgoing, because that's what i try to be to people so i think that's how they would describe me, uh i wish i wasn't sad i wish i was more confident, um, yeah there are a lotta things, i think, uh it would be, to not, not, give my life over to one particular person which is what i did with my husband, i think i would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son, hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner, uh, one of my two of my friends two really good girlfriends i think have been really positive influences in my life, um, , she <sh> her life is worse than mine and uh <laughter> but we can always commiserate together, , is just really positive i mean she's always happy always up always looking to the bright side so that has helped me a lot, my son, um i went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watched a grown-up movie and had dinner and wine, and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening, mhm, sure <laughter>, bye",10
422,"hi, sure, alright, uh originally originally i'm from uh korea, mhm, uh when i was a year old, yes, uh almost never i've i've been to korea once, uh i love the weather <sigh> and being by the ocean and the culture has a lotta things to do the food there's a lot to like, um, the traffic um, it seems like, we're having a lot of uh economic difficulties and the, the parking tickets are super high i sometimes i'm really, annoyed by our government <laughter>, by your shoes, did you say by your shoes, <laughter> your shoes aren't showing um i have traveled a bit i'm i'm sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while, oh just <sigh>, it um, it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here, um it's exciting and it makes me feel like, um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that, you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day, well um, one of my trips i went uh, i went to, singapore and then to thailand, and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um, he had <ha> he was uh, uh, a sales engineer, or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days, and that was really interesting um you know of course, eh, it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something, but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and, um, after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really, it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really, there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing, but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle, we went to um, phuket it's a little island, and it was just it was very, primitive compared to, singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap, had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>, it was interesting yeah, yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>, mm, well i'm in school right now, and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um, i had health problems, so um here i am i'm, i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c, yeah, i'm happy, ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian, but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and, in in a veterinary capacity, yeah, i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and, how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not, yeah, uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping, um, i like, like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand, or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or, a lotta times i can just lay there and, my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing, ah really good, i don't have, i would say there's certain things that um, they can really, like make me, like when i see injustices or things like that then, i mean i can really feel it, but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or, uh even you know yell <laughter>, argued, um <sigh>, i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument, like if we just, well, uh i would say last summer, when, um, i think it was after a, baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to, we went to have shabu shabu after the game, and, i don't know i think, , and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like, mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her, um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any, deep problems but um, sometimes we just have, she's very touchy, and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do, so i think, she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm, you know i just kinda, that's just how she is, and then i guess i said some things that she, felt were, eh well she gets really, offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we, then one day she called me up and then we were friends again, but like she never she never confronted me, hardest decision <sigh>, uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend, uh well, it wasn't, it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it, for like five years, um, you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just, had a lot of um, we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements, so i had thought about it and thought about it and, we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so, i don't know uh, i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally, eh we were just always having, um, we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um, we were just having these little snippy, disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and, um i did, it was really hard it was it was the hardest, decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um, and, but i i think it was for the best, <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job, for well to help my friend start a business in nevada, and when i when i, i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach, and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome, and that was really stressful for me because um, i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't, for her wanting me to come over there um, it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left, and um, when i went over there, like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah, when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and, the other principals of the company were um, you know the <th>, it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much, and also, they were a different religion, and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh, eh i was kind of an outsider there and then, also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>, so i would say that's one decision it it's, it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um, i really wish i i had just stayed, <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say, my memory, like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase, is that what you're saying, mm <sigh>, can't really think of anything i mean, even like that, that bad decision that i made, you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something, and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't, being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but, i never feel rested and that's um, it's a medical problem of mine, well i always feel, like i haven't slept for two days and, um, there are points in in the day, i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and, and rested but they're short-lived, but i sleep a lot i sleep, uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy, yeah, well thanks <laughter>, no, i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um, that's, that's usually what doctors, um, like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and, figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep, but i do, i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well, my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down, um, i would say that i do feel down sometimes, a lotta times but it's not, i would say, it's reasonable considering, the situations that i'm in, uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult, but um, i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular, oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've, find some great new dish i like i mean, what type of happiness are you looking for, um <sigh>, well, i mean right now um, my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week, um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though, we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um, you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone, um yesterday, 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal, <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean, you know there's little fun things like that, uh <sigh>, probably um, o_c_d <laughter> and um, she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her, um, i think that she would, say that i have a good heart um we're very different, um, and probably that i'm, i should ask her <laughter> uh, i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun, um but, she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that, why um, i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now, and <sigh>, so i don't really, tell people about them, um, it it's kind of a, it's kind of a killjoy but also, people can feel i feel that people can feel, less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of, um, it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before, even before this difficult time in my life i've been, i've been a private person i don't know why, i think <thi> i think a lot, eh you know i'm a deep thinker, and, maybe it's just, you know, not like i feels like i feel abnormal but, um, maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that, don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure, ten or twenty years ago <sigh>, um, well one thing that i regret right now is um, you know i haven't really found, somebody, you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder, that's it, um i would say <sigh>, that i've perservered, i'm very proud that, even though i have a lot of, difficulties in my life, the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school, and i'm doing it on my own, and um, you know it's, it's kind of a, if people if people knew all the problems that i have, they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um, i really feel that, you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's, thanks, mm k, thanks, bye",12
425,"yes, i'm okay i'm feeling a little tired and uh, worried, um, well i'm looking for a place to live and um i don't have a job right now so, things are <sigh> things are a little, shaky for me, i'm staying with my son in venice, uh it's pretty good but uh both of us need to have our own space so that's why i'm looking for another place to live, originally from new york but i've been in california since the early seventies so, yeah, uh i moved to l_a because i had been living in portland oregon and i was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seemed like a good place to be, um it wasn't too hard i uh i met people right away and um, i just really like it here so it was uh it was easy to connect with people, the weather is <laughter> number one like for most people i love being near the ocean, um, i like the energy i like the um i like the artistic culture, mhm, uh well everybody loves the traffic i mean loves the weather and hates the traffic so i kinda feel <fee> i feel the same way um, sometimes it, it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult, uh no not as much as i'd like if if i had more funds <fu> more income more funds i would travel more, um <sigh> well mostly i've been um, i traveled let's see so my longest uh trip that, was out of the country was to mexico and i traveled, drove down with a friend uh down to oaxaca, and the whole trip we took about mm i think we, took us about four weeks going down and back from uh the bay area, um yeah that was a fun trip, well uh we'd been working together on the census and she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her, um from that trip i would say we were in oaxaca for day of the dead, so it was uh celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in and, everybody in the village makes an altar in their house uh for their, uh loved ones who have passed away, and um, they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that, uh, well i studied <studi> i was in the liberal liberal arts program but i didn't stay <st> i stayed only stayed in school for uh in college for a couple of years, um but i was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities, huh my dream job would be uh personal assisting somebody who, was in a creative field, and getting to uh travel and go to events with them, uh it's hard to break into um i i'm starting now very uh minimally with somebody who i'm doing more of a, volunteer, work with and i'm i'm working on building up some of my skills so that i can be doing more of that, i'm fairly i'm kind of a friendly introvert so um i i'm you know i have no trouble meeting people uh i don't hold back and um, you know just i'm not shy <sh> like shy at parties i'll go up and talk to people, um, but i i am overall kind of introverted so um, i prefer one-on-one, than, big groups, um, i like to watch uh well i <laughter> i like to watch uh improvement shows like on uh h_g_t_v i like to watch um, like remodel shows and and see transformations or or watch movies, or read, oh and and i play some solitaire on my uh my kindle fire, um, i don't usually realize i'm mad until later <laughter> so <laughter> it doesn't really come up um, and i i just tend not to have the kind of life where, um, those situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road, um i get a little annoyed uh i don't get annoyed so much at like when people cut me off or anything like that um, but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or um, you know when they get angry because maybe i've done something inadvertent you know cut them off by mistake and they <the> you know like, they get really angry then that makes me angry in return, hmm <sigh>, um, yeah like i said i don't really get into arguments um, i did have <ha> i was with a friend the other day and um, she got annoyed with me because she felt like i was correcting her, so it wasn't really an argument but she, you know i had said something that, she heard as a correction well it was a correction, and she got angry um but, um, well then i felt criticized and i felt i felt vulnerable, eh i wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable, hmm, um, well i, in that situation, i didn't i didn't have to correct her, um, so <sigh>, i think that's something i'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right, so in general, that's i'm trying to to catch that and, just let people, make mistakes without <laughter> without my telling them about it, mm, hmm, boy i don't know um, gee that's tough, i can't i don't know that i've had that much trouble making decisions um, hmm, well uh <u> uh, was, hard for me to decide, to uh, put my cat to sleep when he was sick, oh it was <wa> and i had to give up a cat um, when i was moving once and, and that was difficult too 'cause, um <sigh>, well in the case of the first cat the one who was sick um, i decided when the vet, said that he thought it was the humane decision, um, and with the cat i had to give up i didn't, i, didn't really decide um i was moving to a place that, where i couldn't take her, and so i, i found somebody who could take her, hmm <sigh>, mm, see, um, gee that's tough, if i don't really eh the the erasing from the memory part um, there's nothing i really wish i could erase from my memory, um, trying to think of something that i've done that i, wish i hadn't done, um, oh okay i remember something there was <wa> <laughter> there was a time when i was, i was in a class at junior college it was a film class, and uh, i was i was the one who was um after we we went out and did a little film project, um, and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week uh i was the one who had the film, and through different, just things that were happening in my life right now i never went back to the school but i never, brought them the film back so all the work they had done, um they had to do over again and i still feel bad about that, eh it's pretty easy um sometimes i wake up, in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often, i've been feeling kind of tired and low level depressed and like not feeling a lot of options, no, yes i have, uh well there were two times there was once um back in like nineteen seventy, two nineteen <ninetee> yeah about nine nineteen seventy two or three and then um, another time um, oh so then when would that've been about sixteen years ago, um, just feeling like there wasn't um, you know feeling that feeling that things weren't gonna change, if i didn't get some help and that if i, i didn't have to you know that maybe if some <s> i got some medication that would help me, um, in the short term, so, i'm not going to therapy right now, uh i was moving around a lot finances i wasn't really feeling the need um i'm starting to think it might be a, an option again, i feel like therapy can be useful yes, well when i went to therapy um, it was helpful to have somebody who listened and, could also, offer impartial suggestions for helping me to, improve the way i was feeling, um <sigh>, well i was on the beach last weekend, uh it was a beautiful day and i was sitting in the sun and uh, just relaxing and i had my notebook and i was doing some writing and, i felt very happy and content, uh i'm kind and compassionate and i'm a good listener, and i'm intelligent and i have uh i have good ideas, um <sigh>, well i wish that uh, sometimes i wish i was <wa> i was a harder worker um i'm not really willing to take, low wage jobs even though, i i need work so i just don't feel like i'm willing to do anything, um, and um, i wish i could act i i said i had good ideas that um i have good ideas and i'm good at the, uh the onset but i'm not really good on the follow-through so, a lot of those ideas get started but then, i don't take them the distance, that's probably the the thing i'd like to change about myself the most, uh ten or twenty years ago i'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree, finish my education, um, and be willing to um, to work, a regular job and to um, to start putting money, away for my, uh retirement, um proud of uh my children and i'm proud of the friendships i have, and i'm proud that um, eh that, people eh people do eh admire me um and value my opinion, goodbye",6
426,"<sync., yes, i'm alright, south l_a, um, the weather, the women, the opportunities, that's about it, racism, police brutality, injustice, that's it, mm no, not much of a exploring type of person, um psychology, mhm, um, it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology, yeah, yes, no, to own my own record label, um, it it's moderately hard but you know, take it one day at a time just, i guess you know, stay focused, a little bit of both, um, i tend to be shy in um, situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to, and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with, yeah, um, turn the lights down low and listen to soft music, mhm, i'm getting better over the years, um, i think i'm, pretty decent now compared to how i used to be, yes ma'am, um, due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions, i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison, yeah, mm, i'm not sure, uh, i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life, um it was probably a few days ago, with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about, her lack of communication, and attentiveness, yeah, uh frustrated, because um, you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect, you know the same effort, by the other person when you're in a relationship, and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so, you know i guess i'm just learning, there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um, probably, the most recent was uh, i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation, with an inmate, when i was incarcerated, and that, made me, that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time, and um, if i handled it differently, i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner, than i originally, happen yeah, mm, there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory, um, probably, uh my first girlfriend, um, she did something really uh extreme, it wasn't necessary in my eyes, and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life, i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory, along with the good memories as well, um, a few you few, fights, uh i guess you could say shoot outs, um getting jumped getting robbed, you know those things i think those inhibit me, i guess to to explore, certain areas of life that i'm not, comfortable with so those are the feww things that, it'd be nice if i could erase it completely, yeah, hurting people that didn't need to be hurt, emotionally especially um, a few women in my life or in my past, um, probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through, along with my close friends and family as well, um used to be rocky, growing up but as i got older and matured, and, the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent, it's it's pretty decent, mm i would say my mother, um, yeah my mother, um, well she she uh she had her share of experiences, negative and positive, um i admire her, the struggles she's been through, um, she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up, but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age, finishing school getting her master's, and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well, and um, probably not the best of family, that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother, mm, it's not easy, so yeah it's not easy, i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues, um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil, but, it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like, it's a negative effect really, yeah, the medication <medi> i don't know shit, i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy, not good at all, um, yeah i mean, i recently got released from prison not too long ago, uh i'm older, now, and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be, i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life, you know, sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just, things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so, yeah, it's all good, yeah so true, yes, <sniffle> about, two and a half three years ago, <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of, not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to, understand myself, how my brain works um, you know so i decided to seek help maybe, to better my life yeah you could say that, yes i am, yes, yes i do actually i do, mm, better decision making, um, better tools to reflect on choices, um how to control, uh, certain situations better yeah, um, <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is, i step back and and and i assess the situation, you know to see what's what's the best way to to react, towards the situation, and by doing that, it has made me more mature, emotionally more mature, and just, has a positive outcome, um, i was lying next to a beautiful woman, who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most, happy, oh my goodness, spontaneous, um, outgoing, sometimes a little crazy, um, fun, that's about it, nothing, um like i said earlier just, you know hurting, the the few women that were in my life my past and, my friends and family that's about it, oh shit, uh school is really important, um, how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with, and what i choose to do in my free time, those are the few things i would tell myself, good music, um, a good game of basketball, um sex, um, i like going out, i like going to parties, um social gatherings, where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like, dancing beautiful women, a couple drinks that's about it, um, i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um, just just, i don't know, just keep going just just, not giving up really, yeah, mhm, bye bye",20
433,"<synch>, yes, i'm doing good, i was born in lynwood, i like all the sightseeing and all the, clothing and stores that they have, well some things all the graffiti um, basically all the wrongdoing, criminal activity and all that bad stuff, i've traveled in the past um, i don't really go out of state, basically, budget money money budget expenses doesn't, limit me to go to another state, i studied automotive technology, and welding, just a passion for cars since i was little, uh, always basically, just wanted to work on cars, pretty, yeah i really love working on cars, my dream job would probably be, probably to own my own, automotive shop or, to own a barber shop, or to just basically be a, probably a master welder, consider myself a little more outgoing, just because i like having fun being uh, just having fun with my friends, being able to do anything i please, basically just smoke on my free time sometimes or, just lay down watch a movie listen to some music, basically hip hop music, or maybe, a good comedy movie, uh fairly easy about it, i don't really, let go get let my bad side get to my emotions, probably earlier today about with my girlfriend, or wife basically about where we gonna go eat, felt desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to go eat, since she wouldn't make up her mind kinda made me, uneasy, probably just to relax and stay calm more than just to outburst and raise my voice, wrongdoings in my past basically anything i could've changed, mm to better myself, basically uh, doing something better at a job that or maybe, uh not doing the job at my greatest, hardest decision would have to be, uh, to plan a family probably, uh just basically, making sure all the situations are where they're supposed to be and, talking it out with my partner, if we're really ready to begin a family, <clears throat>, just basically, the love and bond between me and my wife, um, basically might be like a crash accident, uh basically, pretty horrific, scary experience, when uh i almost crashed into, the freeway barrier, and the car spun out and it basically almost ended up off of a little hill, it was a pretty scary experience as far as, just uh being in a car by myself not being able to control the vehicle, at all and just hoping that i was gonna be okay, it's fairly easy except <exc> if as long as i've had a good dinner, early on in my day fairly would go to sleep pretty good, just restless and just a little more stressed constant things more, would be on my mind, lack of energy maybe, pretty relaxed calm, not really just same old, me day through day just, try to stay happy and relaxed calm just try to stay positive energy, no i have not being diagnosed, no i have not been diagnosed by depression, um earlier today when i had some food, um it's pretty close bonded, it was good, we talk about a lot of necessary stuff try to help each other out at all times, uh my father my sister, my mother, well my father's been there for as long as my mother, has been and she they've both helped me as much as possible from school to, clothing to hmm uh takes me to my sister she's basically, graduated from college so she's like a, a mentor to me kind of look up to her as far as, graduating school and everything try to keep going, mm they're pretty fun, they're outbursting minds basically just smarter, kinda seem, more advanced thinking, compared to what the kids were probably thinking back in the the old age, they learn things a little more quicker, uh no not majorly, just things that i could've thought i could've done, better or, or just a little differently, uh like building my car differently, um, getting, traffic violations, basically just uh, kinda wish i wouldn'ta, sped through intersections or, gotten all those tickets i've received on my record, yeah, i would've basically, just after you realize it the first time try not to do it again, so the same mistake doesn't happen, uh, just my persona kind of as far as uh, whenever i'm angry, just to, find a way to be more easygoing, maybe try to, not be so much of a negative thinker at times when when things get a little harder, <clears throat>, uh, basically when somebody, accuses you of, wrongdoing that probably has hasn't been done, um, basically when a police officer tells you you've done wrong when you clearly know that you have not done, anything wrong, probably earlier this year, basically, a police officer pulled me over for thinking that i was a drunk driver, made me feel really really dumb about myself or tried to accuse me of wrongdoing that i've been drinking and smoking when that was not the cause, i was just very tired that night it was twelve a_m, therefore, i was trying i was i looked probably a little sleepy, just uh, fun cool, easygoing good attitude, um loyal <l> loyal, um, drifting drifting my two forty s_x um spending quality time with my my wife and kids, um, basically, everything i've done for myself from when i graduated high school up to now, thank you, bye",10
438,"<synch>, yes, i'm doing pretty good, i was born and raised right here in los angeles, <sigh> um the weather, um, would be number one i also like the diverse uh, cultures, i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do, and there's a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids, and um i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school, um learn about different people, the traffic the cost of living, um, sometimes i think it's too big, and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or, you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation, i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years, so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere, i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been, and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city, you know things like that, um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year, um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about, three <thr> i think three to four days, and i got to see the capitol, um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house, the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings, and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy, but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes, but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back, um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii, um, actually maui, that was actually two three three years ago three years ago, in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and, i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day, um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins, boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight, they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but, five years apart technically, and they're just super super, typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty, um they're teenage years, um my youngest, um, still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old, so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well, just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how, just with love and nurturing and um, the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with, you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into, you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages, and seeing how they have developed and you know, seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years, and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back, um, mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say, um, for me being a single parent is um the financial, um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing, um, you know the, just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the, uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself, you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice, uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges, um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and, you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with, well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um, i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and, pray a lot and meditate, um, if i see i need a little help if if, you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or, you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just, trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably, um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology, and now i'm studying business <laughter>, i just thought that you know um, there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs, and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better, um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um, with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um, are kinda, become, you know harder to obtain, so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic, and um, you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see, um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately, would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations, um trying different foods out um writing about different people, cultures um, learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the, you know the the people there and um, being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um, it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area, if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that, um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy, and um not so much shy as i am reserved now, um, but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm, checking everything everybody else out, and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people, but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk, um you know, i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can, attach myself to one or two people and, you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person, <laughter>, um, for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging, everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments, meditating, praying or reading a good spiritual scripture, um, if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, um, you know things that will, i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension, um, and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or, i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach, i like <li> also like to just maybe, go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or, maybe go window shopping you know things like that, mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper, as i am i just i'm more impatient, unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations, so i just can become really irritated or irritable, um, quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just, lose patience um outside of that, i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and, be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is, like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be, i do try to be patient and understanding, 'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me, um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone, um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse, so i am conscious of it i try to be, aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and, just lose it, um <sigh>, well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say, because it was not a personal, contact, but a company i eh we, it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the, response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth, very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her, so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know, i just kinda like reached my boiling point, to say the least and was really upset and, eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument, but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two, probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express, um, or actually it was on sunday yeah and um, i know, the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation, and it not be resolved it just takes you there so, um, just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um, and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact, and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised, <clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that, just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know, go back and, pull from those and, you know do my own sense of feedback and, see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and, and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite, <sigh>, mm, well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two, and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um, it just was not a good time, and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time, and um i wasn't comfortable, with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but, he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy, and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about, that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again, i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been, probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um, being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest, thank you, no, mm mm, no, um okay you know um, i was laid off in december, so i've been constantly, trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet, so that's been a little tough i've had i've had to face a lot of challenges, and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school, so i my <m> my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off, you know in the same place, um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating, in next month from u_s_c with her master's in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently, although i've very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me, well, i'm really good with um people i communicate well, i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um, although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person, um, i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so, if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing, um, but probably like interior decorating, anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays, um, i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so, um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening, i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot, and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um, i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has, to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents, um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces, but um i'm i'm, really good with people just you know period, you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well, mm not really, some of the situations um i wish i would've waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children um picked a different partner, um, and i say that i mean my son's father is great but um, a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me we're not together we haven't been together in years but, i'm just saying overall i think um had i, yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and, i think that's, that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do, stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and, stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you, mm, um i think i'm pretty stable and consistent just, with overall i think um how i face adversity how i face <f> i, face things you know um, i am a pretty committed person i try to you know if i say imma do something i try to stick to it i'm a very loyal friend, um and um i'm proud of the fact that i've i've maintained and done a pretty good job with raising my kids solo, okay, great thank you, bye bye",2
439,"<synch>, yes, i'm doing fine, i'm from los angeles and born in los angeles, yes, uh you have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see a lot of things to do, smog, uh the environmental has changed over the years uh , i've been around since nineteen fifty two and, i was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog, and, mm basically that's about it, i've been to several <s> uh several places in the united states yes, uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical i'm a historical buff i, um, just uh going somewhere different than uh where i've been here all my life, uh let me start with uh, well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um, uh i saw um, um, eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um, there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um, god, i can't even think of it right now um, but other than that uh new orleans i've been to new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras it's just i don't like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of, people um i just went on a off season, uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia, and i have taken a cruise, uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise, uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental, um i'm outgoing, as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone, um i don't have a problem meeting people, um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>, oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that, loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid, i've won a lot of sweepstakes and, uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just, eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me, um, getting married and having my children <laughter>, mm, i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not, and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson, and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner, and the other one is a computer engineer, so and i've been married for thirty three years, and um, basically uh marriage pretty strong, you know what, if you build a foundation with your children, and have a good relationship with them, and talk to 'em and find out what's going on, and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you, and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you, you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door, that you care, and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out, um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem, as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble, and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law, uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you, and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son, and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home, on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey, i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads, so it pays off, and i i basically he treats her well, um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um, for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls, so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel, and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they, found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one, and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel, so i've made up for her, and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there, i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly, so i made up for it, i think before i speak, and then i am the type of person also to um, i take on other people's feelings before i um, blurt out the wrong thing i try to, uh analyze the situation first, before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of, um, <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house, uh we had a disagreement on that um, men have their own way of doing things and um, i had told him not to use a certain uh, eh person to work on our house, but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead, and now he sees all the downfalls, and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so, but i guess he can tell by my facial expression, that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money, and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong, and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project, so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um, that i can think of that's recent, i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me, and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um, you need to do your research, i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's, but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money, and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed, he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>, which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money, and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because, it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again, and it didn't make any sense, um, i retired early, um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california, um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen, and i had like thirty one and a half years of service, and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance, so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but, um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long, um, i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay, um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job, because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um, i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up, and i don't i pay very little money, so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive, um, let me see the hardest, it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying, and my mother um, died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma, and, i i putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying, or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me, and i'm like oh my god what do i do , and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order, and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things, you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and, i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff, and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting, she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had, a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything, yeah it was it was but, and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um, since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children, that my husband and i we got together, and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy not insurance policy but um, what do you call the um, barrel insurance we had that, and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything, and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird, so, my son, make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what, i went through, and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on, and um, he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust, i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call, and that's it, i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well, pretty good, um, i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental, um, exercise walk walking more so, no not really, no, no, i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh, uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them, uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um, thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing, oh uh resource person i've been um, described as a resource person from my supervisor, to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about, i just don't dive into any situation i try to look up information uh, some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place, i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map, yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but, sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff, that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things, and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things, and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it, and that gives me satisfaction, uh, i wish i can uh um, stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and, and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem, and if i can stop binging and making food my friend, um, i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um, but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home, and i can't get 'em on right now so, i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh, not happy with my weight that's it yeah, i'm sorry didn't hear you, um, no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on, um, let's see ten or twenty years ago, mm, i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh uh basically um, putting away more money before i retire, instead of retiring too early, most proudest is of my life, um, meeting a lot of people that came in my life, uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school, and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together, lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school, group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion, and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh, it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>, okay, you're welcome, bye bye",1
448,"<sync>, yes, doing pretty good, oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven, and i've been here ever since uh i don't consider myself anything but a, californian <laughter>, uh i'm a welder, um, i just, i don't know something about, it making and um building things and repairing things that, intrigued me and, uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession, <sigh> gee i really never had that i've just, uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh, i was satisfied with that, well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old, and uh, other than my wife i don't have any more family, um he passed away last uh july, and uh i'm, starting to get over it, um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so, i've been depressed about that and uh, uh but i'm doing better, it depends on the atmosphere um, if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm, kinda reserved, but uh, if i'm comfortable, and uh, i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing, <laughter>, <laughter>, right, i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and, i try to pick a movie that's uh, from back then people were different than they, uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it, <sigh> well, my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but, uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper, and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about, but um, i'm working on it and, uh, i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child, oh yes <laughter>, uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh, <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter, but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young, uh follows you for the rest of your life and, i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices, uh me and my wife we, we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree, and it's, she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh, uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is, a determined strong willed woman and <sniff>, i am who i am so, we kinda go back and forth and, lately i have been the one to <sigh>, bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run, it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me, um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed, and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and, having an ego bigger than my common sense and um, that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh, i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um, getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but, when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and, <sniff>, if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so, i, you know ran where, people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble, hardest decision i ever had to make was, giving the authorization to, um, have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed, <sigh> and um, doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him, <sigh> go through any suffering, to, let him slip away, and as you can see i get very upset my uncle, raised me like his own son and, never let me down, <sniff> and he's gone and, for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff>, but as i said i'm getting over it and um, things are getting better slowly, my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself, um <coughs> we enjoy, uh uh doing simple things, it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company, uh we like the same things and uh we, you know occasionally go out and do something together but we, <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she, like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes, mhm, you know, <sigh>, lately, well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do, a rigorous activity or something that, really uh stresses me or strains my body, it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much, i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours, i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but, i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep, i'll stay up all day and, i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but, you know for me i'm, it doesn't affect me, <sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um, uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life, but um <sniff>, i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content, yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um, recently well i can't say recently this was back in january, um, my wife and a few uh friends were, noticing that i was um, becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things, i i didn't see it and um, you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to, but anyway i went to the doctor and um, they gave me the tests, and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh, i've, over the last month or so, nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but, the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me, um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but, um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh, it it could've been due also i was told by him, uh, because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and, so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better, i'm sorry, i'm not understanding you i'm sorry, how <h, no no i have not, yes, two thousand one, um, i was, in a um, uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff>, i was in a um, in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help, um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder, uh worrying and thinking too much about things and, uh thinking the worst and uh, i i take medication for that, uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's, <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor, are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter>, it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so, it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that, um, you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but, you know, it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would, i would do something the medication works for me, <sigh>, last time i felt real happy, well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um, i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff>, when i'm outside of that circle, i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content, i'm not, um, i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so, well um <sniff>, i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff>, well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff>, she would um, describe me as uh, i don't think before i speak, um i um, let the littlest insignificant things, bother me and i get angry over, but the big things it's like, i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um, uh <vocal fry> years and years ago, um, she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender, and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby, and i <sigh>, you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought, <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby, and uh she goes you know you, you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money, you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care, so, that's the only way i can explain it, well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle, um, i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life, and i'm finding it a little bit harder, um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power, to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or, you know not you know movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were, a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a, , uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more, i guess it's we're a little bit older now and, <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh, i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh>, <sigh> uh lately, no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff>, everything's been fine the, like i say the, the biggest, biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever, in a hundred years or ever thought that i would, face that, situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but, they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter>, don't listen to other people, uh, again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh, he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they, um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think, they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems, um, i wish i could've changed some things um, <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody, and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do, uh i don't miss them but, if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made, my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff>, uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat>, uh people that i know say that i'm uh, well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh, restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but, i've been told that, once or twice but i i've kind of, i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but, i just don't feel the motivation no more, i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter>, okay, well thank you, bye bye",18

to, and she lives in northern california and we never talk, because um she uh, she ripped off the family estate, my grandfather <grandf> my grandparents' estate, she, she took all the money and all the stuff and, and left her grandkids and her, and my you know and so uh, her sister and, my, my grandmother's daughter and grandkids and great-grandkids got zero, and it was a few <f> few few million dollars, mhm so we don't talk, i don't talk we don't talk, and it's sad, excuse me can you repeat that, wow positive <posi> my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man, honest uh funny um handsome, um i have a business owner a business man that i worked for who was a extremely positive influence at least in my professional life, um i've had uh, a counselor at u_c_l_a who was um totally i think of her, often, and some of the little things that she'd said to me, keep me going um <sigh> in my life now, trust the process, she told me to trust the process, and when people are having trouble and i'm having trouble i take a step back and say, you know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it's supposed to be, mhm and there's one more, positive influence that i knew in hawaii, that taught me um, a friend of mine that uh lives on kauai that taught me uh, how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and, and i i love her a lot a great positive influence, healthy healthy influence, it's not, i have back problems, so it's hard to sleep at night, uh and i wake up in the middle of the night sort of, uh stretching and, um straightening out my back i have a back issue that sometimes more often than not uh, keeps me from sleeping good, that's okay i'm dealing with it, um i'm a little depressed uh i've been a little depressed i haven't been working as much and um, i um you know i have pain in the mornings and in the evening <eveni> i have pain thorughout the day in my from my with back, and it uh is a little depressing you know i get depressed also um, you know just thinking about, my business that i sold and, you know where i would've been if i hadn't have done that and, a a general feeling of um, i've been a little depressed over the past uh couple of years actually, yes, um well i've been diagnosed many many years ago and i guess depression stays with you although it gets treated, um, and uh i was diagnosed about two years ago, uh i think i don't know it asked me that on the questionnaire as well, and uh and i sought treatment, for it and then uh my insurance ran out, and the prescriptions, uh i couldn't put uh do my prescriptions anymore but now i'm back on uh medication <med> medication and, you know so i take medication for my depression, therapy absolutely, i love therapy, wow that's huge um confidence in self uh, confidence in myself um confidence in my decision-making, a general feeling of, overall content uh, a sounding board, you know when i have stuff that's bothering me that i can't, go to the i i feel that i can't go to the person with, i um, can go to my therapist and, a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or i worked through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation, and in that way i find therapy to be, invaluable actually, i believe so, uh yes i was, i believe it was, i think it was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what i was that's what i was having, and this was within the last, five years i think it was, looking back now, what are we two thousand thirteen it was two thousand nine, so four years ago, not able to deal like shell shocked not able to deal with anything eh irritable on the phone uh i mean just, uh just, anything would get me to fly off the handle and um just uh not able just shell shocked and, not and hiding at my in my house not opening mail <m> mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with, with things that were that i felt were well that were bombarding me i felt overcomed <o> overcomed, and um, the psychiatrist said that it was post-traumatic stress disorder but, um and i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so, uh or so and i don't know through, psychiatry and therapist and medication, um i was able to come out of my shell a little bit, hmm, about a week ago i was on a hike, eh up in malibu and uh at this beautiful labyrinth, that looked over the pacific ocean and we i was with a friend and we were having lunch, and i laid down on the grass, and took a nap, and i felt content i was happy at that moment at that, moment, that time about a week ago, hmm, honest sincere, smart, um, caring, um, <sniffle>, smart, um <sigh>, good question, i'd have to think about that, uh yeah i have regrets in life you know everything works out, so um, you know if i could change the past i would've never dropped out of school, when i did a long time ago i mean i've since gone back and completed lots of stuff, um i probably would've gone into the military, i think i was going to do that in my early twenties, i'm fifty five now, um i sort of regret not doing that, um at that time, um i regret uh, selling my business, i regret, and of course i can't control this but i regret that my father died when i was so young and, he never really got to know me and i never really got to know him, i regret uh, i regret not seeing, my grandmother enough before she'd passed away, i regret uh, i mean those are the things that i can think of right now not putting away for retirement i regret when i had the money to do it, um, yeah, i mean, just here that's what i would say, stick with it, just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through, and, i it when it comes to fear or flight i get the fear and i flight, so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then, everything works out, wow, i'm most proud that i <sigh> have remained, genuine, um i'm most proud of, being who i am, and being basically comfortable with that and i'm proud of that i haven't changed, to the world <wor> to the world you know for the world i haven't changed i've stayed, mm who i am, thank you, thank you,

it's different everywhere the people are different, um it's fun, um okay well the most recent is last year i went to family reunion in new orleans so that was in june, and um while i was there we also visited slidell louisiana for the um, the swamp tours, and vicksburg mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in ferriday lousiana with my aunt who will be a hundred and one, this year in may, um there's a lot um, as far as traveling or just period, uh most memorable experience um well i don't know if it's just one, um probably when, i used to travel with my dad that's where i got a lot of my traveling from, um yeah it was bus car sometimes planes uh mostly what just i guess i'll say mostly down south but it was, really fun, especially the road trips, mhm, um just general and also drama, uh well my dream job is, to become a real estate investor, um well i've sort of really been into it ever since two thousand five um i just don't have the capital right now or the connections that um, since i do like real estate i'm just going to start off as a real estate agent, so i should have my license um sometime this year, outgoing, um well i'm not shy um it could be a little bit of both but um i'm pretty outgoing, um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap <laughter>, um take a bath, um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways, um it needs to be worked on but um, i know when to control it, um when i need to, um, well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but, um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but, um that's usually how it goes <laughter>, um, well, i don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it, so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess, um, probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um, situation i wish i would've handled differently um just, kind of everything in my life almost <laughter> i could've done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it 'cause i don't regret anything that i've done in my life, the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that, mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions, um it was just a lot of um, a lot of stuff through the years um <clears throat> the relationship had kind of deteriorated um, if the relationship, between us was still good, then the things that he were doing um, i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um i've i would feel like well our relationship is good and, it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and, problems financial problems and he's doing this so um, i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but, eh you know he didn't wanna cooperate so, um, well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes, um, something i can erase um, mm i don't think i really need to erase anything um, i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase, um it's fair slash good um there's no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems, um well i would have to say my mother, yes, um well she's just always supported me and, everything that i've done um whether it's, good or not so good so um i think that's a blessing, mhm, um sometimes sometime it's not, um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is as i would like to um sometimes, so um that's more the problem i would like to get, mhm, um just sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap, um i've been feeling fine, mhm, uh no they've been about the same, no, no, um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so <laughter>, um well i guess my best friend would

transportation, and the superficiality, <laughter>, i i don't i would love to travel more, um <sigh>, being able to experience a different way of living, um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and, getting a different perspective, um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months, and i was in bahia which is in the north and um, let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family, um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um, they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting, um, i think taking a bus by myself to, a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go, yeah, right now i'm getting my master's in social work, <laughter>, dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and, how to um, how to intervene effectively with different cultures, and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel, um, basically that those would be the main characteristics, i think that's a false dichotomy, but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone, and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful, <laughter>, um i listen to music, and just lay on my bed and, um, i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things, also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise, pretty good i don't get angry a lot, um, so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that, hmm, um, mm what month is this may, probably two months ago, and i argued, via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but, i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor, um, with a friend i've had for a few years, i felt anxious, um, sad and angry, um, yeah those are the main emotions, i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them, and then i'll notice the physical, uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty, if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me, hmm <laughter>, that i wish i had handled differently, i guess related to this argument um, i went out one night and got, a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up, calling a person for a ride, home but that, really upset that person, and i know that, it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um, it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did, mm, <clears throat>, hardest decision <sigh>, wow um, probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards, well after dropping out i had to really, rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to, dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on, um <sigh>, i think by recognizing what i don't want to do, and doing a lot of research on, program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program, <sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh>, oh <laughter>, um, revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier, it was a dating relationship and, a few years ago we had a falling out, over his treatment of me, and it involved, another person and i wish i could, get that out of my mind, um <laughter>, <laughter>, i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten, um closer to her as an adult, uh we talk pretty regularly, with my dad i grew up with him, mostly he lives in atlanta and, um we don't talk as much but, we are, we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that, contentious or anything, and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family, um so, in general i'm not really that close to family, um, one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five, and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really, opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things, <sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up, because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day, and the thought of it is, you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired, not really feeling refreshed, <clears throat>, i think just <sigh>, self-talk about how what i have to do, isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year, um, trying to think of things that, i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music, and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going, <sigh> feeling <sigh>, uh wow um, feeling, emotionally drained on some ways and, at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown, so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of, feeling accomplished and proud at the same time, no i haven't, yes, in two thousand six, the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um, i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous, and just all those changes going on, really um, exacerbated , things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there, and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed, yes i do, yes, i notice, i'm better able to, accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them, i'm <sigh>, able to think <th>, think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light, and also identify, the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas, <clears throat>, mm <sigh>, um this past weekend, i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again, <laughter> um <sigh>, people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very, um analytical, sensitive intelligent, intellectual, um, i wish that i did not, or wait, i wish, i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on, and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy, <laughter>, start going to therapy now <laughter> um, but yeah i really would and, also, to, what how old am i twenty eight, ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school, i would <sigh> tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future, and to seek out mentors to get a clearer um idea of what i wanted to do as a career, um, i think the fact that i'm in grad school, and, coming from the background that i that i come from, low socio-economic status and, just pushing through, challenges to get here, <laughter>, you're welcome,
