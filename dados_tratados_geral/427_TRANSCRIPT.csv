value
<sync>
yeah sure
i'm good how are you
i'm from florida originally
mhm
where are you from
oh um
for work <laughter>
uh i haven't been back in like a few months
um
i don't know i guess it's like a smaller town than here
it was pretty easy
it's um
it's not that  much of a difference except i guess the buildings are bigger <laughter>
um <tisk> i like the weather
and
uh i like the environment of like
hollywood i guess <laughter>
i hate the transportation <transporta> the transportation system
and the traffic it's really bad <laughter>
mhm
yeah i've traveled a lot around america
um i like like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff
and
uh i guess it's just relaxing and it's fun <laughter>
uh well i went to canada once my
mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there
it's pretty cold <laughter>
i didn't like that
about that particular trip
or
um
i don't know she
made us this uh like canadian food
called i think it's poutine or something and
so i guess that <laughter> that was a  new experience
um
i try to get out in the sun like go to the beach or something
or read a book
um pretty
okay <laughter>
depends on how bad the situation is
um
i don't know like  two days ago
i was arguing with my sister about something
oh yeah <laughter> i really don't remember it something
stupid i think she
i don't know she borrowed something from me and she didn't give it back on time <laughter>
um
i don't know i guess
i mean yeah i wish i just wouldn't lose my temper so quickly
sometimes
but that doesn't happen really often
um
i don't know i guess think more before i talk
then maybe i won't lose my temper <laughter>
um
something i wish i could erase from my memory um
i don't know i guess just
like uh negative people
or something negative people that i've met before
i guess i just wanna erase
the thought of meeting them
um well i
had like friends that were just like
not very good company and
they're just very
not very good influences so
yeah i would just wanna erase meeting them but i'm not friends with them anymore so
um
my
who's a positive influence
my family is a positive influence <laughter>
and my friends now
oh it's pretty good
i
talk to them a lot i see them a lot
so
yeah
mm
the hardest decision i've ever had to make
i don't know <laughter>
i guess um
what i wanted to study in college maybe
it's not that hard but <laughter> it's a little
it's a
big decision
computer science
thanks
yeah a little bit <laughter> not
not as much but a little bit
well i got into it it when <wh> i got into it when i was a teenager so
i guess i just
and i was good at it so i just figured
i'd go on studying it
for higher at a higher level
yeah somewhat but i
uh kinda wanted to
i was kinda trying to make a decision between that and like the arts
so
yeah i'm just happy i did it though
my dream job <laughter>
uh fashion designer <laughter>
yeah
how hard is the job
um
i don't think it's a hard job <laughter> i like clothes and
fabric and
making clothes like that so i don't think it's a hard job actually
i fall asleep like within five minutes
depending on how tired i am
i'm very irritable <laughter> and
uh
yeah i'm very irritable and
not good to be around <laughter> when i'm tired
and i can't focus
i've been feeling good fine
thanks
no
no
no
um
the last time i felt really happy
mm
i guess like
a week or so ago i went to um
i went to
where did i go
i went to this event
downtown
it was like a
art walk thing so it was exciting
thanks
oh it was just like different
art um galleries and stuff downtown
they're just exhibiting their work and
i don't know it was just interesting to walk around and see all that
um
i think i'm
generous
um
patient
i think
i'm a good friend <laughter>
um
i think i'm hard working
and
what else
yeah i
that's that's it i think
um
i wish i was more outgoing
like more sociable person
and
um
what else
i don't know and i wish i was like i guess not um
not easy to um
anger like
get a temper or something
oh no not in trouble it's just
sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people
um getting <get> getting a having a temper
but i've never gotten in trouble or
mm
really badly no
um
i can't <laughter> think of um i guess
i was in
i was in a um <tisk> elevator one time and this person
like was running towards it
and
like like i was trying to hold it for them
but i couldn't reach it in time and they like started cursing me out <laughter> so  like i felt really bad 'cause they  probably thought i didn't try to open it for them
but
yeah
it was that <laughter>
um
anything i regret <clears throat> not really i well yeah i regret um
not
contacting like old friends that i knew
so i guess yeah maybe i'll do that in the future
i know them from like elementary school
yeah but we lost contact through the years
'cause i switched schools
<clears throat>
for now i mean
oh okay um
i don't know i guess i would just say
um
learn as much as i can and
i don't know just
don't hold back so much
with like um
like not being
outgoing and stuff i guess i'd just tell myself to be
more outgoing <laughter>
um
i think they'd say the same thing i said earlier that i'm generous
patient
hard working
and
what else did i say
um
kind <laughter> i hope they'd say that
<sigh>
mm
i am proud of my intelligence
okay
okay bye
take care
