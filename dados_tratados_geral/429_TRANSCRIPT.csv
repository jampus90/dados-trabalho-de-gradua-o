took a long time it was difficult
mm just the uh the stress <st>
getting used to and managing the stress of everyday living
you know
mm
variety there's a lot of variety <vari> there's a lot of variety here i like that
<scoff> the obvious traffic <laughter>
uh internationally no
uh <sigh>
just haven't had
reason to i guess
i have a b_s in math and physics
um <sigh> i went to school later in life and i wanted to actually
know something
so um it was very difficult  very difficult
but i did it
mm
why
um it fascinated me i didn't wanna be intimidated by it
oh yeah
oh yeah
<laughter>
um to be employed writer
extremely difficult
extremely difficult writing
any type of fictional fiction writing's extremely difficult
if i worked then <th> as hard as i do now when i was in school i'd have a p_h_d in math and physics
<sigh> it's so hard
outgoing
it depends on the circumstance
it's it's not a catch-all
depends on the the moment
what do i do to relax
i swim
mhm
swam when last time i swam
um
last friday
yeah mm last friday
what do i do when i am annoyed
mm
swear to myself
pretty good mm
pretty good
takes
takes a lot to get me to express anger
but i do
it was in traffic actually <laughter> so probably two weeks ago
so in traffic
sure um
scrubbed_entry
um just waiting for the light <l> light
and some guy in a pickup is honking at me i'm like
so i honk back
and so he didn't like that
and he pulled up along side me i had have no idea what his problem was
and um we had a little <li> few words
yeah
i mean i i have no idea what i was doing wrong
just waiting for the light
guilty that's a strong word
<sigh>
don't know if i feel guilty as i feel remorseful about actions or words
said and done in the past they come up
oh just past interpersonal <inter> you know interpersonal reactions with friends or family
you know it'll just hit you one day you're not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason and just out of the blue it hits you and i'm like oh
why'd i say that why'd i do that
<deep breath>
mm <sigh> a situation
xxx <sigh>
uh woo drawing a blank
um
for me that question has a negative connotation
so something that's possibly negative in my recent past
um <sigh>
what would i have done differently
i've i don't
i'm pretty in control
of my emotions
and taking the temperature of the moment and responding knowing when to respond and when and knowing not to respond
um
so nothing really springs  to mind that i wish i had done differently recently in my past past yes but not recently
oh
swallowing my pride
putting my tail between my legs
and saying i was wrong to friends
sure
scrubbed_entry
um
scrubbed_entry
i contacted him again and then we're fast friends again
mhm
<sigh>
<sigh>
you know this is again this is past past
so
not recent past
so um
probably
altercations that i've had with my uh mom
you know
things i've said to hurt her
you know
you know when you
hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks
so any time any one of those situations you know
so when i'm i think my emotional i_q has
grown
so i think
in the past past my emotional i_q was very was stuck on infant <laughter>
so
so
i have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families
um my father never had a good relationship
don't know if that will be possible he's still alive but he's in advanced alzheimer's so he's mad at everybody
right now
oh it's fine
you know
it was slow
so
someone oh um
scrubbed_entry
has been positive influence in my life um
my sisters i talk with my sisters
so
extremely easy i sleep well each night about <abo> anywhere from at least eight to ten hours a night
<laughter> yeah
oh lethargic um <sigh>
just going through the motions <laughter> you know
um
it's like this i'll frame it like this david lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he's done some
crazy stuff
as far as movies and t_v's concerned
he said the idea of the angst-driven artist is b_s he says you wanna be creative get a good night's sleep i like that
mhm
good um i can't wait to get up and start the day
oh um
if if that happens it's gradual i'm always thinking about
my behavior and my thought processes and how to
be more productive
in my life
with what
p eh you mean no i don't think so no i haven't be diagnosed <diag> no i haven't been xxx diagnosed with any psychological
acronym <laughter>
no
<deep breath>
uh <sigh> this weekend
had a good good time with friends we had a great mm
was with friends and we just were able to talk about
you know some things and
uh for <fo> conversation lasted for two and a half hour three hours didn't expect it to happen it was good i like talking with smart people
informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare
it's almost like running <ru> uh the high you get after running
or exercising you know the endorphins
it was the same thing
i um
<sigh> either with friends or working on my stuff my writing
or exercising
my heighth
<laughter> i wish i were taller
um
i wish
mm
taller uh physical <phys> just physicality um i wish i didn't wear glasses
mhm
nothing internal
mm
i'm patient i've been commended for my patience
by strangers
um
mm
my relationships with my friends and my family
i understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them
and i take that time and energy
well that's a really open general question of course you know it goes back um are you talking recently are you talking
in the past <pa>
um
i always regret <sigh> things <th>
i regret
this is a little thing it's not a big thing
not being more
productive or efficient in the use of my time each day it's a little thing <laughter>
you know so
i hate wasting time i hate wasting money i hate wasting energy
<deep breath> <sigh>
hm
that's a deep question
<sigh>
i'd say
i was codependant ten or twenty years ago i'd say get some help
get some help
you're co you're co
mm k
sure
