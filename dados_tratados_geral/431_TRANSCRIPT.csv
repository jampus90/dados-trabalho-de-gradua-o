the best thing about being a parent is to see
to see uh uh
a a person that you gave birth to develop into
develop into a wholesome person and
take the values that you taught them and kept the values
that you taught them and
continue to to excel in in their life
the hardest thing about being a parent is um
seeing your child sick or seeing them in a situation where you have no control and you can't do anything about it
it's very difficult then you want to be able to
you want to be able to
be there in every situation or have control of every situation and some things you just can't
like sickness mhm
like i said like if
if one of my children is sick i feel
i do the best that i can but to see them in pain and i feel like i want to
i wish i was able to take that pain whenever they're going through anything i wish i was able to take it instead of them
i think with me i'm more sacrificial than my
mom was to me um more um i think
my demonstration of love is a bit more than she was to me
that i'm most proud of
i'm proud of having a family i guess because it's something that i always wanted in life um to have a family
and i guess i'm most proud of that
