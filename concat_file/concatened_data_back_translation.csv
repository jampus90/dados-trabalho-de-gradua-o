301,"Thank you., mmm k, I'm doing fine, thank you., I'm from los closeles, Oh, great., I live in West los Engels of the West, It's all right., i xxx, No, I live alone., I love being from here, so I grew up here, it's natural., the weather for good the weather, It's always good, it's never bad, there's always something to do, it's rarely a boring moment, Transport, traffic is terribly good likely traffic is terrible in almost every big city, but I hate traffic, not really I mean, I have enough things going on here, so when I travel, it's usually somewhere within the driving distance, I studied uh business, I did it., No, I've been done for a few years, so I haven't gone to school in a while., One day I'll go back to graduate school, but, My dream job would be to just work for me and make a lot of money., I don't know that I don't really have a dream job, just something I can do, I can work under my own conditions and be decently paid and be in a creative creative environment, um, I don't know, I think it's just a question of finding the right situation, so at the moment it was people are a little conservative, what they want, so and how they want it, so it's a little harder than it seems it should be, but I don't know, I think if the situation is right, I don't think it's too difficult, Yes, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,, I work as an assistant to an administrative assistant through a time agency, It's just basically I'm being sent out to do uh, To do desk jobs, Yeah and no, I mean, I feel like I could do more, but you know, it works like this., You know what I mean., I'm pretty close, I mean, they're so, Oh, God, really crazy., Stupid people just do anything to piss me off, um, That's basically <ba> that's the big thing to only irritate stupid people who just do things to provoke me for no reason, What is a good example?, just random people who find it funny just to sit there and get an ascent out of me, but it doesn't have to be one no specific, Situation is just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they think it's just funny to just prod you as it is to poking a stick on an angry dog know that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so, Oh, God, I told you., I don't remember i with these situations that I usually try not to remember <Laughter> when it happens I just let it go and just like the past the past I tend not to look back, What do you mean?, All right., God, what do I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym, Listening to music, I've got a lot of musician friends so I'm just so I'm usually around musician so, something I like, I like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to everything that is art and creative in general., Who was a positive <pos>, I think they're just friends in general who seem to do well and I think they're very inspiring and, That's sometimes a bit tough in a city like Los Angeles, where I think everyone's on their way to reach their own goals so they don't, Sometimes it's hard to find someone who picks up or tries to be inspiring., I don't have anyone in particular, but people raised something here and there., You know exactly how hey instead of doing this, how to do about this or hey you're good at this, why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know, I'm always looking for new ways so they always point out things that maybe I could do differently, instead of just saying negative, hey don't do that that's not, that's why you're doing that it's a waste of time, I guess it depends on who you're talking to., I'm fine that maybe I could work on it., um, I don't know, I mean, I think I can do it better, well back to the point that people provoke me, so I mean, I'm not trying to blow steam and get them under my skin so I usually try not to get it to me, but I don't know, I guess with temperament I think it depends on how I handle my stress, lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation was a little better, no, no, no, um, Nothing big, I mean, maybe when I was younger, I could have traveled more, or I could have worked towards something that paid better job, but I mean,, These are all things I think at every point in life that you always think I should have, but you know,, But then again I think that's for everyone, of course, I mean, I could be a banker or I could be a lawyer or a doctor and about ten times the money I'm making right now, but, But then again I don't like the law and I don't like medicine, so it wasn't meant like that, Yeah, that's good., so, Um, I think, I think my, in my life, I knew that, I have a lot of things I have <ha> there are more dislikes <laughter> than I like, so I kind of cramped it up to what I'm good and what am I not good in and what am I going to work well or who am I good at working and who am I not going to work well with, So I sort of sort out and then the list type of, mmm of the kind of itself answers so, No, I don't think it was hard, but it was just, but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's kind of a good thing because sometimes trying to adapt to things that don't really fit you makes no sense, It's like trying to push a round pole into a square a square hole and it's like it just doesn't matter how you try to push it in, it won't go in, so sometimes it's just so good to go down a path that seems to work better for you., unforgettable experiences around hmm, I think it's just, I don't really like everyone in particular, I think every day is almost like an unforgettable experience, whether it's positive or negative, I think it's just everything if it's just the fact that, I have a job and I can take care of myself is almost like an unforgettable experience maybe for the average person it sounds stupid, but you know, I think just the fact that I'm able to, I am able to get as far in life without how completely self-destruct is already an achievement, so I feel like, I've come somewhere., Maybe not to get to the point of the average person they like to think how good, why aren't you a millionaire, but you know what not everyone can be a millionaire, Yeah, that's good., um, when was the last time I felt really happy, um, I don't know that I'm not really someone who likes, I don't have really high or low lows, I mean, I haven't reached lows, so I mean,, I don't know that I'm usually pretty, I feel like a level person and I'm pretty happy <ha> every day I feel like I'm reaching a thing then I'm pretty happy so, I guess to answer the question probably, Mmm probably yesterday I just feel like when I'm able to achieve something then, hey I'm happy, I don't know, I don't really have a best friend, but I mean well to answer the question in general friends, I think they'd say that I'm pretty much out, I'm pretty, Determined, I'm trying to you know I'm trying to you know that I'm trying to interact as much as possible I'm always outside of networking as much as possible, so, I don't know, I guess that's basically what I think they'd describe me as, All right., No problem, All right., See you.",3

303,"Okay, how about you?, here in California, Yeah, that's good., Oh, well, it's big and wide, there's a lot to do..., In order to provide employment opportunities as other countries, So pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here, Traffic around perhaps the violence rate bad news, although you know that you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still need to watch it so you know, look out what's going on on on a daily basis, Sociology I have a two-year degree in liberal art, but my main subject was sociology., No, I'm actually a m_t_a bus operator, Now that subway is constantly growing around my dream job is to move into the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervision next week so 'because they're looking to promote within the company so that the good thing is there are a lot of possibilities in the metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition fees and things of this nature, Thank you., Well, it's not really hard as right now it's easy if you use it now because they look to promote within so that you know so that I'm already working there, that's a good thing, so it's good to go ahead and take the classes you need that you're interested in and go on and the ladder as soon as possible, What do you mean, I'm sorry?, All right., Read a long walk hot bath meditating just close my eyes sometimes, I'm pretty good because see that I run a bus operator you in situations and situations you need to stay calm and still professional at the same time, Well, I look at it as if it were going with me I mean it comes with experience you know about you doing something on a continuous basis usually you'll get some somewhere down in the line you know well so I see it so that I've been driving and dealing with the public for years so it's like you might know the people treat how you want to be treated, No, I'm pretty good at it now., Maybe when I was younger, you know yourself when you get older, you get smarter, you learn different things, and I'm still learning today., I'd say my family you know, my kids you know, even though you know I've had a lot of deaths around me, but that's just part of the life experience you know, you were born here, but you have to go here one day, but, my children will hold me, you know, healthy and you know, I love them and my family, Thank you., No <Laughter>, to give good examples that you know because you're the first teacher you know and want to be a positive good example for your children, and I think that's a good thing and it starts at home, Well, um..., If you're the first teacher your kids are you see them on a daily basis when they wake up, so whatever was taught in the apartment they're looking for 'and learn every day you know if there is a home school you know people children have a tendency to do things they see you know what I mean so that you try to keep it positive 'em good morals and values and how to deal with other people regardless of race and you know different things of this nature, I have a son four and a half years old I have a daughter seven years old and I also have a twenty-three year old, Yes, I'm ready to be, Well, my daughter's pregnant with a boy, she's got three around little girls, so I have three grandchildren and one on my way this time, which is a boy., Yes, thank you very much., The most difficult thing is:, Now at the moment, I'm a single parent, so it makes itself difficult, you know, and, they can be expensive in times you know it depends on the situation of the person you know whether they have help or a job you know things of this nature to help the situation better, but it's hard to you know, but you I try to you know you can keep a job food in the house you know just care and support my kids the best way I can, with my children or just time, What's unforgettable to me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree, so it's kind of like yeah, it's kind of, though I know the baby of ten kids you've got, And I've always kept this in mind, although everyone's pretty much got a decent job for my whole family, but I'm the only one with a degree, so I kind of knocked on my back, as you know., You know that I'm just what I remember graduating you and my family there and supporting me., Thank you., I'm glad I've achieved something you know, even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had, um, I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident, I never went back, I got distracted and you know that I was working at the same time, but I was just like more than I needed income than to teach at that time because I was a young parent you know because I had my daughter around seventeen, so I was like I needed the money to support her, but I never went back, but I did., I feel like I'm taking a few classes now that I'm on the subway to help me pull up the ladder, so I'm starting a class next week., Thank you., hm, The advice I would have given myself, that I would probably not have been a young mother at a young age and that, I probably would have done it., stay in school you don't know that the accident only distracts me and not I would have stayed in school I probably didn't have children early you know about, I would probably have stayed at school and probably had a part-time job or something just I feel like, Education is an excellent thing for a person who only knows and learn different things keep your mind open for learning new ideas every day, So I think this is a plus that you know in one's shoes just to be better, that they know each other through education, maybe to promote in your company or whatever the case may be, that they help you improve your career, I'm not quite sure., You learn from your mistakes you know, but at the same time you don't keep doing the same things I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change yourself, you know like me, even though I'm going to school late, but still I'll let you know that I want to make myself better., Yes, My oldest daughter, We had a fight because, only, the life she is living and the things she is going through, and I had told her that she just had to make some changes to improve her situation, And we fought because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it., hear the stuff you say, even if it's true, or, Or they just know that they just don't want to hear it, that they might be going through something they don't want to hear, but we were arguing about it, but..., that just happened, you know,, I just told her it wasn't me., I'm sorry., very close, very close it's just that the situation is my daughter in her just needs to make some changes to improve her life, And I'll say,, She's..., She's kind of stubborn in her way, as you know, that I was raised to listen to your mother, you know, your mother won't tell you anything wrong, and I've told her over the years that you know different things, and it's kind of like I've been talking to a wall because she's done the opposite., And now she's sorry that you know because she's like my mother told me that you know Mom that I'm doing the opposite, so I guess she's gonna have to bump her head a few times to get it, it's kind of like I told you I left it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change., It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she doesn't hear me and I'm like it's gonna take forever to change, but it's up to the individual whenever they're ready, you know what I mean, if the person gets tired of something that makes them change it, it can't be if you want to do it, but, The ball is her yard you know., I can only do so much, Oh wow, I've had my days around, Since I'm two little ones around me kind of like trained them to go to bed at eight o'clock because you know they have to go to school and I think it's important to have a good night's sleep because it kind of like, It's like being ready for the next day, or you know how you feel when you rest, what kind of person you're going to be on the day you know, because everyone has their days, whether it's good or bad, but that's just a part of life, and I feel like when you've had a good night's sleep, I hope you'll have a good day you know, Pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving the bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job yourself when very stressful, so I feel when I'm rested it will help me, what am I so tired of lazy, you know, Feel like I want to lie down probably going to sleep <Laughter> the rest I need, but <Laughter>, I never thought of that., All I know is that you know., Because like I said, you know everyone has their moments that I've never thought of., hm, no, no, I don't really have a best friend, but a person I've been dealing with and who I've been working with, she'd probably tell you that I've bypassed a Go better a lot., Reliable responsible, I'm a man-to-man person, I get along with others you know, I'm kind of like, um, I leave a good one a good sign, whether I know you or not, if you know how, Like you and I now, you know that I..., You'd probably say, oh, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know, something like that, Thank you., All right., I'm trying to stay happy I'd rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going You know what I mean, especially when I go to pick her up from school or her being hey mom you know that just somehow make my day, only they run to me you know it and are happy and excited you know what I mean, Thank you., you are more than welcome you have a good day, Goodbye.",0
304,"I'm doing good., from los engeles california, around the cool weather the beaches the people the schools, Development of children, Yes, To be a teacher of special education, It's not hard because I love working with children., Yes, dishonesty, perhaps, um, like when a guy like especially when it comes to relationships, when they lie to you about something that's very minimal, my mom I want to say my mom, to very close we talk every day, very close, although I don't live with them, I try to see them as much as I can, It's okay <Laughter>, It's good., It's, Yes, I do., They're friendly, it's just that they're very quiet., Because I didn't get used to this environment., it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap, so that's good and they're friendly, so it's okay, I wish it would have been a little better, so yeah, Yes <Laughter>, I had another way to live with someone else., and I'm still friends with the woman and I come to find out that we're connecting more than the roommates I live with, so I'm sorry to move in with the roommates I have now, against whom I should have moved in the beginning, so, but I'm stuck for a year, so it's whatever it is, That's all right., How do I know who, i, Yes <Laughter>, There's nothing that really makes me angry that I can think of at the top of my head, um, um, Maybe when it comes to schools, how they might treat the children especially colored, that makes me really angry, mm yes, Because I do things from within I think so to do things internally motivated I guess yes, Yeah, that's good., Wow, I hardly argue with anyone <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., Oh my sister, I guess my sister who was about a month ago, Uh I felt very cheated and insulted because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespectful to me in any way because I'm an adult, so yeah I didn't feel the situation at all, um, only that she interferes in the business of adult people and, it was a conversation between me and my mother and I guess she heard what was being said, and she felt like through my actions that I chose someone else about my family if that wasn't even the case, but because she didn't know the whole situation that she just automatically accepted and put stuff on Facebook about me disrespectfully calling me by name and it was just so <Laughter>, and she then comes to me about it as she did all these other things on Facebook I don't, that's one thing I don't like is if you hate I have indirect comments like if you have to talk to me directly to me don't put it on Facebook tell other people, This is a pet peeve of mine, so I really don't like it., Yeah, well, I mean, we're fine now., So that's good., Yeah, that's good., not, People so easy to believe, so gullible, not so gullible, I guess I've heard that lately, as I think, someone is saying something that someone is saying without really thinking about it or without them proving it, so I think you could say I had a lot of mistakes I don't want to say I regretted it because I'm glad I went through it while I was younger than I was getting older and going through the same situations so around, Yes, I think people are too easy and I give people too many chances, so, Yeah, that's good., when I went on a cruise that was a happy experience when I went on a cruise with my family to Mexico when I was sixteen, about six years ago, Yes <Laughter>, Yes, I mean yes, I guess it was <Laughter>, No, I really want it., um, try to see new things new views of the world around trying to see the different types of food around how the government is and how

happy now., mhm, no, no, no, very friendly and funny, Talkative, To get through high school, we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week I'll try to see them at least every few months, They are everywhere <Laughter> around yeah, No comment on this, They're smarter, they learn more than we learned in the day they learn, they're very advanced, but when it comes to technology, they're not out, they're always on the computer on their phones, they don't play outside anymore, they don't care about nature or the little things in life, they just do, but when it comes to their mentality, they argue smarter, because the schools get better, I won't lie that way., when what happened, I was just..., All right., Last weekend I guess, Right now., um , What did I do?, Being with my boyfriend makes me really happy, so I just hung out with him last weekend and I can never see him that much, yeah, Because he works I have school different schedules, It's not that bad

uh, All right., I got a D_u_i last year and lost my job, I'm a truck driver by trade so, Such a way, threw me far away uh with a fourteen hundred dollars a week job uh and then go to nothing like plus losing my license somehow threw me away really, and I couldn't get around, I didn't really uh, I found everything I was interested in, so I started cooking., and we try to see which other route I can go as far as uh a kind of career and uh, so, I decide to go to the culinary field, but, you know, I still have to work, it's hard to find work with uh without going to school., and uh so, But I think I applied to Ralphs today, so I hope I get the job I should actually have, so..., um, but I'm starting to see a light, as I said at the end of the tunnel, now a little bit gradually, my dream job would probably be a forest service, out in the wilderness yeah, I like being alone, Excuse me., All right., You know, I have a lot for animals I'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and I like it, I don't like people too much, Uh so being out and uh I've always enjoyed being out, that's how I'm a truck driver I've traveled the world, I don't like being in a warehouse or an office., outdoor kind of guy so, one of my trips would be uh, I spent a year and a half in Japan and uh on the lower island uh there that they built this bridge, uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh, I was there to work., uh for a very white oh uh a very white tiger act and uh working for a Japanese circus, So it was interesting that many people on this island didn't really see many Americans, because that was also one of the islands we bombed., So there was a lot of negativity, but I've got quite a good idea, you know, outlook uh on life uh especially during the times you know i, I enjoyed it that you know., through all the travel and meeting new people and to eat you know different around different foods and uh it was a good experience for me, all the experience was pretty good for me

People tend to drive me almost over, so if I don't pay attention to the traffic all the time, uh you know I find myself sometimes, You know you have to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of having the right to go or something like that., Yeah big time, What do I do if I'm angry?, um, I'm probably sitting there, sitting there, airing, you know, I speak my opinion, even if I'm often myself, you know exactly how you know assholes or whatever you are., Now you know, I carry stones in my back pocket, so I can know it's happening so much where I'm just I'm just surprised about what people do sometimes you know that you almost know about everything you know, I'll probably almost run over probably on a daily basis, And if I don't watch, I'd be in the shit stream., It's hard to deal with people who are particularly trying not to respond because there are consequences for your reactions., It was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest., I'm pretty honest with, I am open and honest about everything and everything, and uh, what it was about uh just she lied to me to uh told me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something and that and this aspect and I come to find out a week later that it was a total lie, so I just, You know that didn't like it at all., Excuse me., um, I'm trying to miss the word for it., just that I don't know now if I could believe everything she's saying now, so it was uh, I felt hurt you know, uh, you know that here we're in a relationship for a little and good, that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is being honest, um, I don't like that I said I'm not holding back and I'm pretty honest in everything and everything I do or say so, you know and if you lie about something good, You always have to cover up., more lies with the lies you've already told and I just, You don't see anyone you know, so somehow it took a lot of me to trust her now, or you know whatever I am, you know, it's true it's not you know, so it's somehow hurt our relationship, There's nothing I can do about it., Uh fun i, how to go to the beach uh, I love shooting darts, but I haven't done it in a while I love to paint uh I get in watercolor painting, and I'm pretty gifted about it and around, uh i want to try some other media and uh let's see here i love fishing, I haven't been gone in a long time., and uh, I like driving a truck, you know, it's my job, you know, I was a really enjoyed it I don't like driving through cities, but uh usually when I'm in the middle of the night where I can see all the stars I like stars I'll see if I'm looking around, Pick some of them., Astronomy uh stars up there and around, I'm a pretty easy guy to go, so shoot pool around, Sunshine only, which I like, Uh most memorable experiences around, Good or bad, uh, the most memorable experiences, Probably., Play with lions and tigers uh, To wrestle a baby elephant in a mud puddle, uh, I'm just enjoying myself., I know, not, I don't have much family as it is, uh, At least here in the States, I'm not from Central America., But I'm not close to I've got uh, three brothers a sister, and I'm probably not really close to any of my siblings, I'm talking to a brother, Uh, a little..., my other youngest brother you know he just I would rather not know that I'm talking to him, but it's you know, only I'm trying to keep it on a professional basis my sister I'm not talking to at all my other brother among me, I haven't spoken to him in years, so I'm just near my mother, uh, my niece., a few of my nephews and that's it., I've done everything I can to avoid it, um, to avoid them, Uh yeah, I just don't talk to them I don't call them I don't ask for them I know, I'm talking to my mother pretty bit of my brother a little bit, but I just don't mention these topics or when they're being raised I usually say that you know it's on them and I really don't want to deal with them so, It's been hard lately, it was probably hard for the last uh, goes to one year, You know that I..., depends on my thinking process at the time I said I was looking for work., So just..., wonder why you know I'm not gonna be called I just mean I have racing thoughts, so , or I'm getting depressed you know because I or I'm worried about things you know that really I don't control, so, I don't know., lately I just slept a little too much uh at least for me because I'm so used to sleeping only four to five hours per night, but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and I'm still tired, lately I've probably spent the last few months, um, tired <Laughter>, I know., Sometimes when I don't sleep well, I just stay with the same things that bothered me so you know that I'm more of a guy you know, I love working., um, and if I'm not, it's just a little too much time for me to spend in my own head, And so, You know., i there i either when I'm busy or i do what i know you're in what job i kind of know you get it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me, and uh, So I can remember that you're either working or thinking at home and then thinking about knowing that I don't have to worry., You know about money, You know, bills are paid and I can just focus on other things, either you know, do the things I like, or, Maybe spend a little more time with my girlfriend or something like that, How do I do something?, How can I deal with them?, um, I just..., Don't try to think about it, it's not about whether you can handle it or not., I just do it's uh, I'm more of a guy who just, You know, it may take a moment for, to the, saying that I'm done with something, but you know, it's when I don't have control over it, there's nothing I can really do, the only thing I can do is control what I do and that's actively looking for work to go active on uh interviews, I'm talking to others about work so I can somehow know that I'm going back to..., back to the basics You know that I just don't allow a lot of things to bother me, it bothers me but I'm not trying to keep it bothering me, when what got me in trouble, my mood swings I mean, um, Yes money I mean you know my past I have a past so uh the kind of tends to uh, I don't know if I'm hired, so I have to deal with different employers who, uh say uh crime friendly and uh uh stuff like that and I'm trying to tell you I've been teaching on uh, on uh how to interview, how to uh, how to answer some of the questions you know, come pretty a little and uh, I'm kind of thinking about it, but I have to keep pretending that this isn't the one that, who I want to be more like this or you know, I've done, uh, I did it., I have done my time so to say, but I took the time you know the last time I took only a lot of time and, and try to uh work on, the problems that have bothered me so much, You know what's positive, I've been thinking about my g_e_d differences many classes around uh uh going to school, I didn't go to school., and uh, anything that would somehow change my old ways and uh and try to move on to more productive activities, Excuse me., I still haven't heard you., the, the people are deceptive, Can you repeat that once again, All right., I was diagnosed with bipolarism., um, It's hard if you don't know., I'm not medication, so I mean, I used to take medication, but, um..., again I try to live from life uh I try to live life according to the conditions of life and I just know,, I know that the medical institutions always want to label something and, And what I don't like about it is that they're just experimenting with pills, you know, I was probably on every imaginable pill there is and around, you know, some of them were too strong or some of them were not strong enough and, So I just try to deal with things uh, It's just my life skills you know I don't want I don't want to work with drugs I know certain drugs work for as three to four months six months and then they go well here I'll try you on this and or I'll try you on that and it's just an ongoing process and I'll probably go for about the last two years, For about three years, I said that you know what that is, and..., whether it's different than if I'd be on top drugs for it, I don't think so you know it's still the same stuff that I'm still getting the same problems and I'm still, uh get the same fear as if I was on medication for it or not so I just, and I'll deal with it you know, sometimes it's not good, you know that I get very irritated with people I don't like people, I don't like crowds, I don't know how disgusting people like huge empty rest, um, But I'm getting a person you know it's not that personality, but I think people can see me and just say that you're not messing with this guy or you know..., but still you know, I like driving public transport quite a bit and around, You know you have a lot of disgusting people on it, sometimes I have to get off the bus., That's how I deal with people because I know there are consequences if I didn't deal with them like that., So I just let it go., I'd rather take the time to leave the bus and wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad, had a problem before I quit, uh, I don't know if I knew I had a problem before I found out I knew other people., um, I have a lot of ups and downs, so I know a lot in my younger days people would tell me that you know when I told them that I was diagnosed with you know bipolar that around, Many remarks were like oh, that's what's wrong, you know that was what was wrong with you, we want you to have found that years ago, I don't think the drugs really work, but what I do, I think, um, um, um, um, as you know, just getting older., Type of uh, You know it works, you know it, I'm so in contact with life, Excuse me., Uh I talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while, Um, recently, And it helps a lot what you know just to erase my anger, uh my thoughts..., many people may not understand, but uh, a therapist is, I think the bigger thing is that I can just figure it out, whatever it is for me, whether it's uh., People you know uh, uh, other problems you know were whatever may be the case, I just think to talk about it and they are so good listeners and can somehow like, You know they're giving me the same advice you know I'm giving myself or whatever I'm giving to others., But it's always helpful to hear it from someone else who, will be a you know you know they're going to school for this, so you know, but it's good to have, Yeah, that's good., Well, I'm not going around like that anymore, I kind of miss that you know how I said uh, uh, I really miss it, but uh, It's just one of those things that you know I'm just acting so you know, uh after you know if I'll ever get a chance to go back to therapy I'll probably, To good monetary reasons and uh, You know, I don't have health insurance, there's a lot of things you want to know, but I can't tell you,, You know, money situation isn't so great right now so, how my friends describe me, um, they would probably describe me as uh, uh energetic uh outgoing person uh as soon as I get to know people, um, I laugh you know I laugh I laugh a lot, um, But..., they would probably tell you that I'm also very serious and uh, uh, hidden person I don't reveal much you know,, and uh so, Someone who had a positive influence in my life, Someone who..., Someone who had a positive influence in my life, Uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when I started with uh, with exotic animals he really was, you know, he was uh, Uh german and um, they have not been taking place, I don't know what he saw in me, but, He taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and..., showed a lot of trust in me and that in it also built trust in me, and uh, Let me know that you know there's nothing I really can't achieve when I imagine it., you know, Yeah, that's it., You're welcome., to <Laughter>",7
306,"Beautiful, Uh colorado, mhm, Career, Career opportunities, uh unlawful, uh for training for the weather, for a friend, not often at all now, every few years, Oh the weather uh the beach sunsets on the beach, uh the thought of uh career opportunities, um, an educated group of people demanding market, it's an adaptation uh to come here many people misjudge it a little it's a relaxed appearing city, but it's actually very much to know uh sensitive to you, Uh success and commercialization and this kind of thing, So you have to keep the pace, this is a bit more difficult, I think if you make the adjustment first, and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market where you just have to work hard as you do it in others, Oh, be a lawyer., mhm, oh just because you have the power you can use oh you know skills to be able to affect people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being an assistant in this area, oh uh a lot of it is no longer around just brothers and sisters from the state so not particularly close now, Dishonesty, Lack of sympathy, Uh insensitivity you know, Very good., when I'm something, regressively so [Laughter], mhm, Oh wow uh, oh just a friend a friend who's just a, has a fabulous job is uh spend too much money he needs to save, uh by means of a work situation only one work connection, Together friends mhm, ah close close now we spend time we got uh we go and have fun sometimes, uh walk walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach area is a kind of fun rodeo ride occasionally, and uh and watch movies, Art galleries, Oh uh my daughter, I only have one daughter who graduated from u_c_l_a law school and uh I raised her all alone without any help, so it seemed like an achievement that was worth the two jobs and the work was, I think it's difficult, I think it's a difficult job that requires a lot more work than most people give him credit for if you want to do it right, you know, it's always second guess of your behavior and this kind of thing, I'd say group pressure., it can change everything a parent has tried to put in a child that is good, Scrubbed_entry, So this was a really bad time for us, To I think it depends on which neighborhood or state you are in, or the uh, I think they are a little misguided I think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired at the moment, I think they're burdened by the worries of the wars and so on, and I think they can probably get a, Uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as opposition to only more separate group than a family [fam] once they were I think, You know how uninspired at the moment, I worry sometimes because you know problems with work, but it's pretty easy., No, I don't feel like I'm not sleeping, I just know you know I'm gonna worry about something at work occasionally., Oh, God, a few weeks ago., oh just uh you know, unfortunately we need to worry you know that I'm lucky, that's not easier it's just the collaboration between people uh it solves most of everything you know so you always want that around you, only stressed, Yeah emphasizes more, mhm, To yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not how you feel or misjudge things that you might judge differently if you were better rested, Uh not depression, um probably yeah I was that as a possibility I had an employment lawsuit a few years ago and uh actually sued it and won the settlement around something about whistleblower-thing implications [in] implications of that and around and I was somehow bothered about it and so I found when I came out of it I couldn't immediately find work in my own area, so I had to go back to u_c_l_a and a new uh professional direction and, I sometimes felt scared that it would happen again, you know, and you think that would never happen again, you know., To just that I noticed that I noticed that I felt very uh in my legal class, I had a section on labor law, and there was a very complicated file that I had done with a lot of work and study for my case, but once faced with it again in this class setting I just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and I realized that I was traumatized by having to go through that again to know that yeah post-traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down, from what I understand and so I think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that I had to get the paper back and wow you know no adrenaline just wow, there is a xxxx, back back, just uh just extreme uh you know, avoiding something to do, that should have been easy for me, and uh and think about it as thoroughly as I should have studied it or deport it uh the feeling of going through the paper, this kind of paper, even if there was only one class assignment again, you know, Well, not lately, you know for sure when what happened about ten years ago, now it was decided in court about seven years ago., and yes, it was effective, you know, it was effective in the way you see most everything and in your trust and this kind of thing, I'm sorry I repeated the question., I feel peaceful, yes, I was peaceful that it is, but angry that it has ever happened., So it's hard, I'll probably never feel peaceful about this topic ever it always, the mention of it always makes me angry that I had to go through the yeah, I don't think I've tried anything to avoid it., I think that was also an aggravation for me because I'm a patient person, realistic and around and I tried everything to avoid confrontations in the matter, but it was only necessary to try, you know, help me cover the damage to my daughter's life, I don't now maybe once in my life not now you, if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you overcome the perceptions of people or their judgments of you if you can, effectively explain something and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself, that others usually have judgments about age or something like that, um, well just raise a daughter you know or uh, They know only to the experience of thinking that this was one after all the years that was a success was their graduation from the legal school, Yeah, that's good., I'm just..., like a lot of work had a good end, Uh you know happy that it fulfilled wishes or dreams for this child have been fulfilled, You know that and she was able to make this success, Wow for [Laughter], I tend to be happy with life, because the alternative will do harm, that you know your ability is successful., So I'm trying to force luck I think in most situation in my life route I find something about it, uh, when I lost some weight recently that made me really happy, I travel a little locally I traveled more than I was younger I really enjoyed, but only too busy in recent years, Only new places to take the ability to take care of the worries we have every day work, or worry and somehow see them away for a while and something new, You know the way, I go back to uh colorado san riosco went through Vale and uh and spent the night there and around and it was only in spring when there were not many skiers and it was just nice and very quiet, many restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was nice, Yeah, that's good., Wow uh, only, I work hard loyally., To be creative, To just see something you're creating, you're trying to create, something you hoped the picture would know if that was the case., You know, just hard work uh just met or presented yourself in a certain way that you know that it makes you happy, to my daughter around very [ver] pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she sends me pictures all the time, All right., See you.",0
307,"< slaughter>, Um, musk, My family moved to the U_s and then I moved down here for college, uh it took me a long time to live here for about a year since I graduated, so there was a lot of ups and downs, but finally it was adapted so it took a while, though, It starts and I have two roommates and there's always a bit of drama here and there between, the girls but for the most part after a year and a few months I think we finally learned how to live together, but it was pretty like a reality t_v show for a while, One from college and the other from Craigslist., It varies depending on whether we're mad at each other so much, I guess pretty close, Right now, we're a little distant., Oh over the distance, Okay, we haven't seen each other yet, we haven't met in two weeks., Because one of them got into this car accident and so she's been distant since then and somehow locked up in her room, and the other one always works late, so we just got our schedule out and no one really tried to hang out with someone, so it's kind of, We're just waiting for someone to take the first step., It's okay, it's getting better., it depends on with whom, I'm, Dealing with I think I'd say with some people I don't think with my family very good my friend it's not very good, but with other people I may not know so well, then I am able to control it a little more, but it becomes more passively aggressive than as full of anger, Oh, 'cause I don't want them to see me as a bitch., Yeah, that's good., Uh probably my best friend nicole, She's probably been best friends for like, God since high school newcomer year is the high school when we first got to know so yeah, um, of, of what, my friend nicole, around we met in French grade beginner year of high school, we were in the same class and then we kind of started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we kind of started hanging out and then we just got closer and since then we've been really close, mhm, um, uh go out with friends go out in bars go dancing cycling hiking, Stay active to go to the movies go to eat in restaurants uh photography, um, just hanging out with friends, I guess, Whatever, uh, It varies as if I'm really close to them when it comes to things like school work., such types of, Things, but when it comes to relationships and friendships and personal things, I'm not really talking to them., So I guess superficially close, But I rely very much on her, so we're close., mhm, That's a good question, I guess it depends on who it is again., I guess people who're ruthless are careless Flakey ignorant, and, uh, Imagined, yeah, I guess that kind of people, and when people just..., What makes me angry, that's a good question, I guess a lot of things drive me crazy [Laughter], but it's mostly how people react to different situations can make me angry, I think, Yesterday, and it was my friend and we argued because he tried to be healthy and save training and money, And so and so, So by doing what he does, he's ordered pizza in so he doesn't save money and he's not healthy, And so I was frustrated with him because I'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and every time he's like I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it so he constantly breaks promises that another thing makes me angry are people who don't follow through, about other people or about me or angry, xxxx [Laughter], um, angry I think I'm going with the no I don't feel angry often, Get the fuck out of here., that's a tough way to just be paid to be me, I don't know what I'm trying to find out because I quit my full-time job because I hated it, that it was usually sitting in an office all day, which I thought was extremely boring., So now I'm working in a restaurant job and I'm trying to look for a second job to support myself., My dream job, I don't know what it would be, but I know it would involve people and I would like to have a kind of finished product or some kind of performance towards the end, I guess it's something I've realized, I like to see it, the result from all my hard work because I loved in sociology and as much as I did that Major is clear to you, it's a whole lot of theorization and argument, but without any real solution, so it's just like in the end all you have is these theoretical elements that you can't really do with and show nothing for your work, except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so, something to do with people and maybe something artistic I love photography, I love cooking baking in particular so I don't know anything, in this, Rich I think, I've been traveling a lot my family is known for trips we've gone to, gosh seven eight different countries I have lived in three or four different countries, I haven't traveled much lately just because I don't tie any money and jobs somehow, but I'd like that, I guess my dream job would be a photographer who would be fantastic for national geographic,, To or a huge photographer who travels, that would be great, but anyway, yes, I travel a lot, in the new places new faces new experiences I become restless very easy, so it is nice to be constantly in motion and, see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just don't get stuck in the same routine I hate the routine and worldliness of everyday life so it's beautiful,, stir up things, Oh, God, it's all right., I'm trying to think, one of my travels, I think we can talk about it, I don't know it's funny, although I've been one of my most memorable trips in many different countries, one of the trips I made with my family, I was a three-week road trip with my family, there are five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon., I know unnecessary to say it's as if you were so close for three weeks camping you always start on the nerves of others, but it was really fun and like when I traveled so many places, I realized that it was like such a beauty in the American landscape and so we were around the southwest and the big canyon to zion to the great tetons to yellow stone and it was absolutely amazing to see that all the natural beauty so, um, and we saw a Grizzly bear black bear many bison a wolf and it was really cool these kinds of I don't know natural wonders also really surprise me because these things are not man made, and as pretentious as it sounds after a while, Europe is somehow not getting old, but it's as if you know that you have the same idea as, white old white men build large buildings and artwork and it's beautiful and everything, but as you just kind of like okay I want to see something that is natural and beautiful, or something that's different, Cool, um, quite simple, as long as I, Getting healthy no I always sleep so easy, oh grumpy and only very lethargic and little energy say not much and just somehow away in my own world, I don't usually get enough sleep anymore and I've trained more, so it's kind of, Excite me, so it's not that bad., That's good., I guess I was more negative right now, but it has to do with such circumstances as uh it's been about five months since I quit my full-time job, nothing else has found that really found nothing else I'm interested in, so, It's more like ugh, what I'm doing there., Yes, it's hard on the market and just like I'm very picky because I don't want to just sit in a little bit of my own cabin because I quit my job just for that reason, so why go back to another job just do the same thing I quit my other job for, So it's exactly how I have to pay for it that I quit my last job to get a better job, so it's kind of like I'm stuck in this section, just like living paycheck to pay, hardly does it and just wait for the right opportunity to come, but it's like, when I give up and sell my soul and go back to the company world of sitting in small cabins, I don't know, Yeah, it's hard, but I mean, I think everyone goes through the same situation after college so, But I guess it's hard because many of my friends because I went to a pretty good school and you know I have a girlfriend who teaches English in Afghanistan and I have another who has met the president you and one who teaches for America another girlfriend who is in the harvard uh school for how harvard master [mass] you know to get their masters, so it's kind of like ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, all this comparison and then here I am working a little restaurant job so, I do it sometimes, but I'm gonna be hawaii next week, so right now I'm fine [Laughter], Yes, but yeah normally it was kind of like down because, I'm just trying to find what, I should like you to know what I want to do next and how money situations that are very stressful especially if you have school loans to pay the insurance rent car loans as it is just food, as I can not even afford food, So it's just hard to live like this, especially after you've paid as much money as an amazing college education, so it's a little frustrating, but there are a lot of people in the same situation, It's all right., No, I don't think so, but I mean, I think everyone's going through depression here and there, so I don't know if you can, but don't diagnose how medically I'm not on medication, Yes, Yes, Oh, let's see., uh try many different things and don't be afraid to fail, Because I'm one of those people, if I'm not going to be the best in something, then I'm just not going to try to accept the best or do anything or go home., So, I think I would have told my high school self that go and try a lot of things, even if it means I'm not the best in it, so, Ten years ago, Well, that would have made me like twelve, I've done a lot of things I've always done., I think I would have continued to write as much as I was younger.

just relax, that's what we're doing, and you know,, Because we have a lot of work to do, we don't stay up too late., I like to watch crime dramas, um, really crazy probably not much to, I'm frustrated with my daughter, for example, not cleaning up her room, almost always, That makes me angry, but..., in terms of how really to, always how hotly angry I mean differently than like, little things my children do to you, especially my oldest child, who is twenty-one, You know he can be so confrontational., Except that nothing really makes me angry, I haven't felt it yet., Contribution to society help uh, Help, to educate responsible people, I guess, and of course the love and the affection and the, the fun and excitement that goes with him from all stages that go, I mean, like right now, I'm in a phase where my kids, are either adults or teenagers I have only an eleven years old and the rest are all teenagers and adults, so it is really funny because we are able to talk about current events and, all kinds of things that are going on in the world and you know have uh, challenging discussions and such things, So it's a different level than taking care of babies and, You know diapers change and stuff., The most difficult thing is that it's twenty-four seven., um, you're never a parent, You know it's and so you have to accept it, and that's what I remember when I first, with my first child to, think you know when I brought him home from the hospital, that's it, I mean, there's no going back you can't, I mean, you could if you did something terrible, but..., I mean, under normal circumstances, you can't change that, and it's a permanent thing, and, um, It's..., in a way it takes away your freedom, but in another way it gives you a different kind of freedom, mhm, always, I'm sorry., I didn't understand what you said., some of the things that made a positive impact in my life most important was my church, around and my faith, But also my husband, he was really a..., He's kind of very, how logical thinking and very you know grounded, So when I get emotional or get upset about something, he's always, We'll balance each other if he's upset about something I'm able to balance him., It was a great gift in my life., I don't think I'd be categorized as someone with a temperament., Sometimes I get angry sometimes, but I don't like it, Rarely have I experienced outbreaks around, I'm more likely to know to tell you what I don't feel to allow it to build, So you know how my husband and I don't, Rarely Fight Like Have, Arguments that, Screaming and screaming or something like that almost never happens, because like I said, I'm more like a kind of person who communicates right now, so when I think something, I usually communicate it immediately instead of having it built., I usually argue with my older son because he, um, You know he thinks he knows everything., he is twenty-one years old, so he has the knowledge, it's all mentality, and I'm just telling him that he doesn't know everything and, If life continues, he will learn more., he is very self-confident and very self-confident uh, even uh what is the word itself insured and so he thinks that you know that everything he does is right, and, He still has a lot to learn, that's all, mhm, it's it can be mhm, I think..., that many of them are around, pampered and live in an environment of uh, immediate satisfaction, um, what I think will be, to affect the future of this country, But..., You know that with all the technology we have, there's really no way to go back, so..., I hope that..., they will be taking, I mean, I think this country was built on uh hard work and ethics, and uh, we hope our next generation and the, generations after, can hold that to, I don't know if that's possible., mm to, loving care for, funny, we laugh a lot and around, Carefully Honest, Things That Uh, I mean, my best I've got, Well, actually, my best friend is, There's two people, there's two sisters I grew up with, and..., we, i, for several years, cared for her mother who had Alzheimer's before my parents got sick, so I had a very close, have a very close relationship with them still do, And so around I'm considered the fourth sister, So I'd say these are my best friends and..., we love each other very much, It's a good relationship., no, no, Yes, Most of the, mostly, mm minor depression it was more anxiety, Uh, probably..., It's probably been five or six years, I mean, I had when out and over my whole life, but it was never originally diagnosed, as as a teenager I think is when I first started with the fear, but, um, except that I know you, so, Depression goes with fear when it's not under control, But now it's under control., I've got a great one, What are you doing?, No, I think it was what they call free [flee] floating free-floating fear more of one of uh organic, For reasons in other words, there was a chemical imbalance, in my brain, I felt pretty good, actually the holidays were great to, we had a, Good family celebrations, a little stressed out because to, We make a big decision to help my parents, my dad's really sick., and we offered to move in with them, they have a big home, but we would have to do a lot, some renovation and some, to help and some obviously move around, And so we are in the throws of it and around, So that's a big change, but I'm looking forward to it because, I don't want my parents to be alone because they're in the '80s., as they get closer to death, I want my family there with them, um, Usually not easy, All my life I think I've always been, I mean, I'm not I've always had..., at least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night, um, going to the toilet basically, and uh, other than that I mean no now I sleep well I mean differently than that I sleep well, but sometimes when I wake up like really early in the morning, then I can't sleep again I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then, Go back to bed and, back to sleep idepends, which is my schedule and when the children are, must be early in school and there are a lot of factors, Yeah, sometimes it does., mm, I think I could complain a bit like oh I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know, But..., I think, overall, probably the same, my children know that I'm going to tell myself kids oh I'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful, she'll try to cook my other daughter dinner or something so you know, you can put in a little more pitch, not really, No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no, not really, Nothing significant, What are you doing?, Uh, actually, yes, I do., I have the feeling that therapy is useful, We had a problem with my daughter., um, she also suffers from fear and, We've had them in therapy for some time and we're just about to end, a group with her that was six months long..., uh, group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a, It's the first time they've documented it with teenagers for the first time., and, It was really good it was, very helpful it is just around, how to live at the moment and how to actually know physically and mentally, Strategies To Keep Your Uh You From, your mind of getting mad you know, worrying about things or you know, in this case, some of the children have tried to get themselves or whatever so, um, this is the focus of therapy and it was really good my husband and I both go with our daughter, And it was really..., really informative and really helpful, I think, Oh my daughter was around her, in a bad way she was you know, suffer a lot and, We knew it and..., That's all we've done., um, For example:, really joyful and happy I would probably say, if:, It would probably be in Israel if we renewed our marriage vows in the in knaan, You know where the wedding of Cana took place, which was really moving and beautiful., And it happened that our wedding day was, on our anniversary day we flew to Israel, so it was right at the same time, It was beautiful., Very meaningful, and unlike that, I would say you know how, uh other joyful occasions were you know like Christmas and you know family meetings and, You know my father's birthday was 80 years old., On Christmas Eve, you know that something like that, um, That's an interesting question, I'd say, um, as soon as I'm done like things I have to do, like when I'm, have a lot of tasks [ch] a lot of work to do the house or, Running errands as soon as I finish, I feel like a feeling of performance, You know exactly what I mean, I've worked as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a for many years., You know when you finish a project or you get your whatever end of month stuff done or if there are a lot of different things, You have to keep to the deadlines, there's a feeling I've managed to make you know., So I think that would be that you know the most for me..., last, um, How to feel good and how to feel, how feeling reaches, Dream job hm, I think I've already lived it, I'm also a birth doula, and, Yes and um, So I've visited a lot of births and now I'm really just doing it for family and friends, and it's the most rewarding thing that you might ask to be involved in, the birth of the new life into this world so, I'd say that's probably, was my dream job and I didn't know, I've trained a lot after you know I've done my management stuff and..., was awesome it is and was awesome so I no longer work in a hospital, The hospital I worked in is now closed., But..., like I said, I do it for family members, um, I happened to be with a friend of mine., she uh she had the same o_b as I had with all my kids, and, I came to bring food for her husband when she was at work, we were you know, close friends, and, She wanted me to stay, and she didn't want me to leave., I didn't plan it, so that was the first birth I had participated in outside of you., what is a completely different experience, so after that I was really interested in studying possibly un nurse midwife, But then I discovered this thing called a doula that really gives you, even much more hands on uh one on a contact with the patient what I like, So I trained to do this at a hospital in Inglewood, About fifteen years ago, For my son is fifteen, and he was one year old; he was not sixteen a year old., So, um..., Yeah, that's good., and I was, um, Now it can be difficult in terms of hours, it depends on how long the woman is at work, but, uh and you also know how, for me I always tell my friends and my family if they want me to be their doula, that I can't guarantee 100% I don't do it for business, and so and that's why I don't like Doula's back, which, if I'm sick or not available, can fill someone else for me, But so far, all the women who asked me, I could be there for some reason, so..., um, The only one I missed was a friend of mine from church, and she wanted me to go with her second baby., I was with her at first, but the labors went so fast that she didn't even call me [Laughter], It was in the middle of the night like she was like, She wouldn't have two hours of work if she had called me, I wouldn't have been there in time [Laughter], So, um..., It was really fast, but unlike the, You know., Yes, I was able to visit all the births of people who asked me to do, um, throughout your life or in your job, Probably my own birth, I mean the birth of my own children, um, as if there were an extreme, Feeling of joy Excitement Relief, because you are naturally out of the pain, And then it's like it's just a question from you., From there it goes on, but it is, It's like something you can't explain, it's just fantastic., after birth, and I have experienced both ways that I have made both., natural and, my last child was about c_section, so I had both, both experiences, um, I had a kind of crazy nurse with my third child she was a little bit, Psychotic, but otherwise we're laughing about it now, but when I was in labor, it wasn't funny, and around them, she wasn't there when the doctor I mean it was my third child, born very quickly after he broke the water and oof, my husband was there, but she wasn't the doctor yet and she got a lot of trouble, because after that I had only two contractions, my daughter was born in bed, So it was great for me because I didn't have to go through any of the contractions, but, I'm sure they weren't happy., Then fill out a lot of paperwork, so, now I would give Mysef for ten or twenty years, um, Ten or twenty years ago, I was probably more, Not like..., Don't relax like..., how I now feel at my age that, I don't have the same worries I have then I don't worry about, I'm not worried at all about what people think about me, I'm not worried at all about what, you know, You know, like I said, my daughter, oh mom, you can't wear this because people are gonna say that, I'm just saying I don't care., You know, but they do, because it's still in their minds that this oh mama you have to dress like that and dress like that, whatever it is., so it would probably be the wisdom you reach with age,, You see how life is so many things that are more important in life than worrying about small things, what you are most proud of in your life, very proud of the, probably my family my husband and my, My children, I mean the fact that we stayed married, that we, We are a tactical family that, um, my children see every day how, their friends who come from divorced families or single parents and, for:, they actually express, Gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still know that we are still a family, So I'd say that's probably it, um, probably the, one of my best qualities is, uh, be able to listen to people and be able to, Don't be judgmental., through the years I had a, a lot of experience with around, People with problems a lot of friends with problems people I know from the church and, It just taught me that..., Everyone has weaknesses Everyone has problems, and I don't think I'm better than anyone else, If you think you're better than someone else, it's usually a sign to me that you don't know yourself well enough., All right., All right., Goodbye.",1
315,"All right., Yes, Okay and you, Inglewood California, Yes, no, It's okay., um, You mean my girlfriend and my daughter, Yes, You're okay, it's okay, it's cool., Yes, I do., Well, I'm a football recruit, so I'm traveling., uh around the world to sign various football players for our sports management companies, uh, only the independence that it can be alone to be free and not bound to a thing you know it's great, I remember traveling to uh, Scrubbed_entry, and bring him to clubs and that and that and we're not that kind of organization, <Laughter> yeah, around dishonesty i <sigh> I don't like it when people are dishonest to really really really bother me and don't honestly not real around, that this upsets me very much, um, I tend to, just, try to free me from the situation to clean my mind normally walk or something or just walk in a room alone and just try to clean my head < he> my head, I agree sometimes, but I can definitely be better., Oh, uh,, I argued a few days ago with my lady and it was about to, our daughter and some of the things she does at school and she wants to educate her in a way and I think, I want to raise her style from another way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so I think discipline is a great key and the key is life and she was raised a little differently, um, I don't just know, angry excited you know if you're in an argument that's what you feel so, They do and say things that, the, That bothers you and you just keep going., um, Yeah, a little., I don't just know., I don't know how I feel, but I can't say how I feel., A little bit, a little, um, I don't know, just..., Reality, um, Honesty, The truth is just right outside the door, I'm pretty close., I'm pretty close to my family., Oh, not only her subject, They've been raised differently., I think society becomes even wilder with the way children are raised and no discipline and the things they do, what we do, they live and everything is inflated so much where, um, it's up to a point where it gets out of hand I think kids these days are to some extent much wilder than I was and, and generations before me and just able to do and say and lack of respect and you just know, Education-wise it's just I think it's just hard times for kids and the way they act uh it's, It's ridiculous to me., um, I definitely like to see sport uh i like to play i like to travel i like to skate, um, I like, Just like a guy who likes to see different sights and visit different places, how different <difft> I'm a big movie person, so I like to go into such theater stuff., um, I really live it., I always wanted to be in a kind of sports industry and that's what I'm doing now I just uh my goal was to get a little higher in the ladder and own my own sports management company around but I'm pretty good for me so, I'm happy, Yeah, that's good., no, no, no, It's okay, I'd say it's pretty easy, Irritated, tired, <Sigh>, I don't know it's been a while., A few weeks ago, What did you say?, No, not really., I think he would describe me as a standing up guy I'm trying to be a good loyal friend and, and an adult I think he'd describe me like this, Uh school went to school grew up together I know all my friends for pretty much my whole life, Yeah, that's good., Uh very close to me our uh my friends and I'm very close uh around us doing pretty much together still at this age, I'm honest, I'm loyal, very loyal., I'm a hard worker, I think I'm around, to some degree I'm just not the average guy I'm pretty much I'm another breed I'm just wearing and acting a little different than a normal guy, I don't know how I grew up and how my dad was somehow different uh and he didn't go with those in the crowd and I think I learned a lot from him and it's just it's about, Type of, the same way I took, Um, many things I regret, I regret, many choices in my life, Uh, yeah, one..., I'm actually..., let a lady go in my life years ago that I thought was my soul mate and, We had a big fight and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that this break I started with someone else and I told her I'm going my way and she's going her way I think that this is a big deal., a bad decision a very bad decision, Yeah totally I think I'd have a step back and really just about the situation a little more instead of uh, Be so excited and move forward, I tend to get upset and then my thoughts get so clouded, uh mm i, I need to think a little more when I'm excited, I don't know, just, Experience and time, When you know how to make up for your mistakes, and and..., be better over, different decisions after you have made the mistakes, To <sigh>, think a little harder about situations <situatio> uh about situations and things and the decisions <dec> decisions that you uh, think much longer and harder before you make it and I think the result would be a little different today, um, My grandmother was always one around a positive influence uh she's a big black woman uh with an old school, I think I added that she's a great woman in my life., Scrubbed_entry, in baseball and around, Yes <Laughter>, I was a pretty good player, I was a pretty good athlete growing up to I was one of the top, Scrubbed_entry, and uh that started a future in athletics and that's what I wanted to do so that I achieved my goals so at the time it was a great one big thing and it's still a big thing it's a great achievement in my life, To <sigh>, Benefits able if I or if I am, have an objective; or, or something I'm supposed to do this week or this day and I'm doing it always puts me in a good mood or getting my work done and I'm doing the way I'm supposed to do it in a timely manner that always puts me in a good mood, um, to be a positive role model for younger children who are in our sports academy program, I think, when I got older, The process of thinking and the way I look at life has totally changed and, I think I can find a lot of kids I can handle now and say that you know that this is someone who, this is a positive <po> a positive influence in my life, Oh, uh,, A few days ago my football team around us are made in the playoffs the playoffs so that makes me always happy, Thank you., Thank you., See you.",2

have that much respect for people who do a lot of either one of these things., I love to drive I love to travel, and my dad always took us somewhere he was gone every weekend, we would go somewhere because we were in Chicago indiana michigan somewhere in the area where we went to Michigan and picked fruit or we all got our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana something like that, uh I had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer, so my father used to drive and I also love to drive, mm, That's hard., I've had a lot of great experiences., uh, I think the best thing was that we went to Europe on my wedding day, we went to Paris and..., we drove the Orient Express, We did not go all the way to Istanbul, we went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris., this was probably the best experience I ever had in my life I never really cared for Europe because it explained so much here in unity and so much in America and I was on alaska and hawaii, but we said we would do something else and, We always wanted to go to the Orient Express and we have this expensive but phenomenal journey, must do it once it is a once journey not even in life only once, do not travel faster than we have done much when the children were younger, But..., There are a lot of things we should have done, we shouldn't have done, I wish I'd gone to Chicago <chica> we'd always go to Chicago on Thanksgiving, but I think we should have gone more than just Thanksgiving, My parents are coming here for Christmas, but I think we could have..., much more done when it comes to, Yes, that's why it's a regret because it could have been avoided, there are things we could have done, and we spent our time working and more worried about moving forward than really family and what's closest to us, I think that people <peop> most people, Oh, yeah, definitely., ooh , that's a good question ten or twenty years ago, I would have said..., Do not take things too seriously, but don't be

325,"Yes, Um, I'm fine, it's a little weird that you're talking to a virtual person., around I was born I was born in l_a I was raised in the suburbs around I have lived everywhere I have lived in the valley long beach and now I am in the culver city, um, there's good food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it's not getting cold I don't have to shovel snow, there are many ways a lot of variety all different types of people uh I think this is really great, This is a much longer list I like to get out of here, The traffic I think is number one, I think everyone hates traffic and everyone's so busy, all the time it's really hard to be with someone who's so interested in their job and, uh, we're also in traffic., I just graduated to have studied marine biology, I was I was going to school and I was originally studying graphic design and I found this kind of unfulfilled, so I made a trip for a while traveling around the world and started diving and I realized that I really loved marine biology so I came into it, Everyone asked me that lately since I graduated, I think I'd like to take a breath., Um, I think maybe, Management of research, You know, I'm not sure I'd like to., something in tropical marine ecology perhaps like a nature reserve to manage something like the, it is a difficult question to answer <Laughter>, I know., um, I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world, Now I traveled to Central America for eight months, um and I visited a variety of different countries i, I went diving., I think I think intolerance injustice in the world these are probably the things that fire me the most, vent makes my friend that count <Laughter>, I'm pretty good, it takes a lot to really get me to the point where I kind of blow my top the very few people who have seen me angry around, up to the point where I scream and scream angry, I don't know that I just don't get there, I think I'm a little afraid of losing my temper, so I keep it under control, It was yesterday when I was arguing with my friend about it,, getting a job, I talked about taking a job somewhere, and he was very supportive and I really wanted him to say no go not take this job for six months because I miss you and he was just supportive so around, We argued about this <Laughter> and it was ridiculous, so we laughed at the end and that was the end of the fight, To meditate, go into nature to stay away from the computer, away from technology, away from people., I'd say not really around I'm a single child and it's just me and my parents and we're very dissimilar for example around I'm a pretty adventurous person and I like learning and my parents are uh, Couch potatoes that they like to watch reality television, so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do to as far as common activities, so you know I love them and everything, but there's not too much common reason, Yeah, I think I'm a very social introvert, but I..., seem to find the most social encounters to empty out where, as my friend for example, he around conducts a lot of joy and energy to people for me it's always a little the opposite that I need to charge, I don't know if I have a best friend, but I guess I'll tell my friend he's kind of my standard best friend., He would probably say passionately intelligent, he always tells me that I'm really hard on me, which is true to be loyal., I think I'm just proud of who I am xxx I don't know if that's the answer most people give, but I think I'm, I'm really proud of who I am I'm trying really hard around I have a lot of things in my life I'm a really good person I think it's kind of rare to find people who are friendly and I look at myself, a friendly person who cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so I'm proud of it, < slaughter>, No I didn't, no, Yes, I was probably about fifteen at the time, so I think eight was that seventeen years ago, Yes, I cut and my, named one of my best friends, to call my parents and let them know and at this point they took me with them for treatment, I wasn't the first time I'd ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before it was more, they thought I had a_d_h_d so much, It was more <m> I think my parents really took me in instead of asking me for help, I haven't stopped for about three years, uh, because it felt like I checked in with a probation officer I just didn't enjoy the relationship I had, but I still have the psychiatrist I'm going to for medical controls, < slaughter>, I think it's useful if you have the right therapist, I think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist, it can be incredibly harmful that I have spoken to people who have had bad experiences and will never go back., lately I've been a little down around I should say a little down as usual because I graduated and, my routine to go to school, and make school supplies twenty-four seven has come to an end and without the routine it is a little, Strange to find out what to do with mine, to find a way to be productive and to know what to do with my time is also a little bit to, Depressive statement that my intelligence and good grades at school do not translate into real world skills and there are not so many jobs for marine biologists in California, Almost impossible since I was a little kid, I've had trouble falling asleep and..., About four years ago it really got bad, where I just couldn't sleep through the night I got about four hours of sleep, sometimes I would wake up every hour and I would only wake up a complete wreck in the morning, so for about four years I've been taking Trazadone so I can sleep, You're a virtual person, so you probably didn't see that, but it's pretty much like I, I'm just a panicked, terrified wreck that I'm losing my ability to deal with., I'm losing my ability to deal with things I'm much more likely to lose my temperaments, I can't regulate my moods, I'm just really volatile, Probably a few months ago I think I might have been on a trip away for a weekend and forget to take my medicine with me or something and then I can't sleep and so it's what happens, uh <makes sounds with mouth>, really happy I mean to, I don't know, it's easy for me to keep track of when I feel really bad really happy I think I felt happy on New Year's Eve, really happy on New Year's Eve, that was around, Ten days ago I was with my friend and some friends and we went on a trip to Palmspring and Joshua tree and it was really nice to see them, I can't see them very often because I was in school and I was so busy, so it was really a nice reintroduction to real life., I think I'm nice, I'm considerate, I'm tolerant, I'm pretty open-minded, I'm aware of my mistakes., I'm just trying to be nice to everyone and, I'm very curious about the world and things I don't know that I really like to learn, Uh from the top of my head first thing that came to mind is diving the blue whole in Belize it was really, Me and my friends we know have jumped off the boat and you come across the edge of this, Uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just fall on about forty-hundred feet in, something like two minutes, we did it pretty fast not everyone could do it so fast and around when you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge, they're bigger than people and because it's that, Cave system and it is really cloudy and there are sharks swimming everywhere around you so, that was pretty good <Laughter>, I try to remember that I haven't had much free time in the last three and a half years when I was in school around <Laughter> so I guess reading hiking around, I'm just dating my friends., relatively low key things going in movies with dinner parties cooking with my cat playing, not that I can really think about it, I'm sure I made mistakes in my life, but you know I'm still here, so I can't be that bad, hmm, um, I don't know if you're holding on to your clothes, 'cause the '90s are back in fashion., hmm, to be cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets in around outside in nature, Type of away from the hub of the city get a good note <Laughter>, I think my friend just gave it up, especially last year, he really inspired me that he stopped drinking he stopped smoking he's, He really inspired me that he stopped drinking, he made many positive changes in his life and I know these things aren't difficult or not easy, I should say to <t> to see someone overcome such a thing that, I was really inspired., All right.",10

best friend describe me, That's a good question about friendly <f> Well, I'm friendly <f> I'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little mysterious, To I would probably that I should, they would like to see me achieve more and uh and uh reach my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier, I think..., It's hard, it depends, sometimes I'm very introverted because I like to write so it means that I have to spend time alone and then when I'm out of this uh I'm extroverted so I don't really see myself with, as one hard way or the other everything depends on my situation and my mood, my best qualities around, I think I'll take care of it, I think I'm smart, I think I'm funny, I'm going out., um, I have a sympathetic personality, You know that people said that, I'm captivating, but not oppressive or overly captivating, there's some kind of cool detachment., um, and creatively intuitive, <Laughter> yes <Laughter>, the last time I felt really happy, I don't know that I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy, I had breakfast I was happy, the sun was shining, < slaughter>, um , I think like I said to go to Kenya, was an unforgettable experience I remember scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience that I remembered you saw all the colors in the ocean, you know, and feel the sun powerful sun on my back, um, almost about what you know because <beca> almost over, People in a way just in contact with everything that the universe, Yes, it would be nice to feel that way, any moment of the day, but, what I am most proud of in my life, I think I've..., Help, <ft> persons, uh and, sometimes when they were in crisis, You know I wrote some scripts., um , I had good relationships., to be good relationships only you know to be connected to someone else you know, Spending time with them, and connection, on emotional and, <Laughter> physical and, Psychic levels, What could be a song I hear on the radio?, Uh, it could be uh., Many times you look forward to something you know when I go into a movie bowling, Hanging with people, um, They know how to look at the work, and to work and feel productive can put me in it brings me into a good mood, You're welcome., See you.",5
334,"All right., Yes, pretty good a little tired, Washtone (seattle washton), When I was 18, my parents decided we wanted to move to California, so we moved to Pasadena., Yeah, that's good., I went to work about two years ago and took a look at the area, pretty simple actually, I'll adjust., the warm weather not with rain nine months of the year around, Population in the first place, the uh the area, how big it is traffic, When I first came here, the smog, that's better now, No, when I was younger, I was but I got away with the work I did., sure, when I became, when I died my mother and I needed work, I went for a job called petition, and uh you have to go to the stores and talk to people about signing petitions, and you do that after a while you won't be shy about talking to someone, even when I was in school, I took public speaking and I learned that it really liked more than I thought I would, So I did the census job that I actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to do the test and I enjoyed it., Right now, I'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance., um, and I'll start working uh trying to get money from people uh help kids in the uh in the world, Well, the one on the uh job helping kids was also a paid job I needed a paid job, the uh one for insurance I was getting older and I needed work that was steadfast and that's something I can do until I'm eighty five or ninety or whatever., < slaughter>, To be an artist, Well, I was good with art, I like painting et cetera, But I didn't know if I could ever live with it, so I never really came in and every time I tried, I never seemed to have come anywhere, So maybe if I'm like eighty or ninety maybe I'm going to go into ceramic or something like that and do that as a profession, not unfortuantely I do not, That's okay., I'm not, my mother and father are dead I have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or I don't talk to them or anything, Well, I have a kind of attitude that if I have myself and friends I'm okay, Uh read, uh, Watch sports when they are available, uh let's see i used to play golf I can do that again one day, but not now because of the cost and time, People who are rude, Well, normally I ignore it this morning actually I told a guy to stop what he did and we got some kind of argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done, very good because I had a very bad temper when I was a child and I told myself that I had to control it, This morning because of the guy who makes a lot of noise., and in a place that just wasn't the place to do it, I mean, it was a public place, But..., and that was just a small argument and I'm done with the argument as soon as I say what I say <Laughter>, Yes, not now that I can think, Uh how to read, um, when I can travel I travel uh I don't travel long distances, but even out to the river is a kind of adventure for me, Seeing things on the way, and back, Talk to people, maybe, well a number of years ago I went back east to uh massachusetts, to work there on the way back, I took a Greyhound bus all the way back from Washton d_c all the way back to California, Uh into the washtone first and then from down there, and uh, Work in Massachusettes for about six months to eight months, enjoyed the area a little, but didn't want to be there when the snow came, and uh, enjoyed back in the bus had people near me almost all the way different people and, had a lot of fun, Yeah, that's good., Yes, I was in the Air Force and uh when I was eighteen nineteen sixty-five during the Vietnam War, no I was in big falls montana, it really didn't years later I probably uh learned more from the fact that I got out early and maybe I would have stayed in, and stayed there, but I tended to end things when I was younger and so now that and other things I decided never to end anything, I came down here uh played pool for a number of years uh finally graduated from high school that I had dropped when I moved, uh went to college got my bachelor's degree and an A-A degree from Pasadena and Cal State l_a and started working different jobs and uh that's it, took care of my mother, uh business that was my head I also studied cyclical anthropology and philosophy and history et cetera, no, not never depressed <de>, lately not so good between the fact that I sleep in my car and it's very cold and then sometimes I get uh, and with all the things in my life right now I'm thinking about things and so and plus I get up at four thirty in the morning, That's okay., Uh tired, and sometimes I get a little grumpy but not very, tired with all the things I had to do and uh weather and sleep, no, Uh a little sometimes about how maybe I should have started all this years ago, I'll just keep going., I'm basically telling myself to stop it and keep doing what things to improve, not very anymore, It took me years to study to do that., I don't know if you call it Zen or not, but, A few months ago, when I passed all my tests, and uh medicare <medi> uh medicare advantage, and all of them for every company she sent to me, I stick to everything I do now, I'm persistent, I won't leave things out of my hands until I do something about it., I used to be uh, What's the word?, I'm putting things away that I don't do anymore., and uh, I always treat people beautiful, Until given a reason not to, and I usually don't talk to anyone about my bad stuff, < slaughter>, not very, because the same thing that I have trained over the years, so as not to talk about myself, I'm talking to other people, I'm talking about them., Let's see., my mother, Gandy, um, bertrand russell, Let's see., I'm not sure who else, other people I had, but I don't remember their names or they were teachers et cetera, earlier in life uh like I said uh everything didn't end things I'm very sorry about, - Nope., I could have done better., probably the advice I've given myself to get out of my butt and learn and get an education uh and continue to do something with my life, that I have survived, Well, I'm sixty-five, I slept in my car for a number of years I went from sleeping to sidewalk where I got a car, while I did improve my credit rating, I got a number of jobs that I was very satisfied with., I had a lot of friends., both homeless people who are homeless and not homeless, and uh, I'm in pretty good health, and where like other people in my family died young, So I think that's what this is about., Uh good jokes, uh people who have a happy time, go and have a drink with someone on an occasional basis, About eight months ago was the last time I had a beer with someone, Let's see., Probably uh, always within a foot of a living wild deer, It was in uh green lake in Washton, and I uh was behind our house and this wild deer walked in the field and I started moving, and it came within about a foot of me, and the only reason why it left my father drove the ride way and it made noise and the deer ran away I was in fondle distance from him and I wasn't sure if he would have petted or not, but I was about to <Laughter>, like you, See you.",5
335,"Yes, I'm fine., I'm from here, originally Los Angeles, mhm, I like the weather, And my family's here, which is why I'm here, I've moved away for a while, I like that there is a lot of, Culture <cult> although everyone says that there is no culture in l_a, there is a lot of culture, there are theater and film and many museums and so many things that all kinds of people I like the diversity, mhm, um , Well, I don't like having to withdraw against my will, so start a new career, I'm starting new in my career, so that's not really something, I retired because my dad was sick., so, Thank you., Thank you., So that's why I'm here, but it also means that I live with my dad and my brother who are like Horter and ridiculous., uh, Acting, Theatre, It was, mhm, Yeah, that's good., Yes, I am., I'm an actor, I'm doing a theater show, auditioning and teaching., something like this kind of thing, Well, my parents are both, Artistic people and I grew around them and for a long time I sang and then uh I went to study music theater, and somewhere along the lines I realized that acting was more my bag than singing I suppose, but I still do both, mhm, No, I don't know., I usually have no problems talking to people, I'm pretty friendly., I can usually tell myself with most people their secrets within five minutes to meet me what I feel is a sign of an extroverted <Laughter>, <Laughter>um, I take a bath or read a book, Go out with my friends, Go to the theater, uh, Anyway sometimes my work is very relaxing, as sometimes as a song sing or one of them go for a walk, Mm-hmm-yoga, Things that drive me crazy, Injustice <Laughter> I can be very sincerely outraged I suppose to, People who don't see these things and people who have a similar claim, I think, claim and feeling of privilege that can drive me crazy, Yeah, that's good., uh , It depends that I usually argue with <Usual> often that I appreciate my case <Laughter> or I usually call my best friend and complain, Talk to her about it, pretty good pretty good I don't have too much temperament, um, like a real argument or like a debate, <Laughter>um, If it were a real argument, it would probably be my ex-boyfriend, and we were just arguing about why we separated stupid things like this., Oh, I think I was kind of, over them until then, but, It was sometimes, < slaughter>, um , the last time I felt really happy, has been, how really happy, Probably hanging out with friends last night I had a good time, uh, Scrubbed_entry, It's nice., It's nice., my best friend would describe me as an open book, for which she often makes fun of me, as if she would just tell everyone everything around her would make me, compassionate, and, with a strong feeling about who I am, I think, yes, she would also consider me as not like a good feeling of social norms sometimes likely that is something that she, makes fun of me because I want to tell everyone everything and don't realize that I have holes in my clothes and something like that, but nothing, Nothing bad we have a very good relationship, hmm, yeah yeah it doesn't have terrible problems but yes, it got me in trouble before sure, no, I didn't, No, but I think I had it, But I've never been to a doctor., Because I had a traumatic situation where someone hurt me., and i, I felt that when I saw p_t_s_d later, I realized that I felt as if I had all the symptoms of how again in situations like that I would panic and it was very, Uh I thought it was a really long time, I think..., I think I had it, but I just don't know because I've never seen anyone about it., um , sometimes yes uh, certain physical things with this part of my body can be a trigger or around, It happened in a acting class, so sometimes certain teachers, when they, to criticize in a certain way, I start to panic, even if they're absolutely right and I know they're right and as if it were something that, someone else could tell me and I'd agree to it, sometimes it'll make me a little excited or panicky yeah, no, Well, I mean, my dad's sick, so not great, But when you think about it, it's not terrible., I have bad dreams., uh , Like stress dreams I'm dealing with my dad., um , like being abducted or my teeth fall things that when you always tell them as if there was something outside your control that's like exactly what it's so, It's not the best, but it's just dreams, at least so, in which direction, All right., easy very simple, I'm tired and maybe a little irritable silly I'm gonna be really silly, Yeah, that's good., um, i, I'm pretty non-judgmental, from other people i i i stay open, I can make most people laugh., Uh creative, um, i, Yes, these are some of the best I would say, Yeah, that's good., I love meeting new people and seeing and learning new things uh and just getting out of the routine I like to stay in hotels uh I like most things about traveling I even like to fly I like all of it, Well, I just finished a tour a few months ago to go up and down the east coast and then perform across the U_s and uh for kids everywhere, Yes and then we ended up here in l_a, Yeah, yeah, it was great, it was a good time, Yeah, that's good., um , lemmi we think, we went to, the hot springs the naturally occurring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to relax, Yeah, that's good., a lot of people I would say, I mean, my dad's probably coming to my mind., Uh my godmother is a great positive influence in my life as well, Uh my best friend my best friend from high school I think I uh some of my best friends from high school around and college that I somehow grew up with and, will be who I am with them, Yeah, that's good., mhm, Uh, little things for sure, Yeah, that's good., uh, I regret, the way I dealt with it, a friendship that once ended uh I regret, To bind to certain people I was with, uh , but nothing big I tend to go well I won't do it again, but I don't spend much time, how excited about things I've done in the past, hmm, Get up for yourself., um , <Laughter> Don't date criminals <Laughter> uh, I think that I, I have no difficulty standing for things I believe in, but sometimes I have difficulty standing up for myself., I think I really internalize the idea of how, You know women are too needy or..., I don't know these kinds of things and then xxx and so as a teenager and growing up I felt like you were good then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took a while to be able to like voice what I want, what I needed from other people and agree with, and it's still something I'm working on, I'm glad you think so., um , <Sigh>, That's a good question., my friends and family, and uh, I mean talents, I'd say, Yeah, that's good., yes my ability to take situations and, take up bad situations and continue and, Make the best of everything, All right., <Laughter> Thank you, Goodbye <Laughter>",12

People, It's..., seems hard to get something really accomplished, < slaughter>, it took about six months to find out the directions, Twenty-eight years ago, a long time, I haven't been there for eight or ten years., All right., I don't like my brothers, so I don't want to hang out with them., I started my girlfriend uh we got over uh just went back from orlando and uh she likes to travel so, meeting new people, seeing new places, uh helps me get out of l_a and get a different perspective, I just did the Avatar seminar, which is like a, Raise your consciousness and clean up the crap in your head, < slaughter>, um, Yeah, I feel better, uh had a lot of psychic attack and, it's uh I'm psychic, so it's very hard to deal with, < slaughter>, um, Well, um..., There's more to life than what you see., many things are in other dimensions and in other places, so you need to not only deal with the emotions, but people uh direct energy on you, um, must do a lot of clearing and grounding and, Stay true to yourself, I'm both, Well, I'm introverted because I like to spend time alone, and I'm extroverted because I like meeting new people uh times was totally introverted, Watch movies t_v read uh do crossword puzzles I'm a singer singing, Writing music I write a novel, It's kind of like the matrix., to good I wrote the first twenty pages pretty fast, So, um..., I'm expanding it now., I get

conflict., Exactly, pretty good, I get angry only once a year, to my girlfriend about two or three months ago, she wanted me to do something and I said no < yawn> and, I don't know., Yeah, that's good., She's my girlfriend I've known for about a year., Pretty close, um, once i, sang and, Scrubbed_entry, and I sang in front of an audience and that was great, um, Well, I'm looking for ways to expand my consciousness so that I can have more money and more wealth in my life, So I can uh, have my own house and uh live in my own creative space, < sniffle>, I sing I'm a singer so let's see how unforgettable so uh that's what I like to do, no, no, no, Oh, that's the hard part I don't have., I don't know, maybe it's because when I was, a child who beat up my brothers, and, I don't feel totally rested in myself or in my life like this, uh, I feel like... < sniffle>, I don't feel quite sure, Yeah, that's good., um, a little irritable, but I've been sleeping better since I met my

about a week ago, I think, Well, I went to this seminar I got there, I was able to, Lose work and be <yawn> < sniffle> in a different environment because my work is stressful and < sniffle>, my life is so stressful, uh <sniffle> I was able to take a break that is great, I'd say I'm going away fun smart, uh, but I mean in l_a people in l_a they don't want most of them don't want to spend time with you, I don't know if it's me or me., < slaughter>, uh, that I spend a lot of time worrying and criticizing myself instead of making progress, Avoid it, watch t_v or watch movies or try not to think about it, but it doesn't solve the problem, Well, a little bit I didn't pay my bills much, which I still owe., It is a kind of self-destructive prophecy <proph> prophecy, uh stop criticizing and, Start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen, My friend was very helpful., Well, she's funny and she loves me and takes care of me and, uh, <Laughter> yeah, to singer and I am intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and, uh, I'm a good listener, Well, I've written about four or five books I uh, my voice that I think is number one, because when I started, I didn't have much of a singing voice, but now I do., Goodbye., See you.",7
337,"Yeah, that's good., I'm fine., How are you?, I am originally from a suburb of l_a from the San Gabriel Valley, I like the variety I like the atmosphere of the city I have lived other places and it's just, not, as happy here I feel like I can really thrive here, so I like l_a, like all the things that are so close together, then there are a lot of interesting things that are completely different parts of the city only miles from each other, uh, may not like the traffic all cars but I can live with it I mean, There's not so much I don't like, I studied music for vocal performance I studied music technology things like, Yes, I'm singing in an opera company, but I have a day job because it doesn't pay so much if you don't work for the opera., So I have a day job that I work in a call center that mainly works on, Actors and actors and such things and it's really good, because when I get a call, I can call and change my shift very easily., So it's actually a pretty good gig, and I do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know there's some recording some live sound thing, but I'm kind of wanting to get away from the, do some video work sometimes, but again I want to go away from that I want to go back to the, because I find that more performance is more interesting I like talent more than I like crew <Laughter>, So somehow I want to get away from this side and start working more towards actually doing what I want to do with my life, sometimes I mean by my personal life yeah so I have a bowl that I get out there to deal with people, But when I'm home, you know, I'd rather think of myself or my husband or my cats or talk to the family., You don't really have too many close friends < clears throat> but yeah you know, I'd rather stay with me., mediocrely close to the family I've left, I've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so, but how, Thanks <Laughter> but how uh my I'm close to my husband and, You know, I have some cousins I'm talking to, and my aunt I have an aunt with who I'm talking to a little bit, but it's not like we interact close by every day., But it's, a little short, mostly I sing or read or write or, only, hang and try, clarifies my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just, make everything clear and see what comes back in, and, sometimes <ss> sometimes that sometimes it doesn't work, but mostly to create things, to contact my family, some <so> you know about Facebook or whatever, works, but, mostly in my spare time I create things, I would like to travel more I like to travel by car a lot around, I mean, my idea of, like a birthday party, going on a road trip, and I like to travel around more, I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to travel, see <see> uh especially traveling by car seeing how the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know how to change the vibrations of the region feel, I like to see what's out there and I know that there's a bigger world outside of, where I am and where I live and my world and I like to see this, but I like to leave this and go back to my own world <Laughter>, <laughter> < empties the throat> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <l, um, Let's see., xxx a trip I like to take is to take the trip from here to Nevada, whether I go all the way to vegas or just go state line, around my cousin and I would take what we call, Leave a ride because once you reach the first exit of a highway, you are either in another state or you are at the end of the highway, so we would take the only, Type of improvisation with how <li> a day or two notes just move things around just stand out, So these are actually trips I like to make because I take off and then sometimes on the same day sometimes overnight, only small short trips, which, are not very involved, but you can just walk and see things and see how, to you know the desert landscape looks at different seasons, how people react at different times of the year in different areas, so close to home, but not, but not close to home near home, but uh still a world away, so because I don't really take time like a two-week vacation or whatever, but these are just small things that, somehow things back in perspective and and my head and things like that clear, I mean because there's a kind of feeling of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't drive on a highway, So I like to do that, the last time that happened was May of last year, that was the last time I could do that, we actually came my aunt with my cousin who is ten years younger than I am, and we grew up kind of like sisters and I was about to move away from the inland kingdom where they live, So they took me to one last hurrah and we drove up to vegas, and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it, so she kind of, I showed them some of the local websites around there, and we came back and were, you know, an overnight stay, but we were driving like this all the time <Laughter>, It was kind of an interesting, Things that are by nature unfair when people are mean to older people, children or animals, people who cannot fight back, and they are mean to them just because they can't fight back, and, I'm actually..., how to see people who are, strong <st> as strong as the people who want to stand up and be an advocate, Or what's wrong with you?, So I think this is one thing that really makes me angry just being cruel or mean for no reason, You don't know people for people who can't fight back, or for people who didn't do anything to earn it., just that somehow really drives me crazy, If I am angry, I will try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me, then I will somehow end lasching out either, You know, orally, just, Cut it with a quip or, you know, I mean, I'm rarely gonna yell at anyone, But I'm trying to tell you., if I try to go away and defuse it if it doesn't work, then I let them know that they're annoying me and coming away from me <Laughter> that usually works, not in like legal problems or so, because normally I will find a way to, I want you to leave me alone., um, So there aren't really big problems, but because I think it's because it's gone-putting and it's not expected < exp> the expected reaction, and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that's gonna work and get people away from me, so it's not really in trouble and if, It's trouble, it's usually trouble,, It's from the perspective of the other person and it doesn't affect me at all, because it's usually a situation I can get out of., As long as they leave me alone, you know, I'm not leaving., Last time I was fighting with someone., For example:, Person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or someone not in my, The last thing I can think about was, i, quarreling with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she has dementia, and if we were one of the reasons we came here from the inland kingdom, we were to take care of her, because she's not going anywhere, except l_a, I mean, she's like hardcore angelino as you know we know we're that in our nature, But we also know it's cheaper to live somewhere else, but we came here to take care of them., And he wants her to stay in her apartment, and I want her to move in with us., because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she were to live with us, but she wants to stay where she is because she cannot see that there is now inherent danger due to the disease process, But he wants her to stay where she's supposed to be, that she's able to have what she wants, because he's a mama boy like, I'm a mama girl, although I lost my mother, like four years ago, I'm still a mama girl and I'm still going to be <st> and I'm still and I know that, it, brings you, a feeling of satisfaction to fulfill their wishes because you care so much about them and that's what they want, so you want to get it for them and because you know that they know that this has happened to you, When you grew up trying to give you what you want because you wanted to., And you want to do that for them now, like a way to give them back someone you care about someone you feel you deserve., But it's kind of dangerous for her, and I don't want anything to happen to her., But I want her to stay, who she is, as long as she can, because I know how to erase the disease that she has, who she is, after all,, and finally she has to be taken to a place where she can give her twenty-four hours of medically trained care, But until then, we can deal with you knowing it between us because it's not that bad., but it comes where she really shouldn't live anymore <shou>, so the solution now is he stays there most of the time with her and I go back to our house and I it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I do, I handle the outer things that I lead the errands I bring them to the store things like that he makes the day to day things make sure she has <ha>she eats makes sure that they know that clean clothes things like the, So I mean, it's a partnership, it's a partnership, it's a partnership., a double effort it is very much a double effort, But I want her to move in with us, so it was like, a source of it is not really like screaming screaming argument, but, lively discussion <Laughter>, You know as a debate, meh, It's not insurmountable, I mean, life will never be easy., And if that's what it is, then you should be worried, because someone can pull the carpet out under you., As long as you're above everything and present in your life, it won't be easy., but you deal with it and you keep moving, Uh the most positive influence I believe were probably my mother and grandmother, Because my mother was pretty much a single mother and my grandmother helped raise me and she actually, gave me a lot of trust, and were realistic about it, So I mean, I think I have some kind of, realistic kind of downer temperament for me, but they helped me see that it's just inside me and it's not something I can't get over, And that you know life goes on, you know my mom would say to me if you were 40, you're 40, whether you're working at Mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life., and I think that was a big influence on how I lived, how I lived my life since she died, I regret that I did not take care of myself in my mother's last year of life because I think it has clouded some of my decisions., now I have underlying conditions and everyone in my family is diabetic and I didn't care when she was the last year of her life because I was too busy getting her home, I wanted to take her home., So I didn't eat properly, I didn't take my insulin properly, I made myself insulin resistant that this year just because my blood sugar was as high as a year, Eating only terrible food when I ate, So it really took a toll and I really got very sick, and I wonder well if I don't, if I had taken care of myself and had my head completely straight and my vision and thoughts were not complete, were not clouded, I would have made better decisions on her behalf, especially if she needed them., and when she needed me to step in and make the decisions for her because she, She had a health disaster because she had a kidney, and she had kidney damage that led to kidney failure., your health insurance provider misses that, So she ended up with, Such a kind of this whole thing, Disaster where everything began to break at once, She had a stroke like a fifties, which she had a small stroke., and it just went down from there, so I think well, if I hadn't, if I had taken care of a better care of myself, I would have been able to take better care of her, And I know, There was nothing I would have been able to prevent her death, but what if I had been able to make it easier for her, if I'd taken care of myself and that's like a great regret I've had, Oh, I know I'm <Laughter> but xxx it's, my desire to take responsibility, for everyone and everything that matters to me to take responsibility for my own life and me and mine and I know other people I can't really do, to direct them into my own vision because they are their own, Individuals, And they do not know, be what I want them to be and I know they won't be, But I still have you know my ideals, and I want the way that I want everything to go and I want everyone who is important to me to be happy and also to be able to, fits into my life, in a way in the best possible way, but I know because they are other beings, and I know I won't be able to do that for them, and they won't be able to do that for me, but it's still my ideals, so sometimes I have to look at it and go well, is what I want because I want it or what is what they want and what their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually their, And I know it's theirs, so if you really care about someone, you're just gonna support them and go with them, but..., It's still, kind of hard <Laughter> for me and I know I have to get through it, um, Ten or twenty years ago, probably to be in the beginning of my own life because I wound up around my mother I mean her, became sick literally the weekend I finished in college <Laughter> and I had a job set up and I had to pull out of it because she needed me to take care of her, And I think I would have been more aggressive if I had started my own life getting a job out there., the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like this built up instead of just completely her daughter for about ten years, so, I think I probably would have done that., But I'm telling myself that you keep who you are and learn to separate., you are who you are and what you have to do for your family, to keep a feeling of yourself that is probably what I would have done and do things for myself to keep that feeling of myself that is probably the supply of what I would give myself, Ten years ago <Laughter>, no, no, No, but probably because I didn't go to the doctor because I don't want to know., and I mean, it's not, I know there were times in my life when I was very depressed and it's usually circumstances., and had to pull me out of her, but I'd rather pull myself out of her before I resort to treatment., and it gets <ge>, um, After my mother died, I mean, it had been such a long fight for a year that we had lost and I didn't know it., If I was responsible for logically doing so, I knew it wasn't me., but, how could I convince myself, Two weeks after her death, I'm with, Pulmonary embolism, in one in each lung because I didn't look at myself for a year and I thought, oh I'm thirty years old when, You know what I'm doing to myself, I can't get over any Laughter, but..., I mean, I had to take more medication., because of the, It was a struggle to get my own health back to be able to, To get out of this depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden., the carpet was pulled out my like ground fell out of my world after that so, that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression around I was almost divorced because it was because I just didn't want anything anymore, so, and I was really away from my husband, until that time we were married for about two years at this point and I started very far away from him just pushing everything away just, You know what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life., and it, It's already, A fight you know, you mean there are times when I couldn't get up., Just stay in bed and sleep all day you know., but then, to recognize that:, When my mother died, I had four cats to watch for two, my two are her and so I adopted the two who were her, I mean good, They have no choice if they can buy their own food and buy their own food., I took the responsibility to do it for them., So that was a motivating factor that they had no choice whether I would get up or not and take care of them, I mean, I could go without eating, I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't, They didn't know., they actually have me up and, and let me go and face things, even if I didn't want to, not only didn't just want to somehow lure and die, but that wouldn't have been my choice and they I mean what would happen to them, If I wasn't there to take care of her, they'd be, You know sent to a shelter or whatever likely, and maybe they wouldn't have taken me back and adopted me from someone else, maybe they'd have been killed., for me I mean to make selfish decisions for me, So it's like I need someone to take care of me to get me out of bed <Laughter> and that was actually a motivating factor, because I found out that if it were just me, I would be able to live without a lot of stuff, I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted it not to be a big deal I don't care, as long as I did what I wanted to do with my life, but, I need to take care of a family., So I have to get out and do things, You know, I need to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day you know, day job I need to know you,, but I'm trying to find a balance between the two, because that's what I want to do with my life, but still I have to take care of my family, so I'm, Work on a balance between the two, very <Laughter> but it's worth it, I mean,, it would be very I would have much less things to worry about if I only lived in my car and said forget it <Laughter>, but keep, a residence below pay bills things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it, you know, if you want something <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through it, and I and I know that, but, it's gonna be hard sometimes you want to give up, but then, It's how good what the alternative is, I mean, I don't think I could live a pleasant life., Because if I did, I wouldn't do anything <Laughter> I have to be something uncomfortable or I won't do anything to myself I'll just be, Be happy to just stay in bed all day, hang out with my cats or whatever, and I wouldn't do anything, Very, Scary and nervous and I mean what if, I can't find it., enough you know enough work to pay my rent or whatever if..., You know what if I can't?, to keep, a similarity of stability in my life and it's actually hard work to be stable <Laughter> and I know it's hard work to be stable, but, What you know, it's just a lot of what ifs, and I don't think it's things that didn't happen and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that didn't happen and I know that, but it still happens <ha> it's still crawling in, So this is actually, a source for, Anxiety, but then try to let the fear go by doing things by finding out the things that make a solid plan and go after it., But I know it's a cycle, and I'll assume to be really scared and oh my God, what am I going to do, what am I going to do to say okay what is, the basic thing I have to take from here, I mean what <wha> what is only foreign and what can <c> what can what, is what are the actual non-problems and what is the real problem, And so, figure out how to do things this way and then the fear starts to disappear a little bit, but then something will pop up and what will pop up again, mm I have to, uh , Find out again <Laughter> but I know it's a cycle I know what seems huge on the surface when you start hacking it away, You get over it pretty fast, you get through., the last time I felt really happy, I don't know., zz, um, i , huh <Laughter> that's a good question that actually really <ac> that actually surprisingly dull me, because sometimes I feel happy sometimes not so much sometimes just kind of, in the middle, um, really how happy happy I don't know, I can't imagine when this happened., I don't know you don't know., I mean perceptions of other people, probably as someone who, Strangely enough, someone who is left behind and you know,, treats things as they come, but I don't see myself like this, In general, and it's a, probably that I can think on my feet and, I'm not afraid., Huss my ass away and do whatever I need to survive and do things, To do this., and I can make it creative and I try,, Search for balance, likely, Probably the best things about me <Laughter>, that I basically do what I want with my life, although it's not all easy it's not, um, You know, I'm not financially good or what it's still a lot more than many people can say about their lives because I have an aunt I really don't talk to, who and the reason I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable, I mean, she's got, a career that they, It's more like a job she fell into, Because my older aunt loves animals, but she didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog nurse., and she was really good at it she had a stable business for a long time, but her hands <ha> know that she began to get arthritis in her hands and, She had... my cousin's father..., stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business, and she retired early because she retired early between that and arthritis., she occupied my younger aunt, who was still a dog nurse, but she hates it, And it's like you're changing your life so much when you change your life., And the thing I'm most proud of is, Yeah, I'm not as financially good at what she is, but I do what I want with my life you know I can, being creative I can have creative people around me that I really like to talk to around me, People I really like in my life and, to be satisfied with, and I see a lot of people who don't, and it gives me a feeling of maybe a bloated feeling of complacency to be able to say I'm not so, and I actually do what I want, although there are victims I still basically do what I want with my life now, Thank you very much <Laughter>, All right., Thank you very much <Laughter>, Goodbye.",10

things about what I do and really get upset by what other people do is not really good, It's not good for me., Oh my temperament can be controlled I can control it pretty well, uh , I don't know that

my mind is in contact, with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world I feel pretty good, Yes, Up and down, you know?, up because I'm motivated to come out and start doing other things in life than just doing nothing at all, and then other times where you want to achieve something and you can't really do it because there are roadblocks in the way, but uh, I'm learning how to overcome these roadblocks., uh , good for example, uh looking to go to school and I had trouble getting uh enrolled in school, I talked to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me go online and do it, so I'm like okay it's good it's going to be done <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., Um, can you repeat that again, ma'am?, Oh, yes, I did., saw I had to be, Uh <sigh> I'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh, I noticed that by certain situations like you I talked about the anger situation it's as if I wasn't angry all the time, that's not me, so sometimes when I get angry, I need to figure out what causes all this, what causes me to get angry, and I have to take, Excuse me, ma'am., It's not hard at all, because all you have to do is take your time and think about everything you've been through, and take a close look at the situation and, uh..., and then go from there and find out what is what really bothers you, It is very rare, uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh get this kind of sleep, would be great, because I have recurring nightmares, so of an incident like this, <Sigh>, I think it's and I don't know what it's triggering, but I think it's and that's why I'm talking to someone or someone because I'm a veteran, at the uh v_a about the situation now, about the p_t_s_d at the moment, Excuse me, ma'am., uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares many problems many anger problems uh depression, I've noticed all this in me and uh, I started telling myself I needed help., And that's basically it, I just know, I just know that I was something not wrong with him something wasn't right with me, And if something's wrong with me, I have to take some time to look at myself well and ask myself if something's right, if something's right, then that's fine, if something's wrong, then you have to take care of it., And uh I just started looking for help down there yes, something yes, it's something, Because I can sit down and talk to the therapist., Well, I'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and tell them my situation, and we're usually going to go through the problem., and uh, I went to class to talk to my doctor, so it helps me a little., Yeah, that's good., It's a good thing., Excuse me, ma'am., no, No, not really., My best friend, She would describe me as a funny loving good person always there trying to help others uh, think more of others really than of myself, but if I know I have to do things for myself, I'll take care of it., So you know it, and they really look up to me, they have a lot more respect for me., Yes, they see something in me, they wish that they, Excuse me, ma'am., uh you can be a little more specific, Oh, all right., uh books crossword puzzle, Walk, That's it., I thought I did, but I don't think I regret anything because, that's what it is, this is the way it is to me, so I accept it and I move on, Because if I regret something in the past, then I'm wasting my time on it because it's gone, that's the past I have to move on, I have to live in the present so that I can be prepared for the future so that I can go into the future., Yeah, that's good., <sharp inhalation>, uh <sigh> more education uh, I am more direct and trusting in what I do, as I am today, so yes, that was what I was missing about twenty years ago, uh yes <ye> yes I had been a lot of positive people in my life, Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., yes some people would uh uh well consistent <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivating me, a certain goal to pursue and uh I thought that was pretty good because I really don't see that a lot, and uh, he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things, because all you do is make a choice, it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that the choice is still to be done on you for it, Excuse me, ma'am., Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., that I am able to really be motivated myself, and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things that I thought I couldn't, but it can be achieved, when I'm ready to put the will to do it, Oh wow huh, Oh really and you know what I really enjoyed, sat with my social worker and we talk about doing things in my life., and school was one of them uh, and just school was one of them and I liked it because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me, Yes and I thought that was a great thing as long as you're ready to do that, I'm ready to even go the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school, And yes, that and that and that get me going, Oh it's and I love it and uh that will be achieved, Thank you., Goodbye.",11

they deny that they have a problem and I'm proud that I really like, You know, a person who can see that I have a problem and I need help, but many of the people I know they're not on medication are untreated and..., they just don't want to get help and I'm glad to get help because I don't want to feel that way and I want to get help for the problem instead of doing that, Oh, God, there's a lot I regret yes there's a lot around, I regret that you know that drug abuse you know, but that's part of you know that p_t_s_d I regret about, many uh mistakes you know relationships things like that, I would have told myself., um, I guess the advice I would have given myself was:, trying to keep my mind more relaxed, I guess, Yeah, that's good., um, Well, I'm a very nice person and I always like to

of hard for me to relax, I mean, I'm trying to watch t_v, Um, and I'm reading, A lot..., That's probably about me reading that I sleep a lot <Laughter> I'm a little depressed, so to, Yeah, it's kind of xxx, like I said, it's really hard for me to relax, um , It's not that., I tend to think a lot, about the things that emphasize me, I've been through a lot of things, so..., I don't sleep very well at night, and when I fall asleep, I wake up all night, usually with some kind of anxiety attack., um , I dream a lot about the stuff that uh has, influenced me over the years., You usually know how I dream about something that stressed me out and then I wake up and my chest will hurt, um , or just I just can't sleep all night because I think I seem to be I don't know if I'm afraid to sleep, but I... <sigh>, I just don't know that I feel like this is a vulnerable place for me., Because of everything that happened to me., So, um..., so I sleep is just not really something I do well, um , tired, I'm..., I'm moody, I'm very sensitive, um , I'm just negative <ne> a negative person, Um, I'm really not., I'm like < l> judgment is not me either, I'm just not a nice person to be here, um , I'm trying to read a lot of time I'm trying to go out and force myself to do things, just to keep myself in touch, So I just sit around and stay on the fact that I can't sleep and I try to make myself as exhausted as possible, to run around and do things, so , It's difficult., I like a part of me that doesn't want to., I don't really want to go out and do things that I have to force myself to do when I have appointments., I make appointments to like for auditions or around, Also to do that, I tend to uh, only not, as in the last minute I will try to convince myself not to go <Laughter> but then I force myself anyway, Yes, I was diagnosed for two cases., To diagnose I was diagnosed <dia> about three years ago three and a half years ago, and then I was diagnosed again around August, um , The first time it was..., I just didn't sleep because I didn't sleep., and the uh just the stress <st> of incredible stress, um , and then the second time it was a xxx uh again I started sleeping with the not around and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me around, and I just couldn't stand it anymore, So I thought..., I became too gloomy I became like, don't think life was worth it and i i i that I just had to see someone before something escalated, Yeah, that's good., It was, i no <n> not, One of the reasons I went to New York was to try, Get out of my surroundings, um, and uh, and that seemed to help a lot, um , and out here I was just the advisors I just didn't really seem to help me much, Um, they're just..., they seemed to give me a lot of medication and I don't think that's what I needed, um , Yeah, so..., Yeah, that's good., <sigh>stressed uh uh lately I was really sad and I don't know why, um , But as I said, I tried to fight this by..., keep me busy, um , In fact,, I'm kind of, A few days ago, I was really really happy and I was really happy, But then I went back to, you know you're going back to the miserable feeling, so, um , Well, I realized, I got up in the morning, I really got a good night of sleep, and, I realized I was really happy., Because I've been through a lot in my life and I have someone in my life who really loves me and someone who's finally there for me, and uh, You know, he gives me what I need emotionally and I was just very grateful for the, and that made me really happy, um , Yeah, that's good., Thank you very much <Laughter>, Oh, God, what are you doing?, um , I've had so many years of just, just bad a lot bad, that it was there a long time ago, Since I'm proud of everything, I guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships I've been through, around my <m> a smaller person I guess would have, got rid of himself a long time ago, but even if I'm really depressed and feel dark and I just feel miserable about many things, There must be a silver lining., so , So, yeah, I mean, I think that's what I'm proud of., I'm still trying to be a good person to try not to be negative to other people, and, and truthfully and I still have to drive inside me, Yeah, that's good., So much..., My last marriage, Don't come out if I should have, um , and uh just, I regret a lot, <Sigh>, the situation that would have a red flag..., You know, some things just don't work., and, No matter how much you try, no matter how much you put in it., I'd tell myself to..., that it is not selfish, Let go of a bad situation, and not everyone can be helped, so sometimes you only have to live for yourself and help yourself, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ., had I known that then I had known that, then I would probably have done better in life, so , Yeah, that's good., <Sigh>, um, People who, when people fall on me because of my mistakes, That I've done that I have things I've done in my past that people are still alive when I'm trying to forgive myself., People who are mean to other people, uh, people who talk badly about people behind their backs, people who are untrustworthy, um, only anyone looking for the little guy, um , You know people who don't care about the environment or animals, um , I think everyone should be as good as possible., And it's discouraging and it just makes me so angry that people just can't be people who don't let people live, who try to make everyone feel as negative and as bad as they do, And uh i that makes me angry, <Laughter> I unraveled <Laughter>, Yeah, I tend to vent and then uh, And then it's usually over, I'm not trying to mouth bad people, I'm just trying to talk it through until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore, mm, I'm not trying to get angry, because I have a really bad temper, and it's, and it can be out of hand so around, what I do is i <laughter> something makes me so angry I tend to go and take a nap, To <Laughter> If I'm not in this situation where I can just take a nap, I usually just walk away from the situation and try to clean up my mind, and come back to him, um , It was a few days ago, it was actually with my mother, It was about, actually, she thought that I had taken a shirt from her, And around her cried out, and cried to me, and round about,, I was tired, I was late., I started screaming <a> back to her you know, because I was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty, and you <yo> <sigh>, It goes back to my past, you know, when I was younger and you know I didn't care that you knew people's things and I just kind of took and did what I wanted and I'm not that far from that person, It hurt me, so I got angry and I and I started screaming and fighting., mm kind of petty and stupid, but, at the time when it seemed, It seemed uh, Viable, um , hmm, one of my most memorable experiences, um , God, I've had so many..., Maybe, It was..., I don't know., um , It was, It's probably due to, Graduated from pharmacy school, I felt pretty great, I didn't know if I did., uh very good or not uh and I

that many of my friends say that they're looking to me for some of my accomplishments and, They also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because I am caring and compassionate, or, To

want to sound like that, but it's true, it's just about you having to learn how to feel and relax with you and just know not to compare yourself with other people, because what someone else does or where they may be in their lives at a certain time is not necessarily where you, You should be or what you should do at this time does not mean that you are less competent or less able to do it, it just means that everyone has their way and everyone has their way., their time and their development, as they get to things, I would say to myself ten years ago, only, believe in me and stay on my own

the world uh it was a mission trip so I just went and helped in different third countries it was really cool, uh I love to go to different places, see new places and meet all different types of people around, because it is easy to simply be included in your own little bubble that you forget that there is a huge world and there is, all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet these types of people and just see the, Diversity and the terrain of the earth also and the way the earth looks in different places is cool, No, I didn't serve in the military <Laughter>, Yes, No, I've never been formally diagnosed, although I'd say I've probably diagnosed myself with depression just after studying it a lot in psychology, during the years I've been, I'm probably ninety-nine percent sure I've struggled with depression from time to time, so yeah, lately it's been pretty easy, but over the years I've definitely had a lot of problems with insomnia around just like either not being able to fall asleep, or just as constantly waking up all night and so now I'm not really experiencing too much of it, but in the past it's definitely an ongoing topic for me, I'm not a pleasant person when I don't sleep well Sleep is extremely important to me I think maybe more than a lot of people I like need good sleep to work, I feel really good., In the last few months, I've been unemployed after I got out of here and, this was really tough around and I just offered my job around just like last week, so I definitely think I've gone through, a lot of crap and just a lot of depression, but it's like I've picked up a lot of it because I don't have that pressure anymore, how will I end up hitting this city really expensive and I don't have a job and, so I feel much more relieved than I had the feeling that's good <Laughter>, I mean, just like I said last week, or so I've become a lot more., Positive I was kind of like a feeling like a hermit in a way it's just hard to be like in a new city and not really know too many people and, Of course, as I said, not having a job leads to, Type of, like in your own bowl I think, and that was kind of like it was like it was like it was like for me and just since I got the job offered I just got so much more, Trust and like positivity that things start to train for me, which is good <Laughter>, Oh, it was probably a few days ago actually I was going around, I went to explore a part of the South Bay that I hadn't really been before and, it was I just wanted to go on a jogging along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and, It was just beautiful and then I went for a ride of this kind like cliff, where there is beautiful scenery that I've never seen before and I just, how overwhelmed was how beautiful it was and I was just like oh I can't believe I can live here, so that was definitely a happy moment for me <Laughter>, my best friend would probably say that I am very daring and, bold and fearless about, that I am unique, and artistic, and I wouldn't suspect that she would probably say that I'm a non-conformist, I don't really think the way many people do and I question everything that can be a good or bad thing, but yeah < laugh>, um , likely, Just like, the fact that I really try to live my life with no regrets and just try to make a very, exciting life in a way and I think that especially since I finished college and travel as I have and, I've tried to move all the different places from myself, so I just think the fact that I'm not really afraid that I'm not letting things hold back I just want something or if I want to do something, I can just do it and, I think in a way I like that about me and the fact that I'm really independent and can just go and do what I want, even though it's hard I'm still proud that I've overcome a lot of these fights, Oh, there's like little things I regret all my life, but there's nothing really important, because I think pretty much everything I've done, I've learned whether it's good or bad so, I wouldn't change anything., Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,, I'd say I'd tell myself when I was a kid that I, should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything someone says stop me from believing that anything is possible because, um, I guess when I grew up to be an adult, I really saw and started to believe that really everything is possible and if you really want something, you can go after it and you can get it, so I would just, Tell me never to give up and just always believe that you can do whatever you want., oh , Let's see, that's kind of tough <Laughter>, Um, I guess,, I recently went home for Christmas back to Oklahoma and to see some of my friends from college I hadn't seen in some of them I hadn't seen how since, I graduated so much as four years ago., It was really great, just going out with them and we went to dinner and we went out later and had only a good night and it was really really fun, Cool, You're welcome., See you.",10
353,"Yes, I'm fine., to pennsylvania, mhm, Well, I was in Boston a few years ago and then I moved here about three and a half years ago, but around I was just not satisfied with the quality of my life, To maybe once or twice last year I only returned once, one year, um, in any case safer and to definitely a, Well, I just miss it because I have a lot of family back there, but l_a is okay I mean everyone loves the climate here, um , not too easy I have two really good friends here and I have a friend with whom I've been together for three years so that helps him to be from here, but to make it definitely took a bit of adjustment, no, To promote communication, No, I'm actually working right now, I'm not working right now., I want to be an osteopathic doctor, So basically against Western medicine an osteopathic doctor is someone who, Helps someone with the symptoms and not only treats the symptoms, but treats them as an entire person, so they look at diet, diet exercise, just a variety of things to really get someone to live <t>, a healthier life versus drugs or things that are commonly prescribed in Western medicine today, Well, one of the big things was when I got out of here to be exposed to the degree I'd never heard of living on the east coast., Sometimes, Well, I'm very special about the people I like to surround myself with around and, I don't like being with many people, I mean, I like small intimate groups, and I don't like being in larger or larger groups., um, when people do not take into account other people's feelings, Usually, try to take a walk when I am very irritated, I'm usually really good, it really takes a lot of time for me to flood and scream or get upset., Let's see., uh mm, I was with my lawyer and it was about his treatment of my case., Yeah, it was him, uh, they're I don't know, I think they're just a little mediocre, they're not the best lawyers., I have no idea <Laughter>, I'm very trustworthy, I'm loyal., I am very interested so I like to try to help other people, Um, and I'm always trying to cheer people up, so I think that's a few of them., no, Yes, A few months ago about in the last six months, To me was, experience, mental problems that I never really came from paranoia and fear and I knew it wasn't, um, I knew it wasn't me that I couldn't get over it alone., much better I did a lot of yoga and meditation to somehow see things from a different perspective, or other <ano> not per <pe> per view, but a different view and around, This has helped, but there are definitely times when I return to thinking about the event especially because the event caused that I no longer work, um , I think I know I'm having trouble being in public. I'm still dealing with fear and paranoia., To such a lot of times during the day is when it happened, so I'm not so comfortable to go during the day I tend to go into the mornings and evenings, I don't like going to places where there's only one way in and one way out., um, Well, I've been trying gradually to raise how much I'm out there to, and I usually just deep breathing around I do a lot of breathing exercises and, I'm just trying to say that basically what I think or what's wrong with me is not real and that, I'm just trying <Laughter> I'm just trying to go into these places more gradually much better since uh the last few months, but before I stayed a lot pretty much at home, um , It was good to hear someone's feedback, but..., I have the feeling that I have got more help in my inner conversation, with just one kind of sitting with me and journaling, I know., To <sigh>, Well, I feel more like myself, which is a tremendous improvement around, and I'm more, Carefully and guarded in any way over my thoughts, um, and also about my decisions, I'm not like this, I'm not so oh you know I'm just gonna do this and I'm not really thinking about the consequences of other things I want in my life, It's gotten better I'm okay <ok> I'm better now around the first three months it was very difficult I couldn't sleep through the night and I woke up maybe two or three times and would be awake for a few hours, But now I'm sleeping through the night again, I feel like groggy <sigh>, I feel foggy and out of her, and little depressed, mm, It's..., I think it's been a while., um, Work <Laughter> I'm a bit of a workaholic around, Spending time with my family, um, Yes, just being outside, enjoying nature, Read, around very close, What's that?, um, Scrubbed_entry, um, Well, my parents, because they were always very supportive and loving., gives me feedback about my decisions or what I decide to do, but allows me to make my own decisions in life and then, my sisters were just getting very close to you know just always check with me I'm the baby I'm the youngest in the family so they're always around, looking for me and only with me and then my friend xxx with this incident that happened, He was very, Uh usually supportive with just let me talk and work my kind of things and understanding when I feel and don't want to go out in public and, and to be aware that it is not so easy for me to do something like a grocery store, or, To do errands without a lot of fear, I'm very proud of, the work I've done to the people I've helped., Maybe that I took this job where I was attacked at <Laughter>, that's it., go to retail in insecure environment, don't listen to my stomach, um , What advice would I give, what, uh, to, ruthlessly pursue your dreams, that it is not something like too late or runs out of time and, and to enjoy every moment of your life takes nothing but self-evident, um , Let's see., Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., cook well I really enjoy I enjoy cooking around, So I made a few roasted vegetables just every time I cook I just really enjoy it around we have a garden so, We had greens that came and around some chilies, and cauliflower so easy with preparation that, for <f>um, for my friend and i, mhm, Bye, thank you.",11

355,"Yes, All right., I was born in uh los angeles california, the weather; and, the fact that uh people aren't as intrusive as on the east coast, uh, only the uh traffic and the, the smoggy weather, I used to be unemployed, so I rarely go anywhere., i have a b_s in uh business with a uh computer uh, Option, I thought that the only place where I had a job with a business <bu> business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods, so I took that business computer methods option, Oh, I'd probably be like..., a professional sports player or an actor something you like to do, I like it uh, Cycling I like to see sporting events, now I can't afford to go to them, So I'm pretty much looking at t_v, I like to travel, but as I say, I don't have any money for it anymore., That's all right., People who are chicken heads get their noses in other people's business, even if they're just strangers you expect from a family member., or a friend, but you know, especially with the Internet that feeds a lot of it now we know what orwell related to when he spoke of great brother in nineteen-eighty four, I don't do much., much different than I usually do, Uh and I had lots of temper outbursts, uh , I fight with my aunt, and it was because it was basically, Making leading statements to lure me into a trap, to say something about a relative, And it made me very angry, I'm kind of on the road with my parents., I'm kind of the black sheep., Oh, I mean, my mom did the most to help me., She's done a lot., You know more than anyone else by far., Well, I mean, she's just, I remember a time when I went in like thirteen with a friend of mine to see the Crosby Stills Nash and young concert in the forum, And she has seven children, and she picked me up at the Sizzlers' place opposite the forum at eleven o'clock at night, and I couldn't imagine,, with everything she had to do the day she agreed to do, but she did., Oh probably uh, on the cape at the end of the peninsula uh baja there are Cabo san lucas, or take <ta> the photographing of the bridal wedge falls in Yosemit, Uh it was probably the two most majestic sights I've ever seen, It was when I could afford to travel, no, no, I was, Diagnosis with depression after a hospital visit in April of two thousand eleven, and uh I took a few lexapro but I stayed after a day I didn't want to do it anymore, no, because I didn't feel it was helpful, I feel that I was becoming a zombie, Yeah, that's good., depressed about not having a job for over two years I lost my job in October two thousand and ten and except for, Day you know jobs like this that I'm lucky, only you know daily things focus groups like that I haven't worked, Thank you., especially when you are fifty-six years old, Good mm, Uh just uh it just that I think the general feeling of hopelessness, I get a lot on my bike and go or drive only four hours a day divided about two hours, Yeah, well, to get something, very simple, Because now I'm old, when I was young, I couldn't sleep more than six < s> four six hours a night, Because I'm restless, no, But now that I'm old, I sleep much easier, I pray before I go to sleep, And that's when I don't have any trouble sleeping, I just pray, recite various prayers like the prayer of the Lord's hail Mary stuff so and I am able to fall to sleep, I don't know, probably uh, can't have specific memories, of that you know that it was when I had to spend money I know that and if I had to have a job to spend money, so it was probably, 15 years ago, All right., I didn't enjoy anything I did last week., made 75 dollars on a job with the county basically it was an emergency preparation exercise they ran for their staff and they recruited people to play, who are basically the relatives of people who are in a, Case uh bombing in the parenthesis center and we know that the asked questions signed you know that they give them the information I miss, You know relatives and basically it was provided by the county, and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a, not hard it was just uh, just a routine that we had to follow, we had to pretend that we were actually, lacked someone and had to give the peculiarities of their properties height weight etcetera, I don't have a best friend., uh , I'm very bright., I'm a, Perfectionist at my work, I'd say that's it., I got a business degree and I've never been a motivated person I went to school I went to, two state universities and two, I think that was probably the most important post < con> post that I made to my, You know about my self-esteem that you could say, so I had something to hang on the wall., Yeah, I'm sorry you know, Displace family members, I would have..., basically was not so impetuous and left thinking jobs < think> thinking that, You know, I could still get one and not you know it, I could probably work at one of the employers I've worked for the moment, They added places, but I burned bridges there, so that's not possible., Thank you., Hasta luego",10
356,"Yes, All right., from here anyway from Alhambra, the weather is really nice and everything is very familiar, Uh sometimes there's too much traffic jam on the roads too much traffic, I studied art and photography, It wasn't so much a decision that I kept noticing that I was very interested in it., Yes, I'm a photographer., mhm, oh, I suppose, uh, um, run a family portrait studio or any other type of photography business, uh no no no I'm also an apartment manager it keeps me tied, It's fair that it's not the best because it's an apartment manager., I have a free rent, but I have to stay., There's a lot, so , that part does the free rental part is very good, Oh, God!, my most memorable experience, That's hard to say, um , All right., I mean, there are good and bad unforgettable experiences, oh, Well, I guess some s s s s like sports success when I was in high school, there were some of the things I was happy about, and, some works of art I made were unforgettable, and, some bad things would be the death of my father, you know, but these are very memorable not good though, uh , Well, my parents and my I have a lot of brothers and sisters, uh so that my family, uh pretty close, but most of them live around l_a, There are a few who come from far <f>, away <di> uh away my brother lives in New York and, my other brother lives in maui <free throat>, mhm, Oh, mostly very talented, <ss> just to get more involved in the technology than maybe I was, or I am and they are about, I think they're more of a hive ghost than when I grew up, Looks like they're all entangled in social media., Go for a walk or, Watching TV, or play with my computer, and uh, Uh, good., There are some <so> some, uh , There's a kind of uh, Injustices That Do Not Happen, no big deals, but for example our parking situation deteriorated with some new District Parking, that's kind of disturbing and the city doesn't seem to want to, uh make any exceptions or change some rules, and also uh some unfair things sometimes happen at work, the riots are <ups>, Uh, who're annoying, - Nope., I worked for <f> at school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> I worked at a high school dance uh this past weekend and when we arrived at the site, people on the premises said we couldn't do all our gear and scenery and things in the place where we were assigned to do it, that we were going outside, and then get an OK to go in because we weren't prepared outside, nor even said in advance that we should be outside, It delayed our setup time and that wouldn't have bothered me, except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained., that we set up too late when they told us, to wait for them and we told them we would delay when we wait and we still have a complaint, so this part is annoying and, And our work doesn't support those in the office they need to please the school to keep the account., Uh often, when something like that happens, it means that they won't send you to work at this school again, which would translate into less pay hours for the photographers who were in this job, Yeah, that's how they do things., so that this is disturbing, Uh most of the time I dust from my resume <Laughter> and look for other situations that, this could be better, um , Yeah, that's good., Uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx, I could the moment I don't really lose it, but xxx later I could..., but right now I wouldn't do that, um, We have a tight schedule today and I have a friend with whom I share a car., We argued where to go first., And so we compromised and, has most of her stuff and one of my stuff then after, That was one of the things that are over, then we're gonna do more of their stuff., but it, Yeah, that's good., no, Post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what, uh, No I didn't, Yes, Oh, I'd say nineteen eighty, Yes, I think it was nineteen eighty., Yeah, that's good., um, Well, my father noticed some symptoms, my father is just good, he died, but he was a psychiatrist, um, Well, I wasn't sleeping, I was lying around the house, To wake me up at, At noon, something like that, and I didn't have a..., Focus like for a job it wasn't clear enough, I remember a few job interviews that I would go to her front door and then I wouldn't go into <Laughter> and I think that was all part of the depression, Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was., no, All right., I went for three years, and then the psychiatrist said,, He thought I was finished <laughter> but uh, and I and I came to a much better place that I have to watch all the time to see what's going on, with depression, so I think I'll have good and bad days, um, I think the therapy will let you see what..., as I thought it would be as a filter or with a pair of <pa> as if you weren't really looking for a depression pair of sunglasses, You see everything through this, so you have to somehow <k> I have to somehow, try to take out the glasses for a little and double check I'm really aware of these things exactly, or see it through a depressed view, and I'm trying to find clues about it, I think I'm..., A bit slip backwards uh uh i don't do well during the unemployed periods, I have noticed on my way in my past and around the moment we have a work slower, so it is easy to slip back into sleep too late or expose things because the schedule is too far open for, for me personally as a depressed person I think that structure is really important, It's..., It takes you out of bed and you have to go somewhere in time and, Deal interaction with people is all these are all useful things for someone who tends to be depressed, uh , Well, I don't know if it's changes, how I tend to be a little focused on some things that are, Probably not that uplifting we say uh, but it's rather negative like i, have had <ha> somehow thought about how to, um, Soldiers in the past uh I don't know why, but how the ancient Greeks during the Roman era or the Greeks would have been in a frontline fight with, mm, They know only raw <cru> type of raw <cru> in my opinion raw weapons and no medical help and, that I don't know, I seem to be going a lot where I'm thinking about it and I've seen it and read books about it or about video clips on youtube and, Eh things like this or, some other things <thi> other uh somehow like terrible doom type subjects as I watched on the animal show like crocodile attacks and such things, where should probably not be so much on that, Oh, you mean well in life in general, I think I'm sorry I didn't finish college, I think I was <wa>, Uh went into depression right then and wasn't coping very well in my last year, and to not really, I didn't come out of college with a degree even though I was there seven years, but uh, that's very that's a big regret that I've had, um , I think it would be..., at certain points I would probably have been looking for therapy and also probably some, Uh outside help only to get through the finals only the logistics, I had I was an art major and I didn't have a car like this, many of the art projects and things were hard to move back and forth and, and also to meet uh in distant places I think it would probably have been worth, do whatever was necessary to get a car at that time, so , um , I was told that I was very patient., and I also have some original artistic ideas, so , These are, these are good qualities, which I am very loyal and also, You know, I support my friends, I'm pretty generous with them., so, Yeah, that's good., Let's see., xxx really enjoyed

different cultures and ethnicities around, so it was a unique experience, The last time I was back, it was probably five years ago., um definately different uh my aunt she lives again uh she lives in a small town, So if you want to go to a movie theater, you have to drive at least an hour or if you want to go to a mall, it's an hour's drive, so it's the complete opposite of Los Angeles., around

this and that, so basically, I'm just..., When it comes, I won't deny it, or when it comes and when it is, when it feels like it's something I'm going to talk about, In fact,, My relaxation is up, I'm just around, living with my mother my mother and uh she's an elderly citizen and she's alone around what I do to relieve uh relaxation or stress is I actually help her to work yard, take care of all the gardening and such things and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know,, I'm not..., I'm not, It takes a lot to make me really angry as far as my temper is concerned., There's not much to it., um, I'm trying to think here, I can't remember the last time it was, but it was probably sometime last year when I had a creditor I was dealing with., very difficult to work with to, and I owed money as far as some medical expenses that had occurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago and uh, they weren't very understanding of the situation and I uh uh I was really a little upset about it because, I felt like I was being honest with them and I was more than willing to take care of my problems, but uh, they played hardball and I didn't care about it., It does <Laughter>, probably the toughest xxx decision I ever had to make was to, it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who fought against uh prostate cancer and, Yes uh a decision to make with my mother whether using a procedure that was either to help him, or there was an easy chance that it would help him even though he was pretty much at the end at this point, or it would kill him you know, And that was really hard, it was really hard to make decision, but uh uh you know, i, I felt like I wasn't trying to see if we could save his life <l> helping to save his life or if we weren't taking any chances and taking this extra step that I would regret in the long run, It's, It was, um, I'm separated from my wife, so she has her problems, I have my problems, but we're not divorced, we're just separated., And we still have a relationship in which we still talk, we just don't live together., And the relationship with my mother is really great, you know, she's very understanding I'm a single child so, She likes to have me what is good because she is eighty two years old in her late she at her later stage of her life, and, and so she must, I guess it's a good thing that fate may have happened in its own way, because you know anyway,, someone eighty-two years old alone in a huge house is not a good thing, but with me because I think she feels <fe> it's a comfort level she feels at me because especially her only child, Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things I did to hurt my marriage, Um, as far as..., the things I did the selfish things I did when I was much younger, which obviously influenced the relationship between me and my wife, Oh, yeah, I..., in a situation in which:, To make me work enormous amounts of hours under a lot of stress my wife also worked a lot of hours in a job that she had and uh we grow apart, And when she was gone, my form of release was, uh, going to the casinos and playing and so, You know, I spent a lot of time at the casinos, and what happened was that I spent a lot of money., and obviously this was an important topic in relation to our relationship, had to do with trust because to, It was devastating for my wife, I felt when it came to light, I felt very guilty, and I felt less than a person at this point in my life, No, not at all., No not really no, I have no problems sleeping, that's I can never remember having any problems, so no, no, Not at all, No, I'm good I just < deep breath> the only thing I could say is, after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I won't let the little details or little things in my life bother me the way I used to., so I tend to be a little easier and my friends and family have noticed that, the last time I felt really happy, um, Probably, if, I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack, and, he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that, He was glad to explain that there was no scar tissue., no larger scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart attack, and that I could count on a fairly normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medication, Well, I guess number one is uh, my physical being itself, I may be a little healthier to lose some more weight, um, just generally just be healthier physically, and as far as mental for just not, go back to those ways of thinking where I did the wrong things instead of the right things and not being so selfish, only one day at a time, You know I just..., try to be at peace with myself and try to have a little rest on a daily basis, I'm meditating, I'm reading, you know, I'm reading a few books, I'm watching to do things I know when I can, when I can help myself, I do things to help myself, Well, there's a lot I obviously regret in my marriage, uh my uh professional career, as far as I've had a long career with this majors uh food chain and, and I basically ended up ruining a very good career because of my gambling problems, but, um, at this point at the moment there's not much I can do, I can't change what has been done, so I don't focus too much on the past, I'm just looking at what's in front of me and just focusing on what's in front of me., what advice <Laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing, for yourself and you know, make the changes that need to be changed, You know I'm not., I'm not someone who's not intelligent, but I was smart enough to know what's right and..., Scrubbed_entry, You are what you do is wrong, you need to change your behavior immediately, likely, The proud thing I'm proud of is the fact that, I've done all these terrible things, but deep down, I don't think I'm a bad person as a person I need to remember., When I was trapped in all this gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had a disease, a compulsive, Uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me sick and that I was a sick person trying to get better, And every day what my life is about it is about recovery and uh, I'm just making sure I do the right things, from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night., One day at a time, It's not as hard as you think it is, but it's a process in which, You must be diligent about your behavior and routines, And just to know that what's not right for you, you know that it might be okay for other people to do certain things, but I can't do those things anymore., Most of my best friends can describe me as likely, Generous and generous, To be a nice person to be near, and, you know, They were obviously a little shocked when they found out about all my problems., uh in connection with gambling and the, mine and the separation from my marriage you know it's not over, you know., Well, my ideal weekend usually starts around, after having breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock, I'm going to a local park and it's about, This park is probably set up where you can go up a hill and down a hill it is about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning, um, my blood is flowing and my heart rate starts and then after that..., You know you're going home., Work in the yard a few hours, shower and relax and then, Just uh somehow step back for the rest of the day and then the next day I do the same in the morning again I go for a walk, Train in the yard, watch t_v whatever easy relax, so goes a weekend for me, and thank you, See you.",0
364,"I'm, I feel pretty good I'm far awake I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee, and I'm having a simple day today, so I'm just gonna chat with you, then I'm gonna go to the gym and do some errands, so I'm planning on having a nice day today., I was born and raised in los engles, and I'm one of the few locals from here, and I went away to school and uh, but I'm one of the few natives who are actually in Los Angeles, Yes, I am., I like the weather, owned by a holiday home in another state, that I found too hot and humid in florida I love the weather here, I like culture, I like diversity, I like the familiarity, I like the beaches, Uh but I also like that only an hour and a half away you can go into the desert say palm springs palm desert, but also an hour and a half away you can go to arrowhead or big bears and go snowboarding or skiing or things like the, and I think it's a great place to live, Thank you., All right., more of some perhaps some of the, Things I don't like about l_a or say California in general, say how the high tax rate, which is the state tax rate up to 13 point something now, which the business here will also banish the regulations, I'm a little entrepreneur, so all regulations are clearly impacting on the business so many of my colleagues have their business according to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other Western states that are less regulated, and that's a big problem here in uh, uh california, It really does most people don't understand, but it's uh, whether or not in the form of tubes, pipes or pipes, You know, besides high taxes, you know that there's a big immigration problem that's born and raised here, most people don't., But it's a big tax on the social system., and that makes our taxes, Uh so high until they really secure the borders and take care of it, So this is, You know, but people don't really seem to want to deal with it, um, but it's clearly affecting companies because of all the other things that our taxes are so high and people are moving out of the state., I enjoy traveling I was in sixty-six countries, and uh, I don't travel as much as I used to., But I've already traveled a little bit., and I learned a few languages and uh, I served it., I'm sorry., uh, I didn't really understand your question., When you said what I think you didn't understand what I said, but I'm just gonna go back and, I was all over Europe east of Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, around and I enjoy this and enjoy warm climate now especially where you can go and relax and there is warm water for surfing, Because the cold water makes my back stiff, and I also like to train and surf and do yoga, and train and uh, I'm trying to eat healthy and uh, It's a big part of my life., oh, safe, to one of my favorite trips of all time I was used to seeing when I was younger how many countries I could do in a relatively short period of time say in a period of three or four weeks, but about ten years ago we actually went to Paris and stayed about a week and really got to know the city, although I had been there about ten times., we got to know the city really well, which was really great, lived like a local, and rented a small apartment and, cooked and has our own shopping, but really, so often I have never stayed there longer than three or four days, it has been fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city, and it was fun, even if I grew up in l_a and read French, There was no large Spanish-speaking population when I was younger, my mother insisted that we all have children, take French, although Spanish would have been much more valuable, but I took French uh, all by uh elementary junior high and uh high school, so it was nice to practice my French even though I don't remember a lot and even though I stopped speaking French, with the French, You know, and my accent isn't the biggest, so after a few sentences, they start talking to me in English., <Laughter> so it was a, uh, I've got a few different degrees, So uh I was a Marine Science Major as an undergraduate, and uh, That was fun., and I also have a master, Uh Degree in Economics, and I have a degree in crisis management, so, I found her., interesting, and uh, It was something I wanted to do, where I went to college I went to the Marine Academy to play sports, and I found it very interesting to go to school in Maryland from Southern California, and I originally wanted to be a doctor, but, when you start going to school, for a little change your mind, etcetera so, I'm in the wholesale trade now., for wholesalers of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago, well you know my grandfather and recently father died so I kind of run an eighty-year-old family business, and it's, pretty interesting, I like it that it grew up around her, but it's different from other jobs I've had in the past, hm, actually probably my dream job I think cooking and staying at home this fun I have changed so much I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and uh, uh, I would probably like to stay home and raise children because I have a daughter, and uh, You know she couldn't spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have wished., but I think I'd be better than saying a lot of women I know I really want to work I really like to cook and hang out in the house and take care of children, You know I like it, I'm always part-time, but do that with pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy who would be fun to stay home and uh do that with pretty much worked most of my life, so, probably never happen, but it sounds like something I'd enjoy, uh i think i'm around generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I meet someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert., While most strangers think I'm introverted, but I think I'm when I feel comfortable with certain people and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be completely confident or people I've known for years either from a personal or a business situation, and be more, introverted, I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outer manifestation is a little shyer in general and reserved <reser> I use the term reserved, Oh wow, that's a great idea I had that on uh, one of my I have uh several computers at home, And that was one of my screensavers., I usually tend when I relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or go for a long walk or go for a long walk or go for a long walk I usually find exercise whether it is yoga or go for a long walk or go to the gym or go for a walk or go to the beach, maybe surf when the weather is warm I don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes, it gives me like a brain freezes, although I surfed for you know over thirty years, I had, It's..., I usually find exercise helps me to relax the best, or sometimes just on the couch in front of the t_v I find very relaxing <Laughter>, But I like this screensaver I had at home on one of my screensavers, but, Yeah, that was uh, That's it, but..., this is one of the things that took me a number of years to master even though my relaxation skills were, I probably didn't have the best in my twenties, but over the years, I think I've gotten better., at the, I think this is an important thing and I think as we mature, how we learn how to do that I wish I'd learned how to do that and, be a little more, How did you have the skills before, I think I'm pretty good I think I'm much better than how I've aged, um, You know, i, I'll think before I speak now, While saying twenty years ago I was more likely to act before I fought, So I could have said more things that I, in any tense situation, whether it is personal or, a work situation, um, but I have never had a violent temper, but I have a temper where I fly away from the handle instead of taking a deep breath and thinking about it., I think I'm much better at it now than I said in my teens or twenties., So if I think a lot of it comes from, I think the keyword is maturity, Oh wow, You know, I haven't really been arguing with anyone in a couple of years, which is what I used to do as a traditional, Argument to, likely, um, My ex wife a few years ago we had a argument essentially just about my daughter, and it was nothing violent, but it was only heated, basically one of the reasons why we were not married our values were so different just our ideas of education, and uh just, I think that caused such a different view of life., But I don't know if I'd call it an argument., but it was more of just one of them let us agree to disagree, Back of head, so, I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more angry at me that I had, earlier in life learned that the boy that before you have married someone children with them, is the kind of discussion that people should, Usually have, but you don't really think about it because, Sometimes when we're younger, we're, Look at boys, how does it look that I was great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me, But you know, I'm pretty easy to walk and I've got, different, Ideas about raising children as they did, and that was more, not that she was wrong and I wasn't right that I was right and she was wrong, it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really, about these things discussed, but it was really just basic, Reasons why we butted heads and more were not really a good match, Considering that other things looked good, You know on paper for both of us, hm, There's one that my father recently passed away., Thank you., and, really because in our religion you know that you are planning a funeral very quickly you know usually within a few days, and I have really only invited very close friends and family members, I was more or less responsible for my father being remarried, but his widow was somehow, not really up to him, so I took care of it and I wish I had invited one, I kept it very private and really just said the people after the fact, that he would have known that if they had known, he would have liked to go to the ministry., about it so I really only invited because only the time pressure really only a handful of people, but, Now that time has passed, I wish I had invited you., more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, You know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and I really just..., and even distant family members that I really only told after the fact that I really didn't invite them because, I was under time pressure, but I could have just done it by e-mail, or it's hard to call anyone personally, but, I wish that was something because people said something., They were mad at me when my other family members threw everything back at me, oh you didn't tell me until after the fact that, You know that and so it was over, so they threw it at me because I was more or less, to do it, so I wish I had done it differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really, angry at myself about something that I probably should have been better prepared for something < s something that came was inevitable so, Well, my two parents have been here lately, Died in the last few years, And I had a brother whom I had three younger brothers, one of whom died., in December, and, we are not super close as I always look at other families, We were just never so Norman Rockwell Uh Painting, I guess we're different, too., and uh, I have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family, not that it's weird, but I wish it was more like a boy from one of those families that came together every Sunday and had dinner and all that, we just, We never did that because we all, All so uh, uh different, Yeah, it's just being, but..., You know strangers and most people, I just say that you know how the family everyone is great you know, But I think every family has its own kind of, Goods, No, but I thought I could have had it before., some other events in my life and I was just not sure that I was going to have a therapy in the past just out, You know, I was in the military, and I was never really sure that was exactly what it was., but I think I'm working, pretty good, but I wasn't sure that I had been to therapy and counseling over the years., I didn't sign up as an officer., I went to one of the service academies, the, I started at seventeen when I was in high school., and I went to a service academy, So it's more prestige it's just not, it's the hard place where I went it's the hardest school in America to get in, I was as old as everyone else who went there., We did it., Eighty-three, um, just was basically nothing intense it was just we were just around some we were just, We were not allowed to carry ammunition, we were just our position, were only shot at., at the moment, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so, That was a, It wasn't too much., too intense it was much you know because it was the service I was in training much more intense than any actual combat situation, That's because they train you well, it's like practicing harder than you play, when you're an athlete, when you play football, you practice harder than you do., You actually play in the game and the same with uh, You know if you're in the fight., Unit, well it made me become patriotic grown up, in California, Whereas people from all over the country:, and I have to meet while most say my friends who grew up in wealthy loose angels as I did, never really went and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds and i, at the end always uh, only patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country, while in Southern California you really don't grow up with it, while someone in texas or Kentucky or tennessee or, georgia north dakota south dakota montana, grows up with this kind of uh, Pride, so I thought it was good and it, unlike so many of my friends who, You don't know there's a life between Malibu and Manhattan., I graduated, I was still in reserves, but I went to graduate school., and I have two graduates, and I went to work in the private company, uh, I didn't care., then I stepped into the fire department I was a fireman and paramedic, for a number of years; and, then, after I got divorced, it was more difficult to deal with the custody situation with my daughter, so I went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell, um, At first it was because I had such an attitude in my butt, of the way I went, I spoke, and again I was an officer, You were very regiment on the way you were dressed in your private time it was harder taking me a while, in order to be able to get back to loose narrowes, uh, Because it was just so uh, so different I think I have it better than most I have a stronger personality, So, but..., it was a great experience, um, it all depends on whether I do sports regularly and I don't eat too late, and things are going well in my life I generally sleep pretty well, Even though I may have to get up and go to the bathroom once a night..., but I sleep in general uh, I sleep pretty well in general, I've been feeling pretty good lately, You know, I was like any other more periods of blue in your life, but, Boy in the last few months I feel pretty big, No, not really., I seem I think I seem a little happier more content lately, I thought maybe in the past, because I have a family history of it., and, you know, It wasn't, everything really to weaken, and I couldn't really work, on my own, but I was busy looking for advice, I did I was really against it in the past, and until after I left, I mean, I wish I was going to say more during my uh, my marriage over the course of my life now I think it's very useful, but in the past, I was one of those I grew up and heard it was just ridiculous., and it was a waste of money etcetera, but I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it, Oh just a few questions I just wanted to know an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you,, Life relations, and sometimes it's good to speak things out with a, a professional, even if I wouldn't see someone like you in real life, I prefer someone older than I am a little more life experience than someone who might be younger, So, but yes, I think it's a useful tool and, I really have a hundred and eighty-degree switch on that, I'm not going now, I'm taking a break, but I'm not against having a few problems I want to bounce off., I have someone I'm going to, Yeah, that's good., I think it's nice., you know that she really, when you go to someone who is good and again I've been to some different people and bought some kind of therapist, They really don't tell you what to think, what I think is great., always in the past they just help you talk through your, Your thoughts, and your feelings and let you decide, but bring a little clarity, to the situation, so I like, To talk to someone who has much more life experience, and I'm generally more comfortable talking to a woman about this stuff than telling a man, Well, but it's, um, I think it's a useful tool I have some good ideas and, was able to talk to some things from totally someone who is unbiased and not in your everyday life, instead of having a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you, but sometimes the people of strangers hop is good, This morning., I know that's weird, but I'm clearly someone and I'd say that as a joke to my friends and, Family and staff I have clearly I have a simple day today because I knew we have nice weather, and I have a number of errands to run, and I clearly have seasonal affective disorder, but I woke up so happy today when I know it will be eighty degrees out, and when the weather is nice, I am usually much happier than when the weather [Laughter] is dark and blue and rainy and cold, where I always know that the term so, but I'm just good I woke up very happy today because I knew it would be a nice day, And I was looking forward to the sun, so, Most of my friends I'm a kind of renaissance man I know a little about a lot of topics, I'm too smart for my own good., And I'm a, I know a lot of permeable things I'm pretty rational, I'm very resourceful, People always call me when they have problems, and I help to speak them through them, or I am resourceful and tell them where to go, whether it's where you buy a new computer or buy a new car, or, You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses., uh, and uh, You know, people say I'm a lot of fun, too., I'm amusing to be with you, and, I also have I don't have many gray areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white, I am what I am, I'm not b_s, you know, I am the opposite of a politician., So I'm not telling people what they want to hear, I'm not rude to anyone, but I'm pretty much calling things as I see them., So that's pretty much, No, not really, because I do everything tactfully, I like to think I'm doing it, uh, I probably spent more time with my parents before they died, but I was busy, uh, I wish I could spend more time with my daughter when she was younger., uh, but only a lot of it is very typical, really think things through a little more, be a little less impulsive, or pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now, I think that's it and I'd look at things in the long run instead of looking at them., in the short term you know when you make decisions or decisions, I'm proud of my daughter., a nice young lady I'm uh, proud of my public service, I've never really got a job for my money, Military and fire service, There are very few people like me who did it., who are, had the background in the education I did, but I like public service, and, So I'm proud that, proud of all the certificates I hang on my walls at home and degrees, Type of trophies, I am proud that I have been able to stay in good physical condition over the years and, Knock wood get good health, It was nice to meet you., Goodbye, thank you.",0
365,"safe, I'm fine., new jersey, Yes, Three months ago, not very often, It's a lot different., uh, I don't know, it's just <Laughter> it's a lot more crowded here, to start a new life for me, It wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh, It was..., It was pretty hard at first, but I'm still trying to get used to life here., I met some good friends here., um, You know, I love the Hollywood area around, And only you know the mountains are beautiful, they're kind of things I love, hmm, Transport, not really no I don't, just didn't have the time or the finances to, digital media, All right., I've always loved you., < deep breath> computer and you know to design things and uh I don't know that I somehow fell into it, no, I got out., Well, I guess my dream job would work in something that, Uh I went to school for you know I've never really completed my education, um, But I guess it would be great if I went, you know it back to school, and you know, ready you know my, Completion in digital media, And you know I'm done., and uh started working you know something to do in this area, a little of both you know that sometimes I can be shy, but, I like to push myself to leave me, you know it's a fight for me, but, I don't want you to know it in a shell, so I kind of force myself to be out, I hear music sometimes I just drive and around, You know, playing music in my car and that helps me relax, or I smoke a cigarette, oh like what oh um <Laughter>, Just heavy metal, that's all I hear is metal., Good <sigh>, It's all about it., how high my stress level is and how angry I am, but i, I'm doing my best to, not so pissed on <Laughter>, Scrubbed_entry, and, I don't know if she's..., She wanted me to pick her up., She was a little drunk., and uh we somehow fought over the phone all over some other things and, I just didn't pick her up., because of her attitude on the phone with me, Yeah, that's good., it shall:, something I feel guilty about is not talking to my children, common, or as often as I should, I was just so busy trying to, I don't really have time to find my way around here., You know I talk to my kids as much as I want., you have no idea, um, It comes naturally, but it's not easy, and it's the hardest job I love to do, but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away, and I made this choice to come here, And I feel bad that I don't see them you know, but, The reason I got out of here was to improve myself so I could take care of her., Anxiety, you know, Fear <f> Only fear you will know that you are afraid of what will happen to your children you fear, the, Something terrible is going to happen, and, they do not see, brings forth this fear much more, You know, and I can't always be there with them, I can't see them, you know, It wasn't that bad when I lived in Florida., um, and I at least saw her, It wasn't very often, but I used to see her, now I don't see her at all, and, That's the hardest thing I've had., Doing as a Parent, is, Get away from my kids if I just don't know for a while how long I'll be here., I don't know what my future will bring, but, The hardest part is,, So far away from them, only the joy they bring me, I mean, I could have a bad day, And they're just firing me up, I mean,, i eh, It's annoying to be away from them for so long, and they're so far away, and do not see their faces,, It's the worst thing you've ever known., but, i, I love to see their faces that just bring a smile to my face, and, I don't know., Well, um..., I think, the fact that I can, up to their level, um, I'm a little silly <laughter>, as a father, when my father was with me, my father was, You know, strictly safe all the time that he knows you, laugh and play with us, but, You know he was always very reserved., you know, and he held a lot, he held a lot of his emotions just because, You know he was a strong, very tough guy., um, but with me I am very silly and stupid with my children and I am strict when I have to be, but, I always love it, You know you're playing around with them., as much as possible, you don't know, I don't want them growing up too fast., and that this may, Yeah, that's good., Good <sigh>, a situation I wish I had treated differently, There are so many <Laughter>, uh, I guess when I was still with my ex-wife, in florida, I wish I hadn't, got so angry or I wish I hadn't let her get the best out of my emotions, She had a tendency to, go under my skin, And you know it, Pick me until I'm ready., I exploded., and, I allowed her to do that., You know, I just would've, left when I could, And you know I can't get the best of myself., no, no, no, Sometimes it's hard., um, sometimes I just lay awake in bed you know, thinking all the things going through my mind all you know, all the stress that I'm going through, with work and you know, ensure that:, You know, I wonder if I'll be able to give you the rent?, You know what my kids are going through?, Do you know when I'll see her again if she even takes care of me?, when they know they have a father, you know, these are some of the things that run through my mind and, And that sometimes stops me at night, a little <sigh> but <sigh>, You know I got into this situation., You know I have to, You know I have to take it., You know that you reap what you sow, so i <sigh>, I have to deal with this my way., lately, um, I tried to, Don't think so much about, You know everything that goes into my life, I'm trying to distract myself, and this kind of, get me in a better mood, you know if I'm hanging out with friends or, Look at something to get me distracted by you., all the burdens in my life, um, the last time I felt really happy, uh, was actually a few nights ago I went drinking around, with some of my friends from work and around, I don't know., We just..., pretty drunk and simple <Laughter>, That kind of helped me forget, All the crap that was there., before went through my head, So if I can distract myself, if I can forget all this, Other material, then I am happy <sigh>, some of my best qualities I think I'm convinced <Laughter>, um, I'm kind of like a, I guess you'd say a consultant to some people you know some of my close friends, you know, I like to persuade people to do things they can regret, or I mean, I'm sorry to talk to people about things they might regret in the end., or I can, You know you only listen to people so you know., I could say that you know that I definitely know you're listening to my friends and helping them in their time of need when they're going through something., Scary times like I'm going through, Scrubbed_entry, uh who lives in florida, You know I talk to him every once in a while and, He's having trouble with his girlfriend and, You know I'm just kind of, To talk to him about his problems and listen to me mostly <mo> I hear mainly because you know that I don't think he has anyone else to listen to., Do you know when I was living in Florida?, I was very close to him so you know he always relied on me., and now that I'm here in l_a, I don't want to lose you knowing the connection to him, because I mean, I've always been there for him, so..., He... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he..., he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him advice, You know what I think you know he should., um, So I think, <th> I think he appreciates that and I and I'm glad he knows you rely on me for that, He trusts me enough to tell me all this., I don't know., Sometimes I wish I wasn't like that, kind or generous, it seems bad, but sometimes I don't know that people can take advantage of me, and I can't see it, and, I don't like to say no to people I like, People always to please, So if I can change that maybe I wish I hadn't fallen such a people, sometimes financially in difficulty <Laughter> <low breath> sometimes I know, you know, help others and don't know you, that can break me sometimes yes I can not have enough to, Paying invoices, but, I feel better to help people, I don't know., I regret, not, Breaking up with my ex-wife earlier, I regret <re> I regret <re>, Because she's been through so much crap in my life, and, I've always tried, Be a people I like, I tried to please her., You know, try,, Please my children as much as I can, by not dissolving, you know the family, but, You know, there's only so much a person can take., and I probably think if I left earlier, I could have been happier, and things may not have gotten as out of control as they have done., you know, during all the years with her, so, Maybe if I got out early., I don't know that I would have been happier, I guess., um, It's okay to be selfish., It's okay., you know, Sometimes think of yourself, you know when you keep putting everyone in front of you, then you don't think about yourself, you don't think about what makes you happy, and even if, Falling People May Make You Happy, Uh you sometimes have to think about yourself and your needs, because, you know, They play an important role, in, the life of your close family members, and, to keep everything above water, Sometimes you have to worry about the one person who, You know you juggle everything and stop everything you're yourself., Be a little selfish sometimes it's okay, I don't even know what a weekend is anymore., my ideal weekend would be, Alone locked up in my room, Watching movies that only listen to music, with my, Turn off mobile phone and, you don't know you're with someone or it could be at a bar, You know or know you see a metal show, so, I like being alone, But sometimes I want to go out with others, as you know I'm with people., Crazy <Laughter>, He thinks I'm..., I'm crazy because I got out of here., but, I guess he'd say I'm committed and I'm strong-minded, And that you know what I imagined, I can do it, you know it, no matter what., How hard it is that I won't freak out, so, I mean, I really respect him for giving me his insight., But I guess, yeah, I guess he'd say that I, crazy, but, Strong-minded <Laughter>, my children <sigh>, You know, this is the one thing that brings me joy that you know as real joy., are my children and, You know, having her in my life is the, The proudest thing I can ever achieve is that you know that she's, in my life, and even though I don't see her so much, Even though I'm thinking of them, they're just thinking of you., How far they've gone, you know, what they have achieved in their you know, in her short time I mean anyway it makes me happy, And I can't wait to see her again, one of my most memorable experiences, I guess that would be, Scrubbed_entry, in florida, You know to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch, It was a great night overall you know, one of the night I'll never forget, just because we were looking forward to you knowing so many months and, You know, when it finally happened, it was surreal., um, it was a great night after all and overall, sure that you are welcome, See you.",12
366,"Yeah, that's good., I'm fine., and you, Uh los close california, Uh <sigh> I like the variety, I feel that l_a alone is a country where there is so much to do to explore, And there is nothing like that., Traffic <Laughter> I'd say traffic and property prices are kind of crazy compared to the rest of the country, But unlike that, you know it's okay., I've traveled around I've traveled a bit, I'd like to travel more, but I've travelled to a few countries., I've been with you before., I will not say that Europe is a continent, I was in London, I was born here, but my family is from Nigeria, so I was in Nigeria., a few times I was in Denmark, um amsterdam, I was where else I went., um, and I think that's it, I think that's it yeah think that's it, Yeah, that's good., simply explore uh explore <exp> discover new places to see new things that meet new people a different culture, It's definitely..., um, gives you appreciation for life, and the diversity of it and also go to countries that may not, how developed, how the u_s it definitely gives you a greater appreciation for you know this country, Yeah, that's good., Okay well, uh, see london I accident actually when I first heard that I was going to london, I wasn't really interested because I didn't know much about it, the only thing I remember I remember, Sees Mary Poppins <Laughter> and around, But when I went there, I absolutely fell in love with him, just breathe., it still has the hectic pace of l_a, but at the same time you can drive at a very slow pace around we have no we just, went on the tube, It's her way like the subway station I totally fell in love with., and, just to explore different parts of the city we went to know you large Ben Westminster Abbey, In fact, when I went there, they had the premiere of, uh, what a movie that was., Slumdog Millionaire, and they also had the premiere for, seven seven pounds it was a movie with Will Schmied, They did it so that the blacksmith was over there, and we knew it., Me and my friends were like screaming like we were like groupies <Laughter> just you know, just knowing <Laughter> just for antiques, but, um, it was a lot of fun it was a lot of fun, Yeah, that's good., uh business management and an option in personnel management, which means I have no idea <Laughter>, um, Good question, I've always been, I've always wanted to go to business., and I've always wanted to study finance, but, I didn't think I'd learn too much about finance., college per se I think I've learned more in the real world, which is not, So the other option was Human Resource and I'm always fascinated that you know relationships and people always like to read articles about the stuff, so I went for the, No <Laughter> Well, I still kind of use what I've learned, but I work in real estate management, So, um..., It still has to do with people who have to do with people I'm fascinated by., so, Yeah, that's good., That was a good..., my dream job wow, I'd say I'm a life coach., I would say that would be my dream job, because I love helping people to succeed and I help, I love it, part of someone else's success even not, no matter how small it is, Whether it's words of encouragement or helping someone to find a situation, I like to help just how to help people have a better life, so I think uh, You know, but I'm doing it for free, I'd do it for free, like all day, Yeah, that's good., Yeah, that's good., more outgoing, In any case more outgoing I'm usually around, life is good it's strange because I'm usually considered the life of the party, I'm the one who cracks jokes and makes everyone laugh at the same time, I can be very, quiet and for me, so, Yeah, that's good., Right, <sigh> to relax, I usually listen to music, I usually listen to music to relax or i, Pray, to relax or listen to some really quiet music, so, Yeah, that's good., Very good, very very good I used to uh, I wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but I was known for it., Go off quote on quote <Laughter> not in one not in one you know, don't throw chairs or something, but, I'm a very patient person., but once this patience <patien> is gone and for you to do that you really really really really need to press my buttons for a long time and when it's finished i, I'm just going away., Not mm mm, no, The last time I had a fight with someone I haven't had a fight with in a long time., To <sigh>, Boy, mm, Uh I argued with my, no, I'd say my father had a fight with him., um, about <sigh> xxx what was it about, um, We disagreed on some things when we wanted to go back to Nigeria., and, He didn't listen., It was a kind of group discussion, me and my siblings., and he was very subjective he was not open to other people suggestions and suggestions and concerns, So around it started an argument, Very, uh, I wouldn't say angry at myself, but I felt very, It's like I lost control., I'm the guy where I like to have and feel control over my emotions and thoughts, As soon as this patience is gone and I start to run away, it's kind of like, This..., you know, I won't call it blurry, but, I'm very funny and fast with what I say so, I'll say something you know right away, until not necessarily hurting, but to very directly and to the point and I make sure that my point over, Yeah, that's good., around I have three brothers one one younger two older I am very close to my family and my mother is one of my best friends, To <sigh>, My brothers are great around, Love her to death, oh my father anyway he's more like that from the picture, Yeah, that's good., I'm not really the culprit <Laughter> I don't feel, Guilty I am not to shy away from what I have done and I definitely own up to what I do, I am not a shy away from responsibility, but I don't think I'll ever feel, Guilty, for everything I do, Yeah, I don't think I feel like I don't usually feel guilty., Yeah, that's good., Pretty simple, To be fairly simple at <a> at <a>, Yes, I'm pretty good at falling asleep except when I'm excited and when I read < laughter>, when I try when I'm, when I'm focused on something like learning, I'm going to read and read and read, Even when it's past my bed, But now I'm trying to work on, Wake up much earlier, then when I am now and this is kind of a fight <st> a bit of a fight, but I come to him so, Good, um, I have the feeling I feel good, you know I'm generally I have a very happy disposition, And so, no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever I feel like I'm going, I won't allow myself to go to this place., nah, no, I'm sorry., Thoughts, I'd say, Well, it's I wouldn't say necessarily changes, but I would say moreso behaviors learn how to, Let go of the past decisions, Maybe and somehow how they played their course in my life, um, I just look back sometimes and say what if I had done what, How would life be now, no, So these are some games I play, but different from the, That's it., hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter>, Regret, uh, no, no mm mm there is nothing I regret, Ten to twenty years ago, I'd say you're not afraid of who you are, to be authentic, um, even more important with yourself, Delete from my memory, uh, Boy, that's a good one., hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm, uh, Wow, Delete from my memory, uh, I'd say when I told my father to behave like a father., Maybe I shouldn't, Yeah, there was..., That was actually one of the times I used to go around with him another time, uh, Basically I had decided not to go to a private to not go away for college, So I decided to stay here so I could take care of my little brother., and around my senior year I was overloaded with everything I had maybe like, uh four a_p classes, I worked at I worked three jobs at that time and I was also in track and field, so, Needless to say, I was <Laughter> i i i i was kind of like burning myself, I was kind of like burning myself out., and, I was not good at a_p calculus because I decided to go to a j_c first and also transfer to save money for college, And when I told him that you know the teacher said I was going to fall asleep in class just because I was working an eight-hour shift after school because I was a retail manager back then., So, um..., and I would come home after the shift to do homework mm calculus let alone, Uhm so uh, He would get upset and I told him that I talked to my advisor, I already told him that I don't need this course to go to J_C, is not something I'm going on with, so I just can't get off., at this point in time, so I'll just know,, You just know it, Take the, d or fail whatever, And he didn't like it because he's a teacher <Laughter> I think maybe that's where it might have come from., And so, he started blaming like my jobs and wanted to call my boss and it was just too much and I told him, You know, since you're my father, you should act like that., but I was it was a more aggressive <laughter> as I said it so, That was..., One thing, oh I really do I remember I regret one thing, And that's, I wish I'd keep going., To go with college in the whole, As if I burned myself out to spread myself too thin, I was actually on the right track to graduate from college., I'd like to say nineteen, Because I started doing college classes in the high school early Sophomore year, in high school, but I was working with this stuff and stuff with my dad and I kind of stopped working to school for a while and just worked, but I went back to finish so I wish I just had, Continuation maybe that's a small thing, but, That's a little thing., Yeah, that's good., hmm, I'm very, I am a very compassionate and understanding person, um, I like to learn new things around I'm a very happy person People come to me for advice I'm very objective, I'll tell you what's good, what's bad, what's ugly., and, Yes, these are some of my best qualities yeah, and I'm fun I like to have fun I'm going to have fun in any situation I can make light out of any situation as I'm the type of person I can break the tension in space, the type of, this type of uh <tisk> around, Personality, Yeah, that's good., I wish I was bigger <Laughter> around, Except my size, hmm, I wish,, ah, Maybe, I don't know if it's uh., be more, I won't say more in contact with my emotions, but I think, I'd say, Understanding people is how people think about me in their shoes, I think that would be one thing because I'm the kind of person, where:, People say they love me or take care of me and I'm okay great thanks I appreciate that, but I don't know how much, I think that's a realization of how much they care about me and love me., That's one thing I like, Getting more, on a, Take a look at this., <laughter> my best friend <deep breath> uh she describes me as someone funny, Crazy, um, Objective, to be loyal, Ambitious hard work around, If I'm just kidding, she says you're so mean, but..., I just like it, I joke around all the time and all the way around, We just planned, uh, a friend of mine or a friend of ours to have a baby shower, I'll give her some ideas, and there's another friend who's been invited,, We've had some problems in the past, and someone I don't talk to or hang out with has always been very close to us, but I don't really talk to that person, but I don't mind them being there., So she also talked about celebrating her birthday, also at kind of like after the baby shower, And there's another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower, for whom we really didn't do anything, and I'm like good, if we celebrate this person's birthday, we could just as well definitely, You know, honor this person's birthday too, as we are closer to you know that the person xxx birthday has passed, And I said you know exactly why we don't all celebrate birthday, <Laughter> Forget the baby shower just do the birthdays, and then that's when she said you were so mean <Laughter> but she laughed about it so, Yeah, that's good., Yeah, that's good., of which I am very proud in my life <deep breath>, Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., I would say to be there for my family., to be a spiritually and emotionally strong person, Family has gone through a lot of challenges and many times I've been the one to make sure that, everything goes all right and everything ensures that everything goes all the way, So I'd say more than anything to make sure I was there for my family., Yeah, that's good., oh, Okay, thanks., Bye, you got a good one.",0
367,"Yes, I'm fine., I'm a little bit, thoughtful I guess a little, Uh down, but, more or less okay, I was born in annapolis maryland, on the east coast, I originally moved because I went to film school., and then I decided to come I moved to Washton d_c to do some work and now I'm back here again, It's quite different to be from the east coast, it just has a different feeling than it..., but alive, l_a is very has a very different kind of, um, Attitude I think, and so it's a little difficult, but I, But I've gotten more used to it since I got here., Uh, not at all..., When I left things, things were kind of, I lost my job out there, so I had to move out of here quickly to..., To be together, a few people who wanted to help me and I'm just kind of, I don't know if alienated is the right word, but I'm just kind of, not really talk to my family or old friends who often, It's not easy, it's, It's kind of..., I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job, I miss some friends., I miss a lot of relationships I had out there, so it's difficult, I mean, it weighs a lot on my mind, I feel like I've failed., and now I'm here and I don't seem to get back on my feet, so it's hard, Depends on the situation, I think I'm going out when I feel comfortable., And then I'm out extremely, but when I'm in a situation, I don't feel comfortable with me tending to be much shyer, so that doesn't really answer your question, but, Um, um..., I'm sure,, I do a lot of writing, I'm sure,, Music I hear, how I write and when I can, if I really can get into that and somehow can turn off the rest of the world around the music and the thoughts somehow, It's really happening..., it can calm me it's like it's when I feel the most relaxed I think, um, A few weeks ago, I guess I was working on a book about one about a novel., and when I was real, When I really wrote it and..., it really worked for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was reaching something and I felt really relaxed, um, It was about a, Guy who's looking for, something it is, It's his last day on Earth, and so he'll find a person he'll be looking for., that he or she:, and only, was so impressed that he had to find her and spend the last minutes he had with her on Earth just because, It's kind of romantic., Adventure Comedy kind of thing, Well, I always did I was always a writer part of the reason why I came to l_a was because of writing the script, So I wrote some scripts and uh, You know, had a little success with that out here and but since then I've been kind of tired of the boundaries of the script and I've started to write more short stories and and longer, only creative writing so, I wanted to write a novel, but I was just waiting for the idea, to really beat me, It's not just the [breathing out], parts parts, if it is good, it is really good, but it is sometimes a real fight for, I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I love it when I just love it absolutely but sometimes i, Hate it because it's so difficult, um, but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good, good I have not I have not really a temperament i, It's not I mean most of my anger I have is directed inward, unlike outwards to other people, If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can, lose, but I probably < try> that's probably just happening to me three four times in my whole life I mean in general I mean pretty much, Try it when I'm angry, I'm not getting mad with myself with other people, um, last night I guess well <weh>um, I was arguing about whether or not., Cleaning of vegetables was necessary because, I forget it but it was good no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay, so it became this, great argument and we have Google searches to find out who was right and who was wrong and i, I was wrong about this one at the end, but, It's, Yeah, it wasn't, it was an exploding argument, but it was a definite argument., um, uh, So much..., uh, i, i, I was in a relationship that I really, um, that I really wanted to work, and, uh, I landed and it was partly on, I wasn't on I wasn't on the right medication and so I went, like everything that was torn out of a spiral., Control and I feel really guilty about the way that ended and I mean, I wasn't, I wasn't mean, but I was, But I got messed up more and more, and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I really feel guilty about not doing enough and not, And you know she has to tell me she never wanted to see me again., so, that was nice, that was pretty hard, Well, some of it was that, I was not properly meditated, I mean, now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that, I mean, I'm still getting, I'm still getting upset and getting depressed, but it's not like it's not, I don't lose it all for days at once, um, so, I mean, I know there's a part of me that logically knows that it wasn't all my fault, and that if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain, then I would probably have been different if I was who I am now., I would have done it if I were., I'd be, it would probably have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have been, but I mean, I could, I don't know if I could have done anything else., Things as they were, I mean, it's, it's possible uh, I mean obviously, Yeah, because I mean, that's what I'm doing., I mean, I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until, Until it makes me crazy, I stay on things, um, and it's like every little detail that comes, I suddenly remember and it can just throw me away for a whole day I still mean, I'm still getting, I'm still getting really uncomfortable and barricaded and then ashamed of things I did in high school, that was years ago and years ago I shouldn't even think about it because it's in the past, but I still get the feeling that I'm right there, Well, it's not, just I've been trying to figure out how to deal with it I mean with him for a long time through, by drinking and you know, just try to slow down my mind this way, But since the medications it's better, it wasn't impossible to deal with, it wasn't easy, but it's, but it's been better, Like I said, I'm doing a lot, Do you know when I write or when I do something like I almost have to do it?, Do two things at once to completely occupy my brain, When I see t_v, I have to play a game on my phone when I use the computer, I have to be., You know, a t_v show or a movie about you know, in another window, so I just, Keep my mind busy during all this, um, I just need, I mean,, I wish I could just let the thoughts come and deal with them, but I just can't yet, They're triggered by everything., pretty much everything I see when I, if i, When I hear someone with a Dutch last name, when I hear someone talking about Wisconsin, when I hear that you know people are talking about it., only, Everything you know, I can get back and connect, to, to this it is really it is really, I don't know that this is the thing I mean, I never get a break, from him, Yeah, that's good., um, I don't know that I'm a very light sleeper, so I..., awake and sleep and awake and sleep <asl> I have no problem sleeping again but I generally, You know you don't know., I don't know that I never really needed much sleep., it's just recently that I've really started to like the effects of not feeling enough sleep, as I would usually stay up to two or three in the morning so I could just be so exhausted that I could just wake up the next day and feel good going to work, But now it's like I can't, that I still can't get enough sleep, I don't think I'm still sleeping very easily., You know, I get up and turn around all night., You know it and now, It's just, It's, Yeah, I'm not sleeping too well now., um, pretty I mean, I don't know, it's hard, it's hard to know, I usually just some kind of power through them and just, I'm how I am now, I just feel, bad, um, I think, about three three four years ago, um, It was when I, I had given to take things for fear for, for, Years before, but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you really did., This, Situation and we need you to work on the medications you are not you need to like on these new medications that actually start, even you and heal yourself a little bit of all this, so yes, that was kind of a turning point, but unfortunately, It happened after everything went wrong., I don't know., the moment I don't know that I don't really think I thought about it, too much then, but looking back at it, I feel, It really makes me, angry it makes me really you know where I am right now it makes me really angry that I am, that I had to lose everything because, for, Chemicals in my brain for things I couldn't control, And that you know that the people who were supposed to help me didn't help me, I mean, I paid, I paid a lot of money to go to doctors, and they did, and they knew it wasn't., It didn't help, it didn't work until, Until, You know, I found someone who worked and I'm just yes, so I'm like thank you guys for the help, but, it was a little bit late now, um, There was really no choice I had to be I was I was a mess I was, It was either, I was meditating myself it influenced my work I mean it was all just at a point where I really realized that I meant I just had to do this differently, but again it was too late because you know, then my review came a few months later and you know, after, after all, after having institutionalized one or two times and all the stuff you know they just decided that I just didn't worth it so they let me go, but it was at least, that and not, Fires me, but yes, but that's how I got help, but it was, but it wasn't early enough, uh not, not as much as I should, um, I'm going to a couple, Meetings, I'm going to a_a so that I, To know you also keep control of this aspect <t> and there is one aspect of therapy that, Unfortunately, you know you're unemployed., My unemployment ran out of you know I'm you know I'm my meds from the city l_a so, You know, I'm not really able to see money, Someone, so I have a psychiatrist I see, but it's really, Very, I only saw her three times last year., It's basically to let my medications come, And then there's you <Laughter>, Right, Like I said, I mean, just the speech <tah> I mean, the ones we just take the a_a for example, because that's probably the next <cloth> closest for what I see with the therapy for now, Just to say what's silent is just..., how to get this stuff out, try to figure out how to make this mess in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and phrases that make sense, with which you can actually deal, is a big step like, regardless of who:, You tell me if it's a therapist or just a room full of drunks, you know, I mean, you take all this, Things that really killed you, and you make it something that you can handle something that you can write down what you can do., talk about in contrast to just let it sit there only as this formless thing, Yeah, that's good., um, You know better than me when I was., It's kind of, it goes <g> it has its ups and downs, I'm applying for a job., five six jobs, or more a day you know and never get an answer that never gets an interview, never get any closer, to be self sufficient again, um, It's hard, but that's like real world problems I feel, how the chemical parts get under control, how the depression gets under control, So now it's just I have to deal with the real life, that's, it just has its own it's just its own challenge, Yeah, that's good., um, it was probably you know a few years ago, um, I was, I mean the thing that comes to mind right away, uh, is, everything went well at my job I made these great videos with this person I had a relationship with and we were really close, we had fun together, and we went out and got a Christmas tree, and, We spent all the time choosing the perfect Christmas tree and it was just, Feeling like a part of someone's life, and feel like part of the larger, The Greater Life, That's the one out there that you know how normal people feel, You know for this moment that I felt like, a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl he really liked and, You know everything went well and, I mean, it didn't go really well because it was all messed up, but for that moment I felt like a normal person, a normal happy person, and, Part of what makes it so difficult now is to know that, I don't know if I'll ever feel that again., so, um, probably the, This is likely to be the, Education <educary> Education series I got uh, a pedagogical, uh video series I did for the National Science Foundation, um, It was, it was really hard and it was, but in the end it became really good and, You know, I hope it helps a lot of kids, and it helps the world get kids excited about science, and..., and about the world around it, so I felt that this was a real contribution I made to, the world, Oh, it was part of you that it was part of my job., It was a, we tried to come with, with new ideas uh, because we'd be together videos and things you know, to schools and everything and they had done before, but we decided to do something really big, You know, and there were a lot of trips, and there were a lot of trips around, and there was a lot to him and so, it was probably the biggest, Project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just produced it somehow, right, that doesn't yeah, um, I guess..., I don't know <Laughter> uh, I don't know, it's been a while since I've really been thinking that I don't know, would I go somewhere I, I don't know., Thank you.",19
368,"Yeah, I'm fine with that., I'm fine., I guess..., Scrubbed_entry, I'm basically a guy, Cool, um, You know, the weather it's usually pretty sunny and temperate you know, I really like the climate a lot, I like the girls you know here., I like to see, I don't like the traffic you know, but, I like the Hispanic population pretty well., And I have a lot of friends here, so I guess you know I don't want to be anywhere else, I mean, like I said, the traffic you know I was on the four on five, you know, that's always kind of you know crommy, the cost of living you really know, terrible about l_a it's always expensive, and, You know I don't like it., I really don't like you knowing them., as it seems like to l_a's one of those places where you are you know that you either know like one, a ton of money and fame and fortune or as you know that you know below in which you know the ghettos you are, I've been to a few places., Uh, you know, but very briefly, you know, it was mostly for school., I went to arizona and new york and montana a lot of anthropology as you know and archaeology field trips and such things, Uh, nothing I'm doing right now, I like to get away from the city that you know I was in Yosemite last year you know summer for vacation that was kind of nice you know Yosemite was really around, really nice to see, but uh just basically getting away from the city I guess you know away from work getting away from the stress here, Uh I actually studied political science and I also studied economics around, I'm a great kind of policy you know junkie you know to start with, so I naturally somehow fell in line with this type of study, It was me, but I lost my job., And you know that's kind of a moron that you know I lost it., Oh, my God!, It's been a year and a half, now maybe two years and a half., um, You know that the economy got bad and budget cuts got bad, And you know I wish I'd work there again., uh, I wanted to be a lawyer, and I wanted to be a lawyer., and so I took political science and I took a double major in economics, and uh the sad thing is the sad thing I regret is that I know anyway you know to get into law school, you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats, and I studied for it how really hardcore you know for about a year and I took the xxx test and like an idiot around I didn't feel right about the day it was a kind of day off, And you know, it was like you know the big game at the Superbowl that you know, that I just don't feel like I did it well and I canceled the test and all that around, You know, I kind of regret that you know, <Laughter> Tell me about it, I'm not really shy, I'm definitely not shy., but starting I don't mean one of these people <peo> I'm not flamboyent You know I'm going to talk to people I don't mind talking to people I don't mind, I'm meeting people who are good with me, but it's not like you know I'm dying to meet someone., I guess..., around these days uh you know I play guitar you know I taught myself how to play guitar, um, I know I should have done more of it., but I also like to exercise around uh I'm on a diet right now, but my diet was terrible time eating habits were terrible, but the exercise part is just great I love to train <exerci> I love to run, this is one of my best things to do for stress is how to run and how to train, I just wish my eating habits were in line uh or a little better you know,, To <sigh> my temperament you might know definitely improved uh a lot you know to, You know many times I feel I'm one of those introverted guys people when it comes to how you know that I don't mind being extroverted or meeting people and like having a good time, whatever, When I'm angry, I really don't want you to talk to people I don't like screaming, I don't like screaming, I don't like beating, I don't like fighting, I kind of close up a lot, I don't just want to be left alone, sometimes I tend to put it on longer than it should be, You know, the woman doesn't like it too much, and maybe I know I just don't want to talk about it <Laughter> I just don't want to deal with it., I kind of shut down and shut down, you know?, Switch off for a little bit, Oh, my God!, um, You know it doesn't happen too often., Maybe with my wife, You know that we were probably something stupid that knows, Who knows?, um, the, I mean, I don't have a lot of guilt, I'm not doing anything to make me feel like you know a person you know is bad., There are things that, as you know, I call minor sins, You know, I get white lies or whatever you know, but nothing like so disgusting that makes me feel guilty., um, Let's see, I guess,, Sometimes you know., You know, I'm a married guy, but I know sometimes there are times you know I like it, You know you're smiling at a girl, or, as you know, you're getting a girl's attention, you know, I don't know that I never go, I never do anything about it, I never get her phone number or as you know, but, Sometimes I like it, Talk to people, I guess, you know, That's a good question., I guess..., I guess you know I always do the same thing, there's not that I never want to change, I never want to deal with things differently, I'm always pretty comfortable how I deal with things and you know I think I could be much worse and as you know, screaming and screaming and beating and that and that and that and that, And that's just not me, you know, I think the best you know is kind of like, get a lot of breathing space a lot of space and around I don't want that to change or treat any of it differently I just don't basically know what else to do, You know., And you know, the last thing I want to do is talk about feelings, or talk about anything that you know that's the last thing I want to do, and like I don't want me to treat something like that differently., You know, I'm pretty happy with my family now, you know, if I'm married and we have a baby on the way, Which is kind of beautiful, around we have a few cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and around my mother I love my mother intimately, um, She has diabetes that she doesn't control., You know, she doesn't control it and likes it how uh it affects her health and it always worries me about her and how stress about her and she could do so much to prevent it and she doesn't and, I have a good relationship with my mother, I love her very much and I really have a good relationship with everyone I think, I think I've got a ton of family and friends around, who get along pretty well with me, you know actually, Yeah, that's good., There are times that are good. I mean, it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep. I feel like you know I'm sleeping like a baby., the only problem I have, I think, is I feel, how you know sometimes how you fall asleep and you're just going to sleep and you're kind of like a yolk you know how you almost like a case, anyway it's like a falling feeling or something, and it doesn't happen so often, but it happens, and around but for most of the time <ti> part by no I sleep like a stone I sleep really well, Well, right now, I've felt in general., worry and and fearful and, You know, uh, and tense and the reason why is because I said my mom to right, at least today, Well, I found out that my mother did something that she didn't tell me the whole story, and I kind of wait until this is over so we can figure out what's wrong with her., But..., You know, I'm worried about her, she's in the hospital, she's with the doctors right now, so that doesn't tell me anything good., and to you know to try to find a job, so that also got me worried, and you know the baby on the way, so I got worried, so I feel like a [sharp inhalation] you know, overwhelmed with a just a lot of how you know how to do things and how, and, much on my much on my plate and how much of it has nothing to do with me, but I have to treat it the way you know, the way I think, Well, I keep distracted I keep myself busy I feel like a busy body you know, and the more it seems like you know it seems like it's not a good thing because I feel I'm just adding more things on my plate, so, um, You know how one of the things I do is like exercise and so I have to train every day that you know, but that takes an hour, as you know, change and you just start to run and how to go through the whole thing of stretching and cooling, which takes some time and then like to shower, all the kind of stuff takes time, so I have to do it every day so that I can finish it this way, I also finished knowing you're playing guitar, but that only, more of a distraction that you know what I mean, keep you know to keep busy as it seems simple as if it wasn't, You know to work towards you, know the goals, You know I have to do as you know I can find a job I should do, but then..., You know, it's one of those things where I don't think there's any good jobs I've been looking for and looking for, and sometimes when I do, it's just not what I want to do, it just doesn't seem, For example:, <Laughter> as I want uh, Make one of these like terrible jobs, I xxxx it's you know it's it, Probably harder than I think about it, because sometimes I feel like, You know, one of these things is like, uh..., I feel like it's hard, But it's not I mean, there are ways to deal with it, You know, I kind of have to accept that you know that I sort of internalized it., And how uh you know, It's not something that's like I'm not out on the street or something like that, but you know it's a concern., I've never diagnosed with p_t_s_d I worked with., no, no, Man, Ten years ago, <Laughter> I don't know, uh, see, the last time I was really happy maybe, I mean nothing, I feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know I learned to feel a new song on the guitar <fe> I feel like, I'm not even happy that you know I'm like..., You know, I work sometimes and that makes me happy that you run as fast as you know, but that doesn't make me so excited or anything., I just feel good., You know, so I have this this, in those times when I'm just you know I'm feeling good, about me and I feel, you know, but I never feel great I never feel happy I never feel as sensational as you know and and, And you know it, I can't believe you know it's just..., You know there are these mild times when there are some good times., you know and a few bad times, but the good times are never <n> never <ne> never extremes, you never know really good times and never really terrible bad times you know, Well, I wish this diet would work a little better you know, but that's kind of hard you know because I like the kind of guy that just likes, Who likes you to know about you, rice and how uh mexican food and how <Sharp inhalation> you know to and to snack and uh, I don't know, I just feel like I could change I wish I could change my eating habits as I can, as you know, because I'm learning so much that I feel like I'm running as much and doing as much activity as you know., That if I mean you know diet in check around, You know this would go a long way, I wish I could change you, too., my <m> my, my uh, I guess my, I feel like the economy is so bad., and how things are so rough that, You know, it's like pointless, even if you know looking for this kind of jobs like, it just seems like I just wish I had a little more inspiration to like a lot more motivation, to <Laughter>, <sigh> does things, The one thing I regret is not, is not to you know is this lsat thing you know about, you know, I can't cancel the test to start it, because I'm sure I could have gone to a school, but then, as you know, it made me think that I really want to pay a bunch of how you know law school and the cost of it and how, You know, just to..., just to be stacked with more work and so on anyway, I don't know it just doesn't seem like, How uh, I mean, there's an idea of justice and, and around and republicanism, And you know things that I really know you, stick to, that I fall in love with, And that I don't want to get away, But it seems like it's a lot of work and money., and easy to like it for the small percent of success,, that you know that maybe you don't really make such a field that you might know that maybe I just don't like, It's worth overcoming the obstacles I have to overcome, ugh < sigh>, I have no idea I would <Laughter> I would <wu> twenty years ago I would tell myself maybe, um, You know, I think I've done everything really well for myself, except for the lsat thing you know which I'm going to do., You know the regrets on one side on the other, You know, I'm not sure I regret it because of the bills and all the stuff I told you about,, And you know, I think you know that I was waiting to get married, that I was waiting for a kid., I've known you pretty carefully about the decisions <deci> You know I don't take drugs I don't drink I don't fight I don't do any of these things like things like you know that, I think that real people know,, And then she really as you know ruin her life you know like, I'm pretty happy and satisfied with, You know the godfearing whom you know., uh, I don't know., Oh, my best friend, I think he kind of likes me <li> he likes me he wants me to do more things with him, but he works at night, And you know it's one of those things I think most people not only have my best friend, but my wife and maybe the rest of my family., feel that I don't put much, Time and attention to them I mean, they think I'm pretty great when I give them the, Time of the day and my attention, but I don't know if I'm really there all the time you know, I don't know if I'm real, You know, I'm always thinking about something else I'm always thinking about something else, I don't know if I can really give them a real one., You know, shoulder to cry, or you know, if you ask for something you know, I'll usually do it., You know, but I almost feel like it's like a job, like you know, like she's..., you know, If they really need me, then I'll do it, you know, if they're just asking for a favor, I almost feel like you know I'm doing it., I just feel <f> and it's not because I hate them or anything I really like, it's just that I have the feeling, I almost don't want to say that I owe it to them, but the mere fact that I'm her boyfriend somehow makes her..., You know, uh, as I do it anyway makes me, as you know, they rely on me some you know times or how I don't want to let them down they're my friends, but it's the same time, I just feel like it's, it's more it's not it's not it's more like doing a job instead of a job., a willingness like an oh my God, as I just want to help you, it's never <ne> it's never that it's just something I do because I somehow have to know you need to know, I have to do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know, and I end up like them, and they'd probably do it for me., And I know you, so I just..., Well, there are a few things I like that I have good <go> I feel good about myself you know, You know I ran the marathon that feels good., I graduated from college that feels good, you know what I mean, but the thing is, I don't feel that way., like pride in myself, Because you know these things alone, like studying from college, You know I didn't really succeed, you know what I mean., um, Running the marathon didn't make me thin and trim, So they're like half the merits, You know, or how they are, they're great, you know, Lotta people may not have done half-way, a lot of people have gone beyond each other., But..., You know, they're kind of like kickstones that like, that around I seal real new no, Life < l>Lifelong, benefit from other than the fact that I can say that I have done, yeah yeah no problem no problem thanks for your time you know to hope you enjoy you know uh in this computer, Oh, goodbye., I'm gonna press this button now",7
369,"Sure, yes, Thank you for asking me., You know how about yourself, Oh awesome, I'm from Guatemala., My parents moved here to the United States when I was three years old., So yes., mhm, Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know., I haven't been there yet, but I haven't been to my hometown yet., for ages, Uh just you know I have all my family here my mother my father my cousins aunts uncle so, I've got my life here, so I'm probably, I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, You know it's just my curiosity that you don't know, I guess., Oh, all right., I love the people who are all nice, I love the variety you know, there are different types of, People and you know the imagination out there everything is just great, You know everyone's different, you know nobody's like him, at least on some aspects., Um, and I love the landscape I love, the mountains they're beautiful., You know, good for hiking you know, take the dog know the family you know, It's nice, it's pretty active yes, Uh the smog <Laughter>, I don't like smog, it's just..., You know, if you keep going, you know you can see it in the air you know, or, You know everything is clear the sky is blue <Laughter> but different from that, as you know and traffic <Laughter> No one likes traffic I think,, Yeah, that's good., Yeah, but..., Yeah, you know that pretty much l_a is pretty nice you know it's I like it, um, Well, I just studied, you know, I'm not exactly sure what I want to be, so it's just kind of knowing about you, Here and there you jump through tires and so, not really, It's just that I'm still trying to find my interests, I suppose., so, My dream job hm, That's a good one., I love working with kids, so I'd say probably a child psychologist just because you know it's great., you know what's going on in the young minds, And you know how we can help kids find a better way, You know, kids make you know or help, You know, help them you know growing in a positive way I thought instead of going the wrong track, Yeah, that's good., All I know is that you're helping kids., It's important that it depends on the situation I'm in, sometimes you know that I could be like super-going and just like you know, and sometimes like it just I could be quite calm or something not and just make sure you know if I'm like in class or whatever, I don't really like it and there's everyone talking I just would prefer it just to, Stay away from what you know, because I need something else to focus on something else you know there's a moment and time for everything I take, Yeah, that's good., um, I like to kick my feet on the couch and enjoy reading a good book you know., You know, I'm going to see someone else., galaxy or universe; or, Situation you know it's pretty funny that you just know, You know, read and then just, feel relaxed and you know that you feel good, Yeah, it's just fun I love reading, um, I'm not the best you know., You know, I'm trying my best, and I guess that's all I could do until I keep, Better work at the end, But I'm not like the best, I mean, sometimes I have my outbursts you know., But you know, I guess that's all., I'm not sure haha you know, uh huh, That's a good question., In order to:, I don't remember <Laughter> uh let's see uh, Honestly, I don't remember, maybe, uh, Oh, my God., I don't know, <Laughter> I sometimes I'm very passive that I just let go like things, because I mean, what's the point of making a big thing out of things, You know it so..., I don't know., I'm not I can't be honest I can't tell you that <Laughter> at this moment, sure yeah probably come back to it, um, What are you doing?, Well, I guess,, When I was younger, I knew I could have been a better older sister and I wasn't, And that makes me guilty for sure, You know I could have been a better sister., Better role model <Laughter> You know, but I'm trying to do my best now, so I'm trying to do things better., and it works <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., I guess, huh?, hm, I don't know, I mean, I am the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life, so, If I delete something, it's just something from me in my present self or you know that would change and, I don't know, I'm pretty okay with the person I'm now I mean, You know, I don't think I'd change an event., You know, I'm fine with what, They know ups and downs and good and bad that happened, so, Yeah, that's good., I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel much., but I'm kind of like a explorer I think I love how to explore, even the smallest things, like when I walk, I walk away and you know, I find my way up, You know it somehow, and you just do it., You know to travel, I'd like to do that, but..., I don't know, only you know., always circumstances in my life, which, You don't always know something that you know I'm marrying children you know and all that, So it's kind of the way you know it, It'd be nice, I guess you know, It'd be nice, You know, I love camping, the way you know it takes a few days out there camping and you know fishing <Laughter> yeah, um, Uh it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice, it was just me and he you know, and it was like nobody and it was like nice because it was just in the middle of the forest with a beautiful lake and, You know, it was really nice., It's just yeah, Yeah, that's good., Yes yes it was it was it was really fun it was like I'd like to do it again, You know right now., it would be great, you know, just going out there it's just I love the adventure of things and nature and just life and you know overall, Yeah, that's good., uh, It's easy, but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because, I don't know, just you know that I'm lying there and I'm just trying to sleep and I'm just like ugh, but at some point I do <Laugher> you know, I just like it probably need to be, Position me on another side of the bed as sometimes I'm in the headboard and I'm like ah I have to go to the other side and, Once I've positioned myself, I'll just go to sleep., But I have to find the right position for myself., Yeah, that's good., um, I'm tired <Laughter> I get tired all day, but, I'm trying to shake it off, you know, and just like that, Feel like a new day you know and just try to make the day I have as big as possible, you know and then try to like it by sleeping at night, the day of <Laughter> you know, So yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, It's okay, I'm trying to do the best, I think., if not, then I just go to sleep all day sucking, Of course., Uh no <Laughter>, no, I felt good., Yeah, I feel really good., you know a lot of things in my life you know that I've got a really good year so far, so I'm very happy with that you know everything is, you know how good you are, you know, Yes, it is, except that I just came out of a cold and it was terrible, but, this is just nature <Laughter> my immune system must work harder <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., To super happy was uh, when the doctor told me I was pregnant, You know that I, really really happy about it and I was just like ah you know that was really good you know, very excited and just reading what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and, Oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time < laughter> I never really like uh you know, but yeah, I've been very happy, uh, um, I don't know, I guess just myself, I, uh, you know how, You know, I could know that you're just me, and that's what you know, but I can't really, You know, say, I have certain thing I think I mean, it depends on the person who meets me, to tell me I can't really tell myself how oh I am that I am that only you know, just try to be my best and try to tell me something good for other people, tell me, or you know compliment me or what not, Yeah, that's good., um, <Laughter> nothing I think <Laughter>, as I said, I am happy with the person I am just, And you know my mistakes or what you know, I could have every mistake people see in me, and it's okay, you know I'm okay with it., Whatever it is right now, I'm not gonna do it., I can't change for other people's preferences <Laughter> I only have one body and one life so yeah, Yeah, that's it., uh, only my childhood with my sisters and my family, but, You know you know you're learning from it., you learn from the past and you feel like hey you know, maybe I should be a better role model that you know for my kids and so my kids could be better models so the world could only improve., um, only smile and be happy, You know, whatever hard things happen, you know you're gonna get through them someday., The only thing you can't do., I don't know you can't., you know, You know, you might know the heartache, or it's whatever, but you know, as long as I'm alive, I still have to go on., Yes <Laughter>, um, I don't know., That's pretty., huh most proud of, I guess I'm trying my best to be the best I could be and that's pretty powerful you know I'm, You know, I'm trying to be, you know, a better person every day and try to like, You know, improve yourself every day, as much as I can, You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of., as much as I can, Very hard <Laughter> I won't lie about it is really hard, you know, because I can't say that you know it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good you know,, and you know it's always challenges and everything you know in your life, but, You know it only happens sometimes., You know, hard you know, and sometimes it comes easy you know, after a while you get a lot of exercise and all is how you have a great day and you haven't even tried < laughter> you know,, So yes., um, you know, loving friendly around you know adventurous I guess I don't know, I guess that's what they say <Laughter> I just know you know that they like, You know, but that's what I'm at least trying to be, At least you know I'm trying to, always give a best foot forward, as much as possible you even know, Sometimes, even if I'm having a hard day, I'm just like you know., You know, I just don't want to take it out on anyone or anything you know., Yeah, that's good., around <Laughter> my ideal weekend, Usually I like to go to the park, I sit like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree, where there are shadows and how, my blanket out there has my dog and, how to read a book and you know sometimes, If I don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them, so that's pretty nice, you know., just sit there and just the air and the, Noise, I guess because there's no silence, knowing the wind and the cars, and you know it's just great., Yeah, that's good., awesome, Thank you for being welcome <Laughter>, See you.",0
370,"Yeah, that's good., Thank you for asking me how you're doing., I grew up from here in l_a in the San Fernando Valley, Yeah, that's good., Uh <sigh> Well, I like the variety of people the different types of food that you can eat I like to, the outdoor opportunities that I grew near the hills, so I did a lot of hiking around, Camping is pretty close to I have snowboarding around I like, the familiarity I think and you know it's a big city and you know I'm pretty familiar with living here for so long that, I'd say I like that too, Uh the long commuting also you know for short distances around, And then you know it gets really hot in the summer sometimes so you know, that before I could bear to be a little bit cooler when it comes to its peak heat, but, That's all right., wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a big question i <laughter>, I think my dream job would probably uh you know maybe be able to travel and somehow, make money out of him profit from him you know do business of traveling, but, It's almost an unrealistic dream, because I don't know if I would really do that, but if I did,, If I had to choose some kind of dream existence, you know that travel is paid to meet new people and try new things., and able to make a living out of it would be pretty funny, well I like as I mentioned what I like about l_a I like to try different types of food different kitchens, so I think authentic cuisine in different places to try and meet different types of people who would see different ways of life uh, anyway, what I like about traveling around I like to experience new things around, I think that would be nice, you know, although the fact that I said I like the familiarity of l_a there is also, Fun in discovering new things, so I think traveling <tr> When I travel, that's what I like to do, just check out new things around, So I'd like you to know if I could live with doing that would be great, uh one of my trips okay well let's see the last, Travel i i, taken to, lemmi think of a <on> yet an exciting journey around, Now my family is from Eastern Europe, so one of the trips I made with my parents when I was 14, I was too, Austria hungary and Romania and uh you know that some of these old castles to see <ca> I was a couple of times before, but I was when I was little, so I didn't really remember too much and I didn't really do things quite the same as when I was a little older, So I need to see that you know that my family is old and you know the hometown that you know we have a family., For example:, Tomb so I got to see that then only these old buildings and only the other kind of life, I really liked that you know to see my parents old friends, you know, and, So that was pretty funny it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from me, My home environment, you know, I went in the middle of the school year, so it was like going to America suburban from you., Travel through type of uh you know with these old trains and see these castles and these old as well as hundreds of years old cities and, I don't know if it was for everyone you know, I don't know if it would be great for everyone, but I really enjoyed it, Uh that's a good question I'm doing <sigh> uh I'm probably one of the things I'm doing is either turn on like a repeat of a sitcom used to i to make the office much so, I kind of know when this is on, so I'm gonna do this, that you know, just some kind of zone from a little too uh you know how, familiar characters and and hear jokes that are still funny for some reason or around, Maybe how to eat a little comfort food you know I'm not trying to eat too much fast food at all, but uh, As in n' out I really like going there, so if I need to relax you know it's once every few months maybe I'll do that, Uh or I really like to read it around especially like uh I'll read the events of the day you know that this really, relaxes me for some reason, even if it reads about something that is going on somewhere in the world a conflict is going on, I will still read the headlines and, I really like to know what is on this kind of centers me around so I really enjoy that this is something I do to relax, I'd say I'm pretty good at it, although I don't think my nature makes it pretty easy <eas> that pretty easy I don't <Laughter> I'm not getting very excited <up> excited about just so, It's not a big challenge to control my temper., Yes, I don't know <do> I don't really have anger problems I it's difficult for me to get angry, uh so I don't, I don't really have much trouble with that., The last time I argued with someone was probably <sigh>, I don't even know that I have my little disagreements that you know I'd have uh with family or friends about, Things, but just a full argument i i i i can't even remember that it's been years since I didn't really argue too much, I'm trying to avoid conflicts, as much as possible in my personal life, really see something to be won, and I kind of uh naturally repell away from him, so I don't, I'm sorry I don't have much to say about arguments., something that I feel guilty about saying that you sometimes know that I'm anyway sometimes I don't really care about, I have the feeling that I may not have made the most of my potential in life I think that I could definitely do more despite the fact that I work a lot around, I feel like I'm getting more and more ways out there that we miss I feel like you know sometimes downtime I feel a little guilty about it because there's always something I could do that I'm not, Even if it's just the laundry I took out of the dryer that's sitting there, or, I run late, I really don't like running late, although it happens more than I'd like and I don't know why I feel guilty that I don't like to keep people waiting, wait because it feels like you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs, which is obviously not true, Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., for nothing comes to mind immediately, Now <sigh> the last car accident I got in i, it was a few years ago I think I wish it hadn't happened that I wish I could have deleted it from my memory, but I anyway, was, I thought the cars in front of me would go, you know, at least for a little you know, ten fifteen feet, but it turns out that they had stopped them, so it was a < deep breath> you know xxx slowly, Heck-end collision, but it was still very unhappy, I was just uh you know it felt like I was watching a second and in the next second you know I was just like, to reach something in the passenger seat and then I banged in front of me in the car and [deep breath] uh I wish that hadn't happened absolutely uh I know <kn> I know it's a little thing, but, it was just really unhappy timing it was very bad you know for me financially and the people I got into an accident were fine, but I was <wa> you know they, You know you didn't ask for anything but to repair the damage, but it was just terrible timing., I wish that hadn't happened., it sucks <Laughter> it has sucks I'm about it now but anyway it does suck, Well, I'm a pretty good sleeper I though I'm of course wired to later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job to allow me to get a fairly flexible schedule, but on the same token uh, I wish I could <cou> were like hard wired to go to sleep earlier because I just end up staying on, Until one or two every night uh and, It's just too late, you know, even if I'm a full eight hours or what's not sleeping it's not always at night, you know that half of my sleep is like in the kind of early daylight hours and I wish I was, more than, able to sleep you know going to sleep like ten or eleven, and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to, go to sleep later and wake up later, I feel pretty good, I didn't complain physically, and you know I feel good., You know my relationships with my family and friends are good., around everything is great so far I have absolutely no real complaints uh as far as I feel about myself or anything, No, no, I was pretty much in line with my behavior and my thoughts that I think to, everything was pretty okay pretty stable no nothing traumatic nothing about somehow a resurgence from the past nothing like that has happened or happens, no, no, Well, I think there are a lot of things that everyone regrets, yes, there are many things about <sigh>, in my life uh yeah as I said i, I regret uh you know maybe don't try harder in my younger days you know i, There's a period of time in my early twenties where I didn't work for a while I just uh, I was hanging out with a lot of friends you know, I guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked just uh you know we, We got high every day or it seemed like I don't know every day that it was just... eh, but it was some kind of throwaway time in my life., I would say that to <sigh>, It's important, to deal with the world, I think I think I've let something out of the world, a bit I think it's also I would say that it's important to, Recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what kind of potential you know future activities you can expect from, The people you're dealing with, I think I'd say that..., somehow trying to focus on what I wanted to do with my life instead of just thinking well you know that things will work,, After all, they do, but I think you know that it's lost a little time with this..., the approach is somehow fatalistic, and I think that I would say that you know to just try to concentrate you know that you don't know that not everyone works according to the same schedule and life is not a race, but I would say that, it was important to have a goal in mind or a kind of, You know idea for what you want from life as opposed to just waiting somehow and to think that things are falling in place, To <sigh>, Good i <sigh>, I guess when people don't give me much, take even constructive criticism especially well for some reason I think that for < f> at least for me I've somehow figured things out, although I'm sure I'm wrong that, So I just think in terms of how uh group work I've done professionally or academically you know when some of my work is, Sorted or tested, I don't do well, and I take it personally when I should., Uh it was probably about a year and a half ago I was working on a research project at work and uh someone with much less experience < exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to pass it and it was someone, Just from college you know., went beyond what we had done and, You know, it was just some kind of rewording things and it just seemed like cosmetic changes that were made just to change things and, I took some personal insult that just because I thought I had a lot more experience and more education and uh, It was unnecessary for you to know that I thought this whole thing was a waste of time, and you know that I just..., I didn't think she was someone who was qualified to repeat all our work, or even to uh, not to repeat, but to edit or to Uh <sigh> not <no> eh Proofreading I think to make any kind of, You know, qualitative changes I just thought it was a really bad idea, and I thought I knew you shouldn't have seen it that way, but I thought that, the fact that they brought in someone with almost no experience you know was an affront to us who had been working on this project, but, You know it wasn't our call., mm most memorable experiences around, Well, I guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my..., the first real trip I took from me uh i I took the uh the amtrak to new mexico and I was out there exploring things around, for about ten days alone uh so that was somehow the longest, Period of time up to this point and I was in my I was I don't know, twenty-three maybe at the time that I, I was really on my own from all I was in parts of the new Mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time., and it was very memorable because I felt on it on my own I was like I was really uh you know the things I wouldn't have seen if I had travel companions around and it was a lot of fun, Uh good i was very happy recently i was getting married in a couple of months uh i got engaged on the day of work uh in two thousand twelve thanks <Laughter> so i was uh that was a very happy day of this whole process you know to meet someone and we, We went very fast and recognized where we were, so I was a pretty man., I think we got engaged and then we shared it with our family., very happy times around new years was happy you know, uh I'm in a happy period of my life at the moment so, Yeah, that's good., Yes, thank you <Laughter>, Uh <sigh> with a <sigh> type of, sense of humor that maybe not everyone gets I'd say uh also uh, You know., helpful rest maybe relax uh <sigh>, intelligent, you know I like to recycle, that's something they'd say., i, what else I think about my best friend could say that, I like animals I've always had dogs and cats so they can describe me as a human person or I mean an animal person apologize to me, also know about you quite simply you know flexible with plans, mm, I'd say one of the most proud in my life..., hmm <tisk>, well <sigh> i i i i am pretty happy with the level of education I've got, i also go back anyway beginning in autumn i start a p_h_d program so i am happy that i am happy that i know about you, break some of my bad habits from the past i would say if i'm proud of everything, it's that, I'm often very happy that I don't know if pride is the right word, but..., my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh, I'd say maybe the fact that, It's much different from my life is much different than it was about ten years ago, you know, the change I'm happy and proud that, no problem have a good day thank you, Goodbye.",0

372,"Yes, um, pretty good type of, <Laughter> yeah, over los engeles, Yes, the thing I like about the weather, It's not easy to meet people, Well, it just feels like, People aren't very out there, they're like the movie in the crash where people are just sitting in their cars all the time., It feels like this, no, not too much, Development of children, Well, I have a son and, I wanted to know how to make a good mother and so I wanted to know, about the stages he would go through, eh and be able to relate better to him, mhm, I'm, I'm trying to start it again in the fall., I'd like to write, All right., I wrote some children's books., and, I've just been researching., to get published in my books, it's just like two I've written so far, but, They are, pretty good, I got some good feedback from my review groups, <Laughter> It's about, A little boy surrounded by people who are idiots and he tries to, not to become a fool with them, and <Laughter> it puts him in like a really, Scrubbed_entry, he walks through many moods in dealing with the people in his life, mhm, Yes, I had a few problems with nervous breakdowns and at the moment my son lives with his father, so <Laughter>, No, I'm a single mother, it was the hardest thing., I think in the world <Laughter> is a single mother <Laughter>, so, How can I handle this?, To <sigh>, Good now., um, I didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so, that was the problem, It's so spontaneous, like the stuff that comes out of the children's mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and, only brings a smile to your face, um, Good, when my son was younger, once we sat just around the house and, he comes and he starts to do my hair and he says to me, Mom I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails, So you can go out and get married and find a friend <Laughter> so, Yes, it's quite spontaneous things like that happen, that my child tells me that I don't have to be single anymore, the most difficult <sigh>, I don't want to mess it up, I feel a lot of stress and pressure, the, Every little thing will make a difference and make matter, in what kind of person my child turns out, and, so, There's a lot of stress on yourself <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., Yeah, that's good., Definitely, um, hmm, I think, I'm different from my mother., because I'm a little more tolerant for this spontaneous interaction, I appreciate that you know I'm welcome., I'm getting to know who my child is now., and, don't try to mold them into someone I want them to, but just, see how they will be the best, Child that they are the best adult that they can be without, to shape them necessarily in this direction, to another person <Laughter>, so, Say it again., Who is someone who has a positive influence?, To <sigh>, mm, I don't have anyone., It's like the, All right., All right., I tried to meditate sometimes, but I don't really hold on to it, often enough, um, I tried., to go for walks, but I don't always do that, And I don't always stick with it, so, Yes, it is., I'd say:, I'm, slightly less than average importance, that I'm getting angry, more than most people I think, hmm, last night, <Laughter> but it was on the phone I was arguing with my husband, We have my sister who lives with us., and she lives with us in a very small room with, a small apartment I should say, And she's got four people living in a room, so..., it's kind of stressful it's really crowded, And my husband is stressed about it, and, You know, I'm just saying to him that, I told you when my sister moved in., then there was a mess in the house and she'll ask for things you don't really want to do, so my sister <Laughter> so the house is chaotic and it is crowded, And every day they ask for journeys and my husband, He's..., Avoid coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore, And I'm just saying that, He'll have to find a way to deal with it because, he asked for him, in my opinion, for <Laughter> so <Laughter>, hmm, It does <Laughter>, oh, I've got tons of them, but right now., What comes to my mind is to lose custody of my son., um, Now like, I had a fight with my stepmother., and, my step sister for a long time over, my son and how they treat him and how I want to treat him, as if they had no limits, and I think borders are important to find out who the adult is who the child is, They had my child command her around and all., In any case, because of this, You will testify in custody against me that, Yeah, they'll say I'm not a good mother., Because I believe in borders and we have very different, Ideas about raising children, She's my stepmother, she's my father's fifth wife., and, She's, it's not really far from, how I grew up and I want to raise my child, similar to how I grew up where you are, we had some independence and we had some limitations and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us., and, with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants to run wild, and have everything he wants, and that's okay if you're a grandparents, but the problem is that I live with them sometimes, And when I'm in the same house with them, they should follow my rules., and not, try to go and break all my rules, Yeah, that's good., at this moment <sigh>, only really frustrated because they don't listen to me, I feel, disrespectful I feel, how invisible, I feel, Only angry, the, they take away my right to parenthood and it's something I really worked hard to do, I went to school and studied child development, I've read all the magazines and I've read the books and I'm really <Laughter>, I know what I'm talking about, I feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting skills., and, to have these people who have not done the same thing and have worked as hard as I must be a good parent, Try to tell me I'm a bad parent, It's really, uh, hard to believe, so I feel very disrespectful, um, Unrecognized angry frustrated, all these things <Laughter>, um, I'll take Benadryl to help me sleep, And I'm, so, My doctor gave me that she gave me Benadryl, that I could take it to help me sleep., and last night I cried, before I went to sleep, so sometimes these thoughts begin to run through the head at night when you are in bed, but I tried to push her out and then I got up and I took my Benadryl so I could go to sleep easier, Yeah, I always think about my son., as I wish he were with me, and how unfair all that happens is, And as I don't deserve it, to take my son away from me because I'm a really good mother, you know, and I'm too hard for myself, so, but I'm a good mother and I feel confident that I'm a good mother, I just..., I don't really have the money to take care of my son, like my son's father, who has more money than I do., and right now I'm trying to agree to it because, I know he can do more for him., Financially than I could, But that doesn't mean I'm not a good mother., hmm, I'm pretty depressed I'm on antidepressants, um, I'll take wellbutrin., I've been with you for a few weeks., I think they're working, I don't know., I'm not like, I'm here today and I'm dressed.

feel more than I belong in loose angels than I am back home, the food goes around the weather without saying uh, I like the resources there I like to feel., I like that the things I want to do are

<resour> so many resources out here, so it's not even expensive like New York or Boston, It's not the worst, but..., uh and also I mean, it's a little annoying that every time I want to go home, it's a flight not a ride that I can't mean, imaginable < con> really conceivable, Go home for the holiday because it's a three or four day adventure and just not practical, so it's uh unhappy that I'm so far away in this regard, but, I can't change geography., uh, <laughter> I studied uh history and uh media science and production, uh yes I work as a freelance author and producer, In college I realized that I was pretty good at it and I knew there was a way to monetize that and I got out of here and worked a little uh in the, uh public sector in the attempt, you know, just do these jobs this way and I realized I could, making more money have more control over my schedule and my life when I did it freelance, so I have to do it now for a little more than a year now, I love traveling I try to uh, go somewhere new for a good time, about all uh seven to eight months just trying to mix things up, so I was in barcelona only recently, and I plan, either vietnam or even back to Europe in the next few months so, mhm, I enjoy the break from the routine, I think while it's nice to wake up and somehow have a vague idea where your day is going, after a few months you can get a lot into that and you, Uh pigeonhole I appreciate your thought process your expectations for the day and I love to wake up in a foreign country and just, Knowing that everything I do that day will be brand new and different from what I would do if I was in Los Angeles or, and around our own routine, so I'm a big fan of it and I love the food, so it's great,, just eat a lot of food I love in the places where they were originally created, Yeah, sure I went to uh., Barcelona as I said a few months ago and that was mostly because I had a girlfriend who lived there for six or seven months and she asked me to come out again and again, and uh I finally I was at a point in work where I had worked so much for months at the end that I felt like I had earned a break, so I went there for two weeks, and yes, it was one of the healthiest wisest things I've done in a while, so I, mm reminded me once again how important it is for me to at least travel and get out of the world, I'm very extraordinary, I love talking and talking to people., even virtual people, Oop, I lost you., to relax me, listen and play music much I like to read uh I like to, go watch movies uh cook I cook a lot so I enjoy, Cooking around uh my girlfriend and I are uh currently separated by distance around so I haven't seen her for weeks and that can be very uh, Sadly obvious, so I'll talk to her as much as I can, but yeah, just uh, Um uh pretty simple tastes, yep, This is embarrassing is not, To me I don't really have a lot of temperament so uh very good I guess I'm not getting really easily or quickly angry and uh, when I do it, I'm usually aware enough that I can, somehow formulate how I feel and why I feel so and what, I want to do it, so it's nice., I guess I'm a pretty loose guy in this respect, To be honest, it was probably a small thing, like, Uh wrongly remembers when uh, something was done or like a date on something or like a fact was probably nothing emotionally heated, and it was just about yes, I think it was probably about like, try to figure out exactly when we went to San Francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as the other person, thinking the other person wrong remember so to know in you small or big situation it is very difficult for me to feel really angry, Uh I think in the classical sense of the word, To <sigh>, I'm trying to think that I'm not one who regrets it., I just did a project., like a movie and uh the subject had a little to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to publish it, I pointed out that I didn't want to send it directly to her because I didn't want her to think it was me., does to xxx her face, but I sent it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see things and I want to, Uh maybe that <tha> she could have misunderstood that as passive-aggressive, I don't know about, But yes, I mean, that's something I've been thinking about, but I don't regret it as much as maybe I could have just left it., Uh everyone else I wasn't sure if I should trip, unlike me it to them so, only my thoughts there, The hardest decision I've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh>, Uh, it was actually probably uh likely that uh, ah I wasn't even making a hard decision with as I said with that same ex-girlfriend I mentioned that it was probably hard because uh I knew I had to uh, Break up with her after something happened and, It was difficult because I took great care of them, but it wasn't difficult to come to the conclusion that I was, Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,, Enough with her, but at the same time it wasn't uh, the easiest thing that somehow goes through this process to get on a roller coaster that you are very aware of how mm will be terrible or frightening it, but you know you have to hit the roller coaster so uh so yeah, I'd say that's probably from new memory, I was just..., a plethora of <Laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the best person for me so, as I said it was a it was I didn't have to uh I didn't have to weigh too much data to find out it was pretty clear signs and I have no regret about doing it now to, - I don't know., yes I feel very strong then about it and I still felt very strong that I made the right choice now, around <sigh> it may be, it can be hard, there are <b> they will make me feel it's either when I've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know I've started to train again, which is a great help, But I would say that when I go to bed at night, I never know how it's going to happen sometimes, sometimes I wake up in an hour after sleep and I can't sleep again or, I'm just gonna get up and get up regularly, so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks, but uh yeah, like I said, especially with my current girlfriend uh not around, like I said, she's a very, great source of comfort around like this uh around but she travels a lot for work, so it's something to have to adapt and uh, Uh sleep can be some that suffers from it, but uh in the same way I'm not someone who actually feels like I don't need too much sleep i, if I can get, if I can get four to six hours, I'm in pretty good shape on that day so, um, Uh little timid I guess uh little more <mo> more just around, Whenever I get out of a task, there's always the question of what I am, what's next, and I don't have the next one., To project set up, so it's always that nervousness around in the past something usually comes, so you can set the precedent of it usually works, but until it does, you are getting a little, um, Uh anxious and it can be depressing because it's like uh, You know that I have chosen a lifestyle that, while I have a lot of control and autonomy over my life, also weighs everything on me to do it, and you know, sometimes I'm around I'm very jealous of, the idea that people are just waking up going out into an office for eight hours and don't have to think about this work as soon as they leave the office and somehow the dynamics of a, Group of people or enterprises, You wear it when it's a little hard while like me when I have a day off or when I'm a sick day to get no job done <Laughter> You know I'm a small company that has an employee, How can I handle this?, You..., I suppose you mean, I guess,, uh, People I work with, how I work with the, uh maybe the better answer would be how to cope with this lifestyle and just I've gotten a lot more used to it, something that I'm still learning and finding how to, how to use uh as far as I don't just know how rewarding the work is when I do it, but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live life and, You know how I uh what is the appropriate way to budget finance, which is the, uh expectation I should have for myself in a certain year, which is realistic, which is hopeful uh and that's something I'm sure to take years and years, but I feel as long as I'm getting better, then it is the progress right, Uh yeah uh definitely once and then probably me if I had gone back uh, I had gone to high school, probably it would have been the second time, but yes, I was once diagnosed with depression, so I feel it's one of those things I have to keep an eye on., All my life, you know, I feel like a pretty happy person for most of it, but around uh, they have I hate as annoying as it is, but as they say, like with people who are very creative or people who tend to do a lot of stuff with the mind it is, and I understand that it's a self-esteem thing because it's so hard to feel, To get so hard <har> or so easy I should think <shou> into your own head that, That was within a year, so I probably felt, Uh symptoms were there before it was somehow easy to figure out how ah you know it somehow happened again so I feel uh the symptoms again uh, and to go through these emotions and feel like I was okay in the beginning I had somehow hoped that it would be something I could work through myself, But I realized it was just stupid for me to try the fight alone, so I went and see a therapist, Uh uh really bad that's when I just couldn't sleep at all as if I might get an hour's sleep one night best around I wasn't sleeping at all, had just no <sigh> uh no drive to do anything, whether it was as easy as brushing teeth or, my apartment things like to clean this and just at the same time to be aware that it's like oh that's all in my head and it's not even like a, a symptom around, Uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression, No, I'm just done. I mean, since I didn't graduate or anything, but I got to a point where I was like..., um, I talked through as much as I could talk through and, I had moved on to other places in my life, it was kind of good., good work xxx especially as I said I was working on something I was really interested in I am now with someone I am very interested in, and um, there's such a possible opportunity for me not even to worry about the symptoms and so much, now that, Uh I felt like therapy wasn't necessary and also I just didn't really have the time to go with so much work so, Oh, I definitely think you can have someone you can trust who isn't your boyfriend or family member who isn't, You know, have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or something like that is definitely something beneficial I can't imagine how someone could not benefit from that on a somewhat routine basis, To <sigh>, I don't know that I'm a company <f> a kind of solid creditor that all these things like the things that can somehow haunt you are also for a reason like uh, My sister died when I was about twelve years old and she was younger than me., And watching my parents see my father crying for the first time was a very, Kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh I felt like I grew up a lot on that day, so it's also hard to see that and see how my parents had to deal with the loss of a child, I don't want to forget these things because I think they're very integral to, How I cope with life and how I perceive uh, Having difficulties and obstacles and the image of knowing my father on it is very human, because it is so simple, somehow, You idolize your parents, and I still adore my father, but to know that he's a guy like me, and when I get older, it's easier to deal with, The man he is, So I'd be 16 or 6, um, I like the idea that they always say you wouldn't worry about what people thought about you when you realize how much people didn't think about you, and that's really hard to tell a sixteen-year-old, and I don't know what it means to tell a six-year-old., But yes, I feel special when you're in high school until it's time for me to think you're living in Los Angeles today., so much is trapped in how people think about you and I'm still very much when I find someone anyway is either upset about me or don't like it bothers me to a large extent or I hate to let people down so, I would like to come to a healthier place where only know that sometimes you just can't really control, as people think about you, even if you have the best intentions in the world so, I'm a very compassionate guy, I'm here for my friends, I'm pretty selfless in this respect., To have a good humor about things like having <Laughter> even with depression or depression I can joke about it's not you know I'm not morbid, Depresses more only that I'm aware when I'm uh, I'm low and uh I treat it as such and, I don't know, I'm not trying to deny it, I'm not trying to like any of it, but I..., I've got a I'm a I'm a pretty, like practical person in this respect I don't think uh even though I'm depressed, I don't take it from people or I don't think people have told me that they don't even seem when I, mention that <Cough> has gone through like depression no one seems to like or don't mention it, I feel like if I go through it it's as oh everyone can just say and, I'm just a smoking gun., sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no I tend to wear it pretty well and uh, I don't lose eyes of uh, reality <rea> the reality of what I know happens so, mm, I was on a..., my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to Spain for two, but she cancelled this trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and around, Yes I know I <Laughter> I love her she's great around her is the coolest person I know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh, So we got them for ten days and we just had how normal we get rarely normal couples time, as it always is, how oh I see you for five days and, Then one of us has to go somewhere to be normal for ten days, where we can just cook at home., lying in bed reading books or something was great and uh it makes me so happy that I have, Someone I can do this with and it feels so practical and feels so right, um, I guess for xxx I'm a good guy like I know I know I don't know uh, I don't think I'm kidding people, I'm not a good friend to have, I'm there for people I'm looking for people I care about., uh about people and what they think about me and that's especially true for my friends and, I'm trying to make sure you know with a lot of my friends on the east coast I'm trying to carve time to make sure they know that I'm thinking about them and I'm calling them, and so I feel like uh for many people who am me as their friend, Probably one of their better in the sense that I know how much I appreciate and respect the friendships we have., Thank you, Ellie., See you.",9
374,"Yes, pretty good, alexandria virginia, mhm, I moved to I_a., End of two thousand one, Yes, it's crazy <Laughter>, um, a few times a year usually like for holidays, It's very different., I think it's much softer, Um, it's much more like suburban., It's nice., there's something comforting about it, but it's always like I'm getting a little restless when I'm there and looking forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>, I went to college in U_s_c., It wasn't bad, I mean my program that I was in., was so intense that, as for the first year, it was all consumed so that I really didn't have much free time to think about the adjustment, it was just like I was <Laughter> my life wasn't my own so, That did it somehow, to easier I appreciate and also I was like in a community of people I knew with so automatically I knew people and you know friends and so, It wasn't bad., Film, One day I had a revelation, I was no longer undergraded., I was kind of a little flundering I didn't really know what I wanted to do, and, just one day I was kind of like you know what I'm really excited about what I'm really passionate about, and, I realized that movies are the thing I love the most and I'm most passionate about it, so I decided to go to film school., a little yes and no it's not me I'm so <s> I'm like in a little transition at the moment, but yeah as in recent years I've produced uh like freelance producer <sniffle>, So this is the question of the moment <laughter> around, I think that uh, I don't necessarily have a job title that's my dream job, but I know it's kind of, What's that?, I want and because basically as I live a freelance lifestyle for a while and I know this is how exhausting and I don't want to do that anymore, so I'm looking for something that's stable, You know, full time, nice benefits and I definitely want to stay in the entertainment industry, um, and I like to know what I love about producing is that it's just like there are constant challenges and you don't know anything about it., what will be thrown at you that I, that you know that it is always interesting and exciting, So I'm trying to figure out what a good one would be right now., To be a place for me where I can reasonably be challenged and you know have a kind of, as space to grow and advance and all this, Yeah, that's good., I can't see your shoes., I like to travel around, I don't know that I haven't done much lately, but I've known you in the past,, a fair amount paid, um, I love the adventure of only you know new experiences new places new people, I think it's just good to get out of your little island world and see what's out there, and you just know it., see, Beautifully remarkable, Places and things and simply experience different ways of life and different languages and cultures <sniffle>, um, Let's see, I went to Costarica a few years ago., um, my best friend from growing up she and I went for like ten days and it was likely that, this could be like my, Favorite trip of all time <Laughter> as if it was really awesome, but <Laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful, um, and we just spent like, we went to three different places and to explore just a lot and how sightseeing we walked a ton, which was amazing, and then like the last place we landed was this little beach town, so it was at this point as if we felt like you know that we had done all this like amazing physical effort, like Ziplines and all these walks, so that when we came to the beach, it was like, We deserve the right to step back and relax., It hit everyone from the, You know it as fed this kind of desire for adventure and activity around but it also, I'm also a great fan of vacation where you just like veg out and relax and how to lie on a beach with a book so it somehow hit everything, What do I do to relax?, I mean, depending on where I am, like when it is, you know if I'm like at work or something, and I'm stressed out, I'm just gonna..., you know, take a minute and breathe just like really deep and try to calm me down, um, When I'm home, I might like it., you know, throw on a movie or like a t_v show that I really like and only that gives a feeling of how, Type of escape relief, Pretty good, I don't mean, It takes a lot to make me very angry, it doesn't happen very often., um, The last time I had a fight with someone, my mother was <Laughter> and it was about money <Laughter> <Depth Breath>, um, I felt really frustrated because I felt like she was, how to judge me unjustly, and that was disturbing, Yes <Laughter>, um, It's good, uh you know they live all over the country from me so I don't see them often, but as I usually talk to, my mom on the phone probably like once in the week and, my parents are really supportive <sigh> around, they are, You know how when I go home to see how I enjoy I enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time, So I'd say we have a pretty, Pretty good relationship, I guess because I'm like that., Type of work Hunting, Phase I feel guilty sometimes that I don't like, do enough you know how there are times when there are like days where maybe like I should have, sent a few more summaries or more things as I feel guilty sometimes for not how productive enough <sniffle>, Usually it's pretty easy the last few weeks as was atypical as not as good, I'm not sure I haven't figured it out yet., But I just had more, uh, like nights, in which, either, takes me a really long time to go to sleep or I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason, um, I also have a lot like really strange intense dreams that wake up like me sometimes I wake up myself sometimes <laughter> because I'm talking, which is weird <laughter> the so yes, it's just I don't know, not that I was able to identify, I mean, I think maybe I'm more stressed than usual just because I'm doing my job situation like, in the river, but, I don't know that there was no similar event., I appreciate good sleep, and I'm used to it, so it's just not good., Feeling, um, not really no, Yes, To <sigh>, as < sigh>, I think in how, October or November, Although this is actually the second time that it happened in my life, but the first time was like, many years ago <sniffle>, um, I felt like I was, a really low and how too low for me to free me from, To <sigh>, just a hard time, Work on the most fundamental, Level as only, Get up and, in a shower, and go to the grocery store, And you know, Answering e-mails was just like, It took so much energy, um, So yeah, I just wasn't really, Normal working, Yeah, that's good., Yes, Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah., <Laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall I would say, so, < deep breath> I think that the therapy, is good for me because it, helps me to open up, my kind of patterns..., and also like, ah, just how to observe how I am like reaction to certain situations and just think it's < deep breath> it gives me a more elevated like kind of self-consciousness around, so that unlike just like, um, Kind of just react to situations I'm like, mm, just as if I noticed more what's going on around, and it just helps,, um, I don't know it's just helpful <Laughter> I don't really know <real> I don't really know how to explain it <Laughter>, # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# # # # # # # # #, I don't know., I can't think of <Laughter> I can't think of anything <sharp inhale>, Oh, maybe about uh, about Christmas at home with my family, Yeah, that's good., um, Well, it was just, It was like I just started getting out of my depression., and, as you know, I live alone here I have a dog, but so I only had a long time of, Feeling, not, <Laughter> Great and easy to do everything alone and somehow wish my family was around me, um, So, when I was with them, it was just..., It just felt very much like, safe and comfortable and just as you know it, warm family hug, To <sigh>, <Laughter> I think she'd call me, funny, and smart, and, um, a good listener, Not legally binding, um, I don't know that <Laughter> enough <Laughter>, All right., so, this happened, the last like, Job I had I mean I was it wasn't technical I was a freelancer, but I worked for this company for how, one and a half years almost two years and uh, I had a very small company, the boss had a really good relationship with my boss, and he's kind of pissed off., he's kind of out of nowhere, uh, mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and around, essentially as, the agreement we had is that he would pay me like a monthly holder for my services and then I would get paid fees per project, So he liked to put me on this conversation and was like you know our big customer who's like you know the bread and butter of the company that they really cut back, as you probably notice that things are getting really slow and I was like yeah, And he's like I'm gonna stop paying you for your hold., and that was a total surprise, but I was fine and he went on to talk like, he, I would still have the right to the first rejection of all the projects that came through the door and you know because that he seemed like you know, Even if I didn't get the Retainer anymore, He would still throw me enough work, as if I didn't know it wasn't like a drama., Decline in the amount of money I made <Cough> excuse me, But um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work that I love to work with you, you're fantastic, yada yada so, To make a long story short, what happened then, that he fired me., Um, and he was his way of pushing me out of the company and letting me go because from then on,, he stopped calling me, he stopped e-mailing me., and later like a few months down the street, I had to go back to the office because there were some projects that still, running like the customer took a really long time to get back with their notes and when I was there, I saw that around, This guy who, had worked with us a number of similar, If we needed another producer, like if we were beaten, we would get him to do something else., He did my job like that., Yeah, so it's just like, It was a real <rea> <laughter> it was a really crappy way of getting fired without being told that I was fired around and it was just like, that uh the reason I want if I could erase that is out of my mind because I don't really think of another situation that makes me feel as angry and frustrated and just like, in a way that, that, although this was as you know a few months ago, feels very unresolved and makes me somehow like, angry when I think about it, so yeah that was a very long explanation, but that's what I want <Laughter>, # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

just go out and get them instead of sitting back and waiting for opportunities to imagine, hmm <sigh> um, probably just a few of the, Relationships I Formed With People, um, Just like really, you know deep friendships, You're welcome., See you.",2
375,"Yes, Good, It was a nice day., the South Bay, I can also ask you this question., Oh, all right., That's where I'm basically, but like the South Bay of, I didn't want to move much anyway., just to get a change everyone thinks l_a is like, all it is the best, but, There are too many people and too much traffic, I can't see your shoes., drive and see new things, last year I went to sacramento, from here and, stayed for like a month living in my v_w bus with my wife it was somehow a cool camping, just wanted to have fun something else, Article No, Not at all., Probably do what you do, I'm really interested in finding new ideas and things., Outward, I haven't done much lately to relax, but I like the beach, Good, I argued with my brother about him last night., Speak to me with more respect, as a person, I was crazy and I wanted to fight, It's good, but sometimes they're just, They are too entangled in what they do to pay attention to other people's feelings., like with my brother he's just, He's just tense about his situation, and he tried to brush it off on me., Wasting money because I'm married now, Yeah, I'm not., something like probably take some candy out of the store, no no, Taking money from my mother when I was really young, Because they, Well, I was like in junior high school and, I think I took like twenty out of her purse and bought candy for my friends and, I felt guilty even though on the same day, probably yes, that was probably the beginning of my stupid activities, my whole life or in the last few years, my wife, I'm married to her., We've known each other for two years., I met her on an art walk, she also went to u_s_c, the last few days have been, kind of hard, but I usually go to sleep well, I think I'm kind of snappy < sn> I think I'm snappy, Positively optimistic, Yeah, that's good., I've been thinking more positive lately., and I want to put a lot of things into action, so I tried to train my mind in, I know that stuff's coming to me., in conversation with the universe, Simple if you just try and do it, Everyone has a ghost, no, no, No, I just told you I felt positive., I was happy yesterday <yester> I was happy yesterday because I know that I made some good decisions, want to be positive and stay away from negative people, Being alive, Know God, I don't know., I don't know I can't think of anything right now., I don't think I can have one., Gender, Exercise, Wake up positive and a good meal in the morning, I think I'm going to Sacramento., no, Don't smoke cigarettes and see how you spend your money, you will sell my ideas and my uh <Laughter>, Thoughts, I can't think of that right now.",5

walking along the beach I live only a few blocks away from the beach, so it's easy, no, Not at all, just not interested uh I was on mexico a few times when I was younger, went to Ensenada, but except that I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what has happened lately, To go abroad, around <Laughter> actually child psychology and I was in the care program for a little, but I had some problems at home, which caused me to get out, Oh, that's all right., (a) the value of the goods in question shall be equal to or less than the value of the goods in question;, um, I don't have any., to be honest around, I admire people who do the job they love, I mean like football players who like to play football, and they get all the money paid, how big is that <Laughter>, so, I'm pretty intrusive when I meet someone first., To say, if we want to, continue to communicate with the person or not, and once I have decided that I like this person or whatever I talk a lot, so, Yes, um, I like watching movies, I like reading, but lately my concentration wasn't that big, so it's hard to get into a good book, not good in times I uh I have a, some breakout every time in a while so anyway it depends on how angry I get, Yesterday, and it was with my partner, and, To be honest, I don't know what it was anymore, it's just, Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and I don't appreciate it and when I feel that I'm disrespectful or whatever I'm going to stand up for myself, so, um, Sometimes some people can be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and I say what I am, what is in my mind, I don't know., deliberately go and hurt people's feelings or anything of this nature, but, I'm not being bullied and I'm not being made to not return when I feel like I'm being challenged, so, um, My mother died last year., so, I wish I could've done it differently., um, It stirs up <ups> it upsets me, so, It's okay., Let me see., Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., I think I'm going to pass this on, too, because it's getting me more upset, so <Laughter>, that's sometimes awful uh sometimes actually falling asleep can be no problem, especially you know when you're done working and doing everything you had to do in a day, you're tired, But staying asleep is a completely different thing for me, because, It's like I can't uh, I get up and then I'm awake I'm going to the living room turn the t_v and watch t_v I'm lucky when I sleep three to four hours, Maybe because I have a lot in my mind., uh you know, think about bills and, and, the stressiness of the work and then all the other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it, It's not hard, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes to overtime mode, it just affects everything your concentration your sleep your food, Everything like this, I'm a little grouchy especially in the morning I'm not a morning man <Laughter>, I like the nights, but I don't like the morning, it's like leaving me alone until I get my first cup of coffee, Yeah, that's good., so different from the, I'm, I'm fine., Well, I was depressed., for some time, and I still have difficulties <diff> difficulty, Because after my mother's death four months later my uncle died, So I've had two deaths last year, so I'm still wavering and trying to, to get back together, I'm just recently I've started to pursue like interests that I used to do, that I haven't done in a year because of what happened, Um, I'm just..., I could get angry a little easier I sleep a lot I eat too much I eat too much, um, I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep, so sometimes it's hard, it seems like I'm fighting to get through the day, Yes, I have a psychiatrist who prescribes me medication on a regular basis., oh I was diagnosed some time ago hm probably, Ten to fifteen years ago, and it's just something I never have, I don't know if or not, You can, so I've always taken the medicine., um, I was, fight with each of my family my friends and so and me, was desperate and hopeless, and I had tried to take my own life years ago, What took me to the hospital, And then uh, They started treating me, I started seeing a therapist, so, Well, right now, I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance covers the psychiatrist and not the therapist., but I work with a friend of mine who <ha>, Ways to go to seek help for a therapist and I don't know if this will really help me, I mean at some point it depends on what kind of therapist you sometimes just sit people there, And they just listen to you when you talk and go on and you think, my God, what's good is that?, and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback, how to deal with emotions, Tools to help you deal with your emotions, so, um, as I said, I didn't go to therapy recently just psychiatrists just medications, um, There were no real changes., I would probably do well because I did well before my mother died, I was her nurse, and uh, even if many times i, I felt overwhelmed or, missing <l> uh missing patience with her, uh, I was still much happier., when I am now, so, um, Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., I'd say when my son was born years ago, I'm not a parent anymore, he died., so, um, and that was also difficult, uh, hmm, around I am extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me, Because I get everything done that I should be done, although sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained, and, You know, these qualities are admirable in people who can keep their word and be responsible, Excuse me., Oh, I have a lot of regret for, Things I've done in the past that I'm not too happy about, But you know I met someone once in my life., that had this saying and you see it on a bumper sticker, uh, live to never regret, So you know you can't go back and make changes, it's too late, so why you know you have the situation., but sometimes it's a lot easier said than done, To I'm not the advice somehow getting person <Laughter> I know I don't really know, give my friends every advice I can, I find most of the times people don't listen to you, so why bother, um, I'm just saying my opinion, that's all., I'm on a diet because I ate too much., After my mother died, I was much thinner than she was alive., I just went crazy with the food and a lot of sleeping, You know that sleep eat sleep eat, and now I'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight, because it's very unhealthy for me, um, hmm, I'm trying to believe it's been a long time., Actually, there's nothing, because, Now I just keep my thoughts busy, I haven't been in a movie in ages, I haven't gone shopping all the time., um, So it's been a long time since it's been so long., I was content and happy with who I am and what I do in my life., around my weekends Saturday <sa> uh like Saturday I usually work, around Sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house, um, running some errands going shopping for food, You know that., so, It's not that if I was younger, you know, it would be fun to do clubbing or whatever, but I'm too old for it now., xxx, um, There's nothing I can imagine., there's nothing I can be proud of, hmm, um, some a good like comedy or whatever I like to see that around, sometimes my partner could do something stupid I like, 'Cause I like to make fun of him, um, But mm only that's what you know, go maybe go for a walk on the beach, that's it, All right., No problem, thank you., See you.",12
377,"Yeah, come on., I'm fine., I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a little and then I lived abroad for a little while then I moved to California, mhm, I moved here at the end of June last year, so I guess it was eight months ago that there was such a thing., To <sigh>, Most likely twice a year, To <sigh> it's a good question, I've always wanted to live in California, but I had lived in the central coast around, and, I had just come to l_a as once a month for various business and network and personal development things so, Yeah, things changed., in santa cruz for me the customer I had who was really the most important as financial, um, Main source of finance I had that relationship ended, so I was totally free to move and I thought, well I think I'll give l_a a try and see what happens so, So I gave it a chance and here I am, Oh not at all <Laughter> It's a very big city around, I lived in Dublin in Ireland it was one that is also a big city, but, As you know, European cities are much more dense and public transport is much easier to use., and, Yeah, so just getting around here and getting acquainted with the city was pretty challenging and uh, Yeah, that's good., so, I love to travel I love it yes I have lived in Ireland and I traveled around, I was in morocco and I was in costa rica, I spent some time in Mexico, so..., Yeah, that's good., to meet i love <sigh> new people who experience new cultures and how, not only see what is different, but see what is similar among people everywhere you go, To be sure, good., I guess..., I'm trying to think what my favorite was I mean anyway there were amazing things about Morocco and Costa rica both but, Morocco was incredible, it was like twelve days and we went to three different places that we found in the Atlas Mountains that are beautiful and uh, Yeah, it's a really cool culture, so it was fun., um <sigh> my trip to Ireland I actually visited there, which is why I decided to move there, so, my most memorable moment of this trip, I mean, there are probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of this trip was, To be on a bus and go, to dublin and go only to the country and, see how absolutely stunningly beautiful it is I mean, it's everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you know you see it in movies and it's green and lush and beautiful, but, when you actually get there and experience it, it's like the pictures don't do it right, so it was incredible, Yeah, that's good., um i have a degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women's studies, No I use my English and psychology to work in marketing communication so, I'm actually doing sales, So yes, psychology definitely comes into play., comes into play and anyway does my, I guess my undergrade in English, but really how I accepted that and created something out of it because most people who only teach an English degree and I didn't want to teach, um, to, I'm not quite sure about the question., All right., Wow around <sigh>, You know my dream job is, as a, a motivational speaker and trainer and trainer, to travel the world, to do so and to influence people's lives, and, To make a real contribution to people, around my relationship is pretty good actually i, I just fixed my relationship with my biological mother who, She wasn't sporadic I saw her grow up sporadic I lived my father pulled me and then he married my stepmother and, They had two children together, so I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with, but I talked to my biological mother., Um, last May and we were, We know that things have been cleared up and have been in communication ever since., um, Well, I don't know what moment you mean, but if you mean to be in communication with my biological mother, um, I mean, it was very liberating to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and anyway not only the future, but in the present moment with it so, Yeah, that's good., I'm shy., To relax, I do a number of things that I like to do yoga, although I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance., I love to read, I love to go into the ocean spending time just staring at the waves and soaking all these negative ions, which really recharges my battery, probably more than anything else, um, I like being with friends around, I love art and, Try new restaurants around, Yeah, all these things are, both relaxing anyway I think they relax in the sense that, I feel connected with the people in my life and with the experiences of my life so, Yeah, that's right., depends on whether I'm not driving very well, but otherwise I'm pretty good at it <Laughter>, To <sigh> Last time I argued with someone, it should probably be, Oh no, it was with the l_a times about newspaper delivery, Yeah, that was the last time., Yes, the <sigh>um the newspaper that should appear for the elderly lady I care for, It didn't show up., and, I didn't know it was just there., Um, late, I don't know, afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called her and, They said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning, which was absurd to me when they made the mistake at all., So I mean for a service we pay for every day, so, um, it was really irritable and then I found out that, the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and had not been communicated with me, so, I was angry at the times when I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and had not told me that I was quite frustrated., Oh wow there are quite a lot of them around, let me think about one, Um, I had a call the other day., and I'm in a coaching program and, It was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program, And she explained to me that there was an additional call that we would meet every week, and then we also have coaching calls because we have a specific trainer we work with., and then she called to tell me that I had another coaching call with, um, Someone who's not my coach and uh that, had not been explained to me as part of the program so that at that moment it seemed to me just like oh my God I have all this, People I have to be accountable to and I'm like anyway you know I have to, not only be accountable to them, but share private things that happen in my life with these people and it was just I don't know, so, Yeah, I wasn't..., I wasn't angry I was just feeling frustrated and a little overwhelmed at this moment and, You know, and I talked her out of it, and we've been through it, but..., um, Yeah, I could have done it., sure was just okay with what was asked by me at that time and, I would have made the call much smoother., The hardest decision there was was a few., I guess moving to Ireland was probably the toughest decision, No, it wasn't even the hardest decision, it was such a simple decision, but telling my family about it was, challenging, But the hardest decision was my first time that I, Moved, uh away from my family I was twenty-eight and I decided I decided to move to Colorado, And that was a pretty tough decision, because then my family was, You know, within an hour drive from wherever I lived for an hour and a half and now you'll know,, Around a twelve hour drive or an airplane ride away, so it was difficult, Oh, many things..., I loved colorado colorado is a beautiful and beautiful condition, the weather is so much better than wisconsin and around, at the time I was very much in rock climbing, and there is only a huge outdoor community in Colorado, so there were a lot more people who, To be in my age group and or single that was another factor around, and were interested in the things I was interested in, so Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit, so, Yes and then I found a job I liked the pay was cruel, but, I found some work that was really rewarding and so everything came together and I decided to move, Yeah, that's good., That was a completely independent question about <sigh>, relatively light, It just depends on how long I go to sleep when I'm outside and I don't come home until eleven thirty, You know, then I go to bed too late and uh I wake up on feeling tired as I feel today, but usually I can sleep through the night I had some pretty, Fear paralyzed dreams over the last few weeks, but even if I wake up from them or if I know I can move from them, I can still fall back relatively easily to sleep, Yeah, I'm sure they're I mean, I'm in another transition state from which I'm moving out, From the house where I live, where I take care of an elderly woman., Yeah, and I just need to find, the financial means to support me and it is, and she creates a lot of fear just in her state of being she is exhausting and totally depressing, so, Yeah, that's good., To live with her is pretty hard, as if it was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done, and I would never do it again if I were honest, if I knew what I was getting into, I don't think I would have said yes to the situation., I feel trapped and helpless, like you don't know anything I can do., There's no way out of the situation that I don't care what I do, it doesn't get better I don't know that I don't get any kind of work I want to do, And my money doesn't work at all., So yeah, it feels pretty crappy, <Laughter>Thank you, I've been in the past, yes, Oh a long time I was fifteen I think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago, I was suicidal., Oh, yeah, I feel like I'm down there, I don't really know no, um, I stopped originally., with my therapist because we had finished, I mean, we had, worked on what had to be worked and I was no longer depressed, and then I started the therapy again, Later, I think I was in my early thirties., And then we ended this because I moved to Ireland, so..., Yes, I mean, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention as I don't think in therapy oh I'll be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years I think that's ridiculous, I think you're going to therapy to work on a particular problem and have a solution and someone who's your soundboard can see things you can't see., and, You know, work through this situation and come with..., a strategy for, not only that not only the creation of a solution in this area, but also the creation of strategies, and uh tools for the rest of your life so you don't have to be in therapy forever, Deep breath the last time I felt really happy, What are you doing?, Wow, that's pretty sad, It's been at least a year., No, that's not true., If I, saw my biological mother who was last May, my best qualities, To <sigh>, I'm very strong, very strong-willed, i um, I am very supportive and loving and caring, um, I'm just being here, I'm intelligent., and, um, Yeah, that's good., everything I regret, I don't think so., no, Don't take life too seriously, Oh, my ideal weekend, I spend some time on the beach, I spend some time with friends, either go out in the evening in a movie, or, I'm just going out to..., a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together, To maybe go dancing later, And on Sundays I usually go to, Scrubbed_entry, And then I got brunch with friends and, um, Yeah, I'm going home and Sunday night I'm getting ready for the next day so, hmm <sigh>, I'm very proud of, um, a few things I mean, I moved to places I wanted to move to., and so I have done things that have really spoken to me and have, Meaning something you know that I loved the heart to actually do it., um, mm reach those who:, Objectives or objectives, Yes, I did things I wanted to do, like move to Ireland and move to California., mhm, All right., safe, See you.",16
378,"Yes, pretty good, I grew up in Boston, About thirty years ago, yep, not too often, Maybe once a year sometimes less, Oh, I love living in l_a, I never want to live anywhere else, Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and, the weather was good and, That's part of it., very simple, good maybe something easy the beginning of the first few weeks was really hard, just being in a new environment and being away from everyone I knew, but after a few weeks it was great, Radio journalism, Well, it's something I've wanted to do since I was 12., and all I did from the time I was twelve until I went to college was somehow in pursuit of this dream, No <Laughter>, Well, it's kind of a long story, but I was fired from my first job when I was, in my twenties, and, It's just, Once I had done this work, I realized that this is not really what I wanted to do, it was also, It just wasn't suitable for me, it didn't make me happy., yep < sigh>, my dream job works with football players and helps them to recover from concussion and other injuries, <deep breath> good the work itself is not very hard I'm very good at what I do the hard part is to find the right people and work the connections with them, it, I'm not so much on the road anymore., I love to see different places and different things like I love to go to places that don't like, where I come from, my favorite trip is that I was in Australia for my thirtieth birthday., Because I wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday when I crossed the international date limit., and I went to this really small place on the, Uh West Coast of Australia called Shark Bay, where native dolphins live and swim, and is for the most part very isolated and I have to be there for a whole week and only really a lot of myself, with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you, and it's amazing just a beautiful place in the world, more shy <sigh>, < deep breath> why < sigh> hm that's a good question around, The first thing I think about is because I've always been like this., But maybe that's an excuse I don't know., I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than many people, So [sighing], I'm looking at a lot of t_v <sigh>, or that's probably not the best alternative, but it's something I do, and I also go to the beach because I live near the beach, so that's one of my favorite things to relax, #

379,"Yes, I feel okay little tired but for the most part feels pretty good, I'm actually originally from forest hills that I was born in the San Fernando Valley, and then I moved to lomita, which is in loose circle, ca. mm probably by nineteen ninety three so I mean I'm now twenty-three so, It's about what yeah nineteen years or so I've lived there yeah, some things I really like, I'd have to say, you know,, the beach, You know., not so much traffic doesn't really care about it, but it does., In any case, you know exactly how the nightlife is., just people in general I like talking to others so yeah, Right, yep, Yeah, actually, I mean, I can't see your shoes, but, um, actually, I travel a lot, I was in places like Hawaii., was on the Caribbean, I was seeing at uh times <machte sound with mouth>, You only know different places like, Arizona, I was in Oregon Washton., pretty everywhere I would say so but usually especially as to hawaii and the caribbean mexico so, yep <free throat>, I think it's just the experience you know as if you couldn't experience culture., to different people you only know the whole background of the landscape, It's just that you know it's something new to experience, I'd say, something you know that people haven't seen yet, so, Well, let's see, I recently made a trip to Hawaii a few months ago, which was back in December it was Christmas time, new years so that was pretty fun we went to a few different islands, We went to uh see, I think it was Kauai going to oahu, uh maui You know places like this so, yep, You know I'd have to say that, around you probably know like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean you know, just like I said before the whole experience factor, just look around you know new different things things that are unique so, Yeah, that's good., I'm studying journalism right now, I'm in my last semester, So I'm over <bout> until graduation couple of months, yep, Well, you know, it's kind of funny because you know that I started a two-year community college at a... you know., And so you know, I went into uh like business management know something to do with you, I think, < Thin> basically about accounting, But I thought it wasn't for me., So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't say that I would probably still be sitting at a desk, but, You know, at least with journalism, I can go to the field and you know, talk to people, and you know,, Arta you know, get information collecting information that Arta Deal and then you know write stories, I just thought it was you know it was much more interesting to me, unlike you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so, yep, My dream job, I'd have to say you know something on the radio show., Sport transmission, you know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine., so, my relationship with my family it's pretty good you know I'm still living with my parents, as I said, I am twenty-three years old, There are times when it can be a little shaky, a little stony, but..., For the most part, it's pretty good that you know I've matured a lot in recent years., Things are, uh, you know, I'd say things are going pretty well., You know, I think it's coming somewhere in the middle, You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and relaxed, other times I somehow it's not as much as I go into my bowl, but, You know sometimes how I can be kind of shy when I don't know people so well or when I've never met them before, So it's one of those things that somehow you have to meet me in the middle of it, because you know,, I can either talk very talkatively, or sometimes you know I can be a little shy, but you know, once I get this conversation started, I'm pretty talkative and, so, Um, you usually know, um..., I would listen to music, or maybe you just know that you're kind of going on a ride, Or you know you're hanging out with my friends, you just know something to know somehow., Lightness that you know because you know how I said, sometimes you get a bit tense and you just want to relax and you know only the things you enjoy, so, You know I was really better with it., A few years ago, you know that I, There were points where I could pretty much not control my temperament, however, as <li> I mean, I would just, pretty angry at you know the smallest things that everything would just tick me off somehow, but, You know, I definitely learned, uh you know, control over this kind of thing, And you know it made me a better person because it burns my throat., Well, let's see, I'm trying to think it was probably something with my family with my mother, maybe it's I can't remember from the top of my head, but, You know, it's always something so miniscule that, That's probably why I don't remember., But you know we're gonna make up for this sometime, and I apologize because you know I accept that., You know I'm wrong under certain circumstances., Yeah, that's good., something I feel guilty about, Maybe you know that I'm not as nice to others as I could have been in the past, you know, and that's the past, and you know, I don't like staying in this way, but I think this is one thing that I've tried to work on, but it's also one thing that I regret somehow, not just do, just be nice, The hardest decision I ever had to make uh it was pretty new, a little hard because I actually have a buddy who was in the Luftwaffe and he recently, diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia, so that was really hard, And it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not quite there the way he used to be., So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm ignoring him and I don't want to do that, but at the same time I don't know his tendencies., He could be a little bit., Crazy, so, Maybe you know some kind of traumatic stress disorder, maybe when he was in the military, so I don't know, but yes., Yeah, it's pretty hard, you know, because we've been back a long time., were best friends with him because I was probably about five six years old, So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to handle, but you know, I'm trying to, I don't know., Try to stay in mind, but you know it's always there, I don't forget, so yeah, My best friend, Well, he would probably say that you know I'm a pretty pretty guy., Usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest, but you know I'm trying to work on it too, He'd probably say I'm pretty funny., I like hanging out with you., Mode, Doing things here and there that you only know, normal activities like any other person you know going to the beach hanging out movies that you know grab a few beers that kind of deal so yeah, <freezes the throat, You know, it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know when I'm really tired, you know, I'm probably going to have a very good sleep, I haven't slept so well in the last few days, because you know,, My house, there's workers on the roof, so use the new roof, so it's kind of tough., so that wakes me always early in the morning so sometimes a little crabby, but for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep <empty throat>, lately eh, You've felt pretty good because you know things are starting to look up., I actually did an internship about <bout> a month ago, for you know, my field of journalism, so that's good to graduate in two months, so I'm looking forward to,, To make a little more money, you know that's good, and yes, things are going pretty well right now, I can't complain < clears throat>, Yeah, it's not bad that you know how I said it could always be worse right, but, You know, I enjoy life, so it's the best part, I have not been going on, no, Yes, no, Last time I felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> You know it was probably back to my buddy when you know that he was still, I guess you could say we know he came back to visit the Air Force he had left., So you know we were just hanging out, You know I have a few beers and I'm just talking about life, so it was nice, but I miss you knowing., I felt great that you know, For there is nothing like having a best friend that can be entertained, whom you can know twenty-four seven above all., can tell him everything in confidence, and he could tell me everything in confidence, how, It's hard to find that you especially know someone you've known for so many years, and then you can't really get it back now., Yeah, that's good., Yes, there's one, there's probably one or two things I regret, Well, I mean, I regret having a d_u_i over, Three or four years ago, actually, it was four years ago, so that's something I definitely regret because you know that I look back on it and you know that things might have been different, but at the same time, You have to accept that you know the actions you know., which has taken place, So you know, I'm manned and you know, I think I think I'm better off for it, But at the same time, you know it will always be in the back of your mind, as I said., It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way., Now you know, it's one of those things like <Laughter> I was a kid then, so I really don't know what to say, even though, I would have listened, who knows, but you know that I probably would have told myself that you knew exactly., Be careful, you know., Make sure you can be the best person you may be, um, basically you know, just always be nice honest, to take care only of others, so, to probably get back to my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing, I'm not saying that I wish I could erase it I just wish it didn't happen like this, so, Yeah, that's good., my ideal weekend uh I usually keep it pretty generic I tend to hang out with my friends, Either you know we're hanging out in the day, You know that certain things like you know, maybe grab a few beers, to you know you just have casual entertainment maybe play games movies look you know only the standard stuff that people do this, some things I wish I could change, um, Maybe you just know you're nicer than I said before., um, Maybe not to be so lazy have more determination, I mean, I have a lot of determination, I know what I want to do with my life., But I know there are times when I'm kind of, get a little laxadaisical so I wish I could improve on that and not delay so much, Well, you know, it's hard to think back, but I would probably say a time when someone is making me feel really bad you know, I'd say like if I was you know kind of angry at certain people maybe just kind of chew my friends if I probably shouldn't, I have tried to make more constructive criticisms, but, at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say these kinds of things and, they were out of character, so, my best qualities I would say that I'm definitely working hard I'm sure, I'm very caring now, more than I used to be, very honest, And you know I love talking to people, I like to make new relationships, I like to make people laugh <empty throat>, something I did recently that I really enjoyed, You know, it was probably about my internship, I was just you know I wrote a story or two., and it just felt good that you know these stories are done and eventually they're going to go to the newspaper, so, I feel that way., You know it's one of those things when you're working on something and then you see the product right there, You know it's right in your face, and you can tell yourself that you know how I did it., so, makes me feel good yep, You know, let's just see some different stories., usually things about good the newspaper is in long beach, so it's usually about you stories or events that take place in long beach, so yeah, I'd say I'm very proud that you know the degree., Gymnasium about to graduate from college, hopefully you know obviously that I'm earning a degree and then hopefully you get to know a good solid job, You know in the near future, I think this is one thing I'm most proud of, Thank you.",2
380,"safe, I'm fine., Yeah, that's good., I'm from Maryland., Yeah, that's good., by Maryland Washton d_c Area, Uh like five weeks ago, Maryland around <deep breath> it's a lot it's a lot less around, Uh xxx it's a uh it's not so nice at this time of year it's more about, It's fine, it's nice, it's..., It's much better, but there's a lot more people going on., I'm still getting used to it, so I guess I'm still getting used to it, so..., um, It's, It's not like..., Yeah, I'm still getting used to it coming slowly, but I'm sure., I live in the culver city, I've got one., It's okay, I live in a really nasty house, it's cheap, it's cheap, because I live in a friend's apartment., um, and uh, but and he lets me stay there for half the price, but the actual place itself is quite terrible <horr> terrible living conditions <Laughter> but I'm moving soon, so, I can't see your shoes., uh but no I travel xxx I would say i xxx I probably have more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel to the u_s, but I wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything, I enjoy the chance to see others, To walks of life and and and how to meditate on the, the specificity of my own, They know that the < th> given the parameters I grew up under, how different everyone else is like, how every life is totally around, I also mean just within the u_s like seeing someone grow in California is as different as someone growing in Maryland and then thinking about someone growing up in like Thailand or something it's nice it's pretty amazing, mhm, Uh, okay., hmm, I'm right here Ellie, um, Let's see., uh, Well, um..., It's been a while since I was on a trip, I guess, One of the last trips I made was to, I mean it was a xxx like two years ago I went on road trip over the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing, but I guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> I drove from Maryland to l_a this is before I actually moved here, but to visit new Orleans and new Orleans was just this whole, like, although it's part of the u_s it's like a total, It's completely different than anywhere else, it's so..., unique the culture there is so unique and the mixture of Caribbean and French and all these other influences in as the American South is so, So, um..., Unbelievable, yes, it's just unreal, yes, it's unreal, yes, it's unreal., hmm, It's a difficult question., One <on>um, - I don't know., hmm, You know that I can give you back to this question you are able to, Yeah, that's good., Come back., Yeah, that's good., That's what I just said., Film, You know, that's actually a question I asked myself that I knew I knew., I've had my whole life like phases of interest, so when I was how very very very young I was really in the first phase that I remember were keys and then tools as I go around collecting keys, and then I would go around collecting tool like any kind of tool I had a toolbox my parents told me that I was a phase before that with which balls were like different balls, um, and then I was really in insects that collected insects and reptiles and so and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and, at a certain <cert> and anyway at a certain point I really got killed, like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then eventually in there I had told <to> I remeber someone that at the moment I'm interested in, playwriting and and poetry, but finally I wanted to be interested in uh film, how I could somehow see the trajectory coming, but I don't remember what led me to this conclusion I just always think, I've lived a protected life as far as movies are concerned, I didn't let my parents watch a r-rated movie until I was almost like that in high school., um, and uh and I never, Uh so I never saw a r-rated movie I was also very zimperish as I remember when I was, Pretty young maybe like six I saw star wars, the first scene in darth star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck, and so only a small scene very at the beginning and that like me freaked out and I had to leave the room so, I'm not sure., Yes, it is., I don't know exactly how I got into the movie., but, I've always been fascinated by, how people interact and what you know about acting and so and movies in general, I'm just..., To be a filmmaker to direct, and uh put <pu> joined, and do <ma> as I think directly I don't use mm that word so much because it I think I think it's more than like I want the opportunity to put together and make, Films, Uh or making movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it because I want you to know I want to participate in all, all processes, but, I guess the best parable for that would be a director, Director, It's much better if I don't live with them., um, my, I guess..., It's funny you ask Ellie., I've been thinking a lot about it lately, I think I'm close to my whole family I'm closest with my father around I'm coming with my brother and sister you know how, but I don't, when they're gone, as my brother is in a foreign country at the moment, so I do not have the opportunity to talk to him, but how, I spend more time with my dad than anyone else because I feel like he's the most like, from all my family he is the one who accepts and likes me the most, Thinks Positively of Me, So it's, I've got like a, a complicated relationship with my parents, I mean <mea> and my family in general, Well on the myers uh Briggs personality test I'm uh I'm an extroverter but lately <late> as moved since, but I'm not like, um, I'm not I would probably be on the scheme of the Extroversion uh or on the scale of the Extroversion sorry around I would be extremely introverted around, I just see other extroverts and no matter who they are, they're able to like strike talks and I'm a pretty shy person I'm kind of like, uh, or inhibited person perhaps to, So I like it, Until, Yeah, I'm but I'm working on it I'm working on it, In the past, I'd smoke weed, but I stopped smoking weed., So now I know I have a glass of wine and, Maybe you're watching a movie., um, I didn't or maybe leave as it will depending on whether it's like a xxx when it comes to, if it's a worn-out kind of stress, as if I were just like, then I'm what I do, but if it's a more like fear type stress, I could, go on a uh an intense walk not really practice that much, but I like, You know competitive sports and hiking, pretty good, Well, I always like to fight around, I wouldn't call to fight to lose my temper., um, I enjoy a vicious debate around, But I don't know., as long as I want, Because I don't like to go back to personal you know attacks, in my arguments I try to keep it on topic, um, and try to explain myself as well as I can, which can become frustrating because I'm not like the best articulator of what I think, um, one of my weaker points I would say, But the last time I had a heated debate, I thought that was the question., um, What happened, I forget the question that I had a heated debate, hmm, last time I had a heated debate, I had a heated debate on, Uh the movie boogie nights, um, I was <wa> I didn't lose my temper exactly, but I'm going to be as extremely passionate about, 'Cause I don't think it's so good in a movie, but the two people I was arguing with said that it was like one of the, how the best to get best movies <Laughter> why did they think it was the best movie, um, They think there are some who are there, as I understand it., they have a certain uh they think that the, like all the stories in boogie nights that they have their own, like each of them could have their own separate stories that they just think it's a whole like, Complexity of character in film, and, that somehow like, <sigh> um, what they said, they said like the movie, it's like xxx it's like the end of an era, That makes it like somehow like casino and there's this attention to detail of the in the different character like how they, how they interact in the action, um, Something like, uh, Yeah, I guess,, I think the heated debate was about like that from there and uh like myself it's not like a bad movie or something, but it's, the, I just don't think Dirk Diggler is like meaningful < mean> meaningful of a character like i, I think how I get out I came out of the movie because I had seen it many years ago and anyway my opinion about it is basically the same, although as I remember, when I watched it again, I could reevaluate it, There's nothing bad about the movie, there's nothing articulable like articulateable, it's like solid sound acting, you know the direction is good, the camera moves cool, um, that anyway it's really <rea> you know it's cool it's but, but it's meaningless to me it was like meaningless and then too and then there was that led us to discuss because a movie I saw recently that I really did what was django unchained, and they both saw this movie and hated this movie, and then there was this extreme I think, the heated part of the conversation came like, so in the movie django unchained, around you django and django is like a kind he is a two-dimensional character, but I don't think that necessarily takes away from what the great, the, The big purpose of the film is, and, And you have Doctor King Schultz who's this uh, who is like his mentor character and the person I was arguing with said that he, was intelligent and because he was intelligent, he wouldn't have risked his life to save Django., or how would have gone into this second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to save Django's wife etc., and, and the reason <rea> the reason that they have this argument that like either you buy that he would do that, or he wouldn't, but the reason for their argument is that a smart person would not, Sacrifice for someone else, Him the [stri> who likes me so much, um, how who, How..., she her basic argument was that, Altruism <al> as altruism does not exist <exi> it was a very Ayn Rand type argument Altruism does not exist, The only thing you can do is serve <ser> as if the only thing people do is serve them themselves., so it's not quite Ayn Rand, but it's like the only people thing that people like all people are out to serve themselves, which I don't argue, like, Every decision has been like a mixture of altruism and just like even the altruistic kind of decision there may be like nuclei of self-interests there, but it made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor, in and like what, but how terrible is your life, if that's what your ultimate..., Purpose <pur> as if you were not like love and sacrifice for other people, so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate, um, and uh, something like yeah and it's uh, So yes, I think that's what I don't think I've necessarily lost my temper., I think I'm losing my temper as more, um, as I just did, So <s> I would be so <s>, back to ad hominem like attacks, Um, but I didn't like that..., Maybe I was as if I was criticizing <crit> as if I was criticizing her worldview, but it wasn't like, Well, you're an idiot, You know, it's like it's not like it hasn't turned into abuse., Yeah, I'm glad you understand., an event or an I don't know if I necessarily want to delete something from my memory, I would say a problem I have is not able to remember in as much detail as I want me to remember feelings and moments, not, Stories around, as my life does not synchronize <s> always synchronous to a coherent story it is like this moment and this moment and this moment and this moment so, Yeah, that's good., the hardest decision I've ever had to make, Oh, God, what are you doing?, Could it be just one of the toughest decisions, hmm, um, like the choice between two things that it is like, I guess I have a hard time remembering a moment where I like to choose between, two options like no there is no such as Sophie Wahl Art Moment in my life, But I think the decision because I lived in New York for a while I went to school in New York and uh the decision to leave New York after I lived there for five years was a very difficult one., and uh but I had to do it, for money reasons and because all my core group of friends, were either as abandoned <lea> were most of them going and going other places in the world, and then uh the one other person I was close to was living with someone I couldn't get along with at all, so it was like this situation in which I didn't, I either wanted to live with people I wasn't so close to or Craigslist or move home and I think, it was a tough decision to leave I had in fact it was so hard that the only way I could do it I had to justify it by saying that I would move back, to New York within one or two months, which wasn't what didn't happen, but that was the only way I could, Leaving New York, It was how hard it was., or how hard it is, How hard was that?, um, It was hard., <Laughter>um, it was it was yes it was just a very similar one, Isolating insulation <is>, Because also as if I had fallen <fa> as before at that time I had fallen in love with one of my closest friends, and uh, which had somehow gone extreme, bad, and so I didn't talk to her and I couldn't like the whole thing, all on my list of friends who, like more <mo> closer to xxx she was it wasn't quite like her or me type thing, but that was the way that I somehow, I saw it at the time, so I didn't like it., You know, only socially isolated etcetera, Yeah, that's good., Well, lately it's been awful, um, - I don't know., I like two, so I slept ten and a half hours last night., this seems to be the length of time I have to sleep to have really vivid dreams, But before this night, so last not last night but the night before last and the night before I got four hours and two hours of sleep, Because I worked on the set and came back., and either and I just couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason., too much energy or something I don't know, tired uh, Very, not immediately I think first when waking up as I really enjoy being up early in the morning, and I also stopped drinking caffeine as I had a little coffee in the last two days, but before the last two days I had no coffee in as three and a half weeks so, um, I guess..., with caffeine in my system I'm ready to go, Without caffeine, it is, I'm just quieter, I guess., more introverted, since, as in recent times as in, if, um, Change in my thoughts yeah I mean, I think if I had just moved here, there was a period of time like, anyway at the beginning, where the, the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx because I moved here because I have a group of friends here or a few friends, but I don't like a large number of friends, and the pressure on, To get out there and meet people and find a job and that pressure was pretty..., Overwhelming at first and I think that I'm slowly like, to accept it..., and move you know moves over it i i but not necessarily < nece> you know as if it is still there is still there the pressure is there, but I'm just, you know, you know <sigh> you know <sigh>, No, I'm just..., Yes, the last time I felt really happy, Maybe we have to go back, um, I think the last time I felt really happy, was uh during the writing process of so last year I made a movie, co-written co-directed co-produced co-produced co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-direct, um, and it was kind of like it still consumes my life, but I think during the, Writing stages of the film in which we get up bunkers like, Eating breakfast, Bunkers down work really hard putting stuff on the thing like pure creative, Full energy around between me and the person who writes it and, and there's like probably a xxx a day I remember where only I remember going to bed and I was just so excited to work on what I was working on and and and working with the person I was working with and how, Just like, I felt like it yeah I guess that was the, The last time that was like, anyway more than a year ago though, but I think it's hard to believe that I haven't really been happy since then, but if you have a movie like, you can't allow yourself to be really happy <real> especially if you do, you basically know yourself with <wi> with how xxx can't, It's too much to do., I'd say I'm very, Acceptance of <acce> as, Acceptance from other people, and I'm always very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic around, and, open <o> open <ope> like, enthusiastic about new ideas and open to new ideas and, Yeah, I know., hmm, um, I guess I wish I was less uh, uh, less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my, you know, everyday interactions and in my way, um, you know, Pleasure for life, To <sigh> yeah i xxx, I would change other things about myself., I would, I don't know <Laughter>, hmm, really bad about me, um, I think there are numerous cases in my childhood where my, uh, as every single time there was a problem in school or some kind of, a kind of uh, Conflict with a teacher or something that my parents have always been, always on the other side of the court you know how never, I noticed., or noticed when I got older that other people were other parents, as if her child was in trouble, as if something was wrong with, as if her child was perfect, something is wrong with other people, but my parents were always the opposite, especially my mother, so I would say that there are a few cases in which, To me was as accused or as you know, It was my fault when, as what I did like, Yeah, it's just things that I couldn't like, there's no yes I don't know, Yeah, that's good., Ten years ago,, Stay staked you know how I think it's about, I have a tendency to, how I love <lo> love the fact that I have a tendency to really get caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and how to devote themselves entirely to it, but sometimes, um, Ideas are too easy xxx I would just say as much as possible do as not, Don't decide that you..., will only do, one thing to try, as I think I would have recorded, as some do learn to learn to learn the piano to read music, would be a big thing for me to learn to play the drums, I would say I'd like to learn how to play drums and maybe more like acting lessons., um, I've always directed, so I've always directed actors and stuff, but I haven't.,

gas prices have risen., Traveling as much as it is a fun thing to do, it's expensive, so, uh huh, oh let's see, everything has plus and minus for cold weather <Laughter> not so much sun, so I think I'd rather have more sun and the warm weather so but different from the, It is very pretty back there natural landscape and, But I like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy, but that's a little thing, with, so, mhm, Why did I move to L_a because my family came here and started, uh my dad has a job here and, that became our home base and uh, That's why, easy very easy so, uh huh, Uh good at high school you're generally studying ed yeah it's they've set courses and then after that, went to college and I was a business major, let's see, I was a veterinary major <Laughter>, and uh I graduated with a degree in Liberal Arts so, um, I don't know., can't really determine why <Laughter>, so, I worked in social services, but I also worked in sales and most recently I do real estate, I'm a leasing consultant part-time, I mean, everything has plus and minus it's okay it's not I don't really see too many negatives, oh, likely to work as a uh gossip columnist at, t_m_z or any of these networks < laughter>, but as you know, everything in the entertainment business is very competitive, it's who you know so much, but that would be my dream job or probably work with uh cats you know animals, so, I'm very starting in fact, I think I'm going out so, I scare people sometimes there's a lot of rest, You know the reserved people out there, so I'm some kind of east coast very you know I go to people and talk to them very socially, Oh, my God, there I could do hundreds of things I could read, I could watch a show that turns on the music is great to, Go for a walk, uh, call my friends., Millions of things <Laughter> like this, I'm pretty good I'm very good I mean, you know, of course, if you drive in l_a and someone, Cuts in front of you sometimes this can be irritating, but I'm actually pretty I'm not the kind of person who fight or get I don't like to have confrontations so, mhm, mm, I can't remember., as I said, there are not very many arguments usually i, Avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so, I don't really feel guilty about anything <Laughter> now or that I can imagine, mm, I can't think of anything right now., i, I really can't think of any decisions that were really tough, I mean, most of them are pretty easy for me to make a decision, So I don't have a family, so if I need to know that I had to move to San Francisco once to have a job, but, Since I'm single, I don't really have to consider other people and children and, this kind of thing, so it somehow makes certain things easier if you don't have to look at family, mm, Yeah, that's good., an event, hmm, Well, obviously you don't know that a family member you know you want everyone to be there forever., So I know when my father died, you know, I mean,, I wish I had had him much longer, I mean, he died at the age of seventy-seven and you know, would have been nice to have him a little bit more, but, You know you can't control these things that life has to do with., the, so, mhm, Yes, there are <Laughter> Yin and Yang who are old uh, Philosophy and it really applies there is a plus a minus and negatives and positives, so, as I said, my father is no longer here and my mother and I know you have our differences I think moms and daughters always do, around my brother and I understand myself well I see him a lot I see < s> my sister works a lot, I see her, and you know we're talking, and she has her own life and her kids I know well with., so, Mhm we have a small family, Uh <Laughter> Once again it's like this is a difficult question to answer, there are so many, Guys of kids out there, I think, Most of them seem pretty dazed, I mean, you know, there's always gonna be kids who kind of got out of control., But..., I don't know the ones I saw recently, they're very, well dizzy, so can not say much more about it, Now <Laughter> I live in an apartment <Laughter> and I don't know if you've ever lived in an apartment, but..., There's someone living above me, I'm on the first floor and there's someone on the second floor and they're pretty quiet, but..., They have a habit of <Laughter> I guess they have a lot of energy around them will usually shower around midnight and sometimes they will start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes, run through the bedroom wall <Laughter> so <Laughter> it sounds like Niagara falls in there and uh so I don't, Yes and I need eight hours of sleep and I just got, Oh, I'd say maybe six hours, and then I usually wake up at night, because sometimes they're just..., About two or three o'clock in the morning, they're either walking around or I hear something like that., I don't exactly get eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <Laughter>, But there aren't, like I said, things you can't control when you're living in an apartment, you know, I mean, the lady's very quiet it's just that she's got a habit,, you know, under later showers <Laughter> Wash laundry at night, that is, I can't tell her about it., so, Yeah, but you know there are people who are in worse situations, so I don't make much of it, you know it, and I don't like every night, but you know it., at least twice a week, so I know I may have to sleep in another room, but, For now, you know I'm gonna deal with this, like,, tired <Laughter> very tired and hard to concentrate hard to concentrate it only takes longer to do things because I don't have my energy too I didn't train I usually try to go about half an hour a day, but, the weather was a little colder and a little drier so, You know, I'm not so motivated when the weather's kind of blah, so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours of sleep, mhm, Uh, like I said, uh, tired <Laughter> I'm, It's a combination of the weather you know and here in Los Angeles at the moment we have very gray days I live very close to the sea, So the sun doesn't get out so much, so I don't get my serotonin <Laughter> I need the, i um, I can't get my eight hours of sleep because you know,, Whatever and I think my thyroid's too high, so that's kind of, Create you know I have some vitamin deficiency, and, You know, as soon as the sun comes out, I'm kind of more energetic it just gives you more energy like this., Not mm mm, no, I'm happy most of the time I'm a pretty happy person, and I like to be other people I mean, of course, I like my private time, but I like it to be people pretty much so, hmm, I mean, I usually enjoy everything I do, there's nothing that stands out more than anything else., No, I never regret anything, uh huh, What advice would I have given well, I guess I could probably change things around me thinking it, I probably would have had another college major., You know, it seems like <Laughter>, Uh what else around me probably not with certain men <Laughter>um, Waste of time with certain people, I don't know that these are the things that come to mind, Maybe started saving money earlier you know these kinds of things, but, mm, spend a lot of fun with to uh just be a good friend to have people like me for a friend I'm loyally trusting and uh, I hear I'm a good listener, I'm very patient <laughter> and so, mhm, good <Laughter> number one would be to lose weight, but, I think this is a worldwide problem, I mean, there's a lot of food around and temptations and, especially here in America are many of us couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we, you know it's easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you you need to talk yourself into it so, This is the weight you know will also give you more energy when you lose weight, so that's a big thing than good, but that's probably just the weight thing yeah, mhm, I think you'd have asked me that question before <Laughter>., But if you want, I'll repeat it., I'm very uh, like I said, I'm very loyal when I tell people that I'm going to do something that I'm very reliable., uh, I'm warm, I'm very friendly, I'm a great listener., And I know I've got so many people telling me that they just like with me, like I said I'm very I'm pretty optimistic you know I'm, I'm not gonna let things get me down too much., hmm, This is a difficult question <Laughter>, I can't believe I mean, I'm, I can't imagine answering that <Laughter> so <Laughter>, for fun good I love movies I could see every movie they make around, I love to go out with my friends, shopping swapmeets around my gosh and travel is great road trips, um, That's kind of, you know, Part of it yes that I mentioned so, Traveling always to see different places the history aspect of him, to enjoy the food food in different countries, uh the architecture, it's just kind of neat to get away and see a completely different place, mhm, Okay well <Laughter> I've been around, to many places in Europe I love paris uh it's such a hiking town you can, Whoever designed the city, I'm telling you, I mean, you can get from one point to another the subways are great to, Each area has its own distinctive type of there is the Latin Quarter in which the students are, There is another area where the fashion designers..., Like our rodeo ride here in beverly hills, there is an area that more Africans <af> Africans and they have swapmeets on weekends that are wonderful for international, And then, as I said, when you get out of Paris, there's so much history that you can see the other way around, there are other palaces that you can go to the south of France., But this is probably my favorite country, which I was also in Italy., uh, yes well after college people usually I mean people who go to college or either before or after college, This is a great time to go to Europe because you're young and not tied up you don't have a family and, You have a more adventurous mind that you have more energy, so you know, carrying backpacks or suitcases isn't a big deal around, So yes, that's, mhm, Yeah, that's good., mhm, Thank you., Goodbye.",11

on better terms now., I probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to incite so many things that I should have just let go with the river and just see how it got out, The hardest decision I've ever had to make was, Man I really don't know, um, My father has to go through the surgery and see how he suffers., Well, he had a tumor he had to remove., So it was just hard to see him in bed and just be in the hospital if he really didn't want to be there because he's a real living person and he'd rather run around and stuff, but just seeing him stuck in bed was just awful, Uh me and my family aren't very close we're not, I mean, they were always there for me and I appreciate it, but we never had this close connection < collection> connection <con> connection around, especially since they're strangers so they don't really understand where I'm trying to get out, have grown up, America so it is quite different when it comes to these cultural <cu> racially I mean the cultural boundaries that we somehow take a step across each other's feet on, But apart from that, we have a decent relationship when we talk to each other, it's kind of embarrassing, but it's okay., I think they're out of control., I think they're learning things they shouldn't know at this age, I think they're doing things they shouldn't do, and I don't feel that enough people are telling them they shouldn't, I feel like they're applauded, from the media they are applauded by celebrities to whom they follow, and there's not enough done, and they just get lost, Depends on the night on some nights, it's pretty hard for me to fall asleep like a baby., usually creative actually, If I can't sleep, I just stay up and write something or read a book and ideas will pop up., These things are usually good when I can't sleep, it's nothing bad because I have bad thoughts or something., To lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments when I'm energetic and I'm live, then a few nights a few days where I'm just you know, just sit there, only gently thinking, not like my life itself, I don't know that it's always been the case that these ups and downs always have, but they balance each other., no, no, The last time I felt really happy was, hm, today, From the moment I woke up, it was a beautiful sunny day., i, went to a few friends we had a good time in school, had some good grades on some papers to write a good essay, feel quite successful and, I feel like my day is just, a good day, my best friend would describe me as strange <Laughter>, most people would describe me as strange, I say a lot of strange things that I do strange things that I'm interested in things that most people aren't., um, just like old literature, For revolutionary stuff, Uh things about the change of the world, but, by subterranean means, um, No, I don't live a life of regret, Fear can never stop you from doing something, Um, I'm just reading around with some friends., ride around and find something to do just on an adventure, I don't wish I could change something about myself, I just wish I could build myself into the person I really should be., um, this once I and my best friend got into an argument, And she pointed to all the things I've done, that I shouldn't have done, all at once, how I hurt the people, how I hurt them, the wise men I've done to them who have been brutal, and it just made me feel bad when I reflect on everything, My Parents, I mean, although we don't see eye to eye, they always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day, Although I never listen to her or I don't choose to listen to her, when it happens, I learned from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me, so I learned to trust them more and I learned,, understand that they are wiser than me and they know more than me, I don't travel so much around l_a anymore, try to see new sights, but as far as I don't travel outside, to discover new things to discover things you never knew they were there, or the limitless possibilities, to discover I like to discover new people, New cultures, new things that go against the normal for us and for me, A few days ago, I just drove into the middle of the desert, and I just sat there, and I just enjoyed everything the desert had to offer and it was just pleasant, I felt free from all this, these cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be outside, In the middle of nowhere at a completely random time, It felt good, I'm very proud that I've always been different., that despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird or I'm weird or I think strange things, I have always maintained my original mentality",7

have to work to calm down and sometimes I just, don't, Deal with something and I won't stop., sometimes but I have learned to control it to this extent now, <Laughter> yesterday, I was arguing about what kind of water we should drink., uh good a difference of opinion and I felt as if my opinion was very valid, um, although the opinion of the other party was something, Misinformed, every day is a

I think I've overcome a chapter in my life that was the doctor., um, You know, control of my health and, experimenting with drugs and I just took another route that was alternative and I started, more juicing and to just try to hear, maybe what I needed with the help of uh, Internet and nutrition experts and such things, Yes, Uh I think therapy is useful because, without looking inward or having someone to help you with it, It is very difficult to respond to some of these problems that you may have that, will only uh resonate in the subconscious until you know it has an outbreak it basically, Treatment, will help in general health and mental health, Health I think, for all, Last night..., I have a really great vegan uh, Dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and, had passed a few of my friends and they really liked it very much and I almost converted them <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., I'd say:, You know I'm trying to listen to my inner consciousness more than what my brain wants me to do., how my brain likes caffeine and sugar, While you know that my body needs something other than this xxx, is an example, It's very difficult, it's a daily process, Um, I was..., Dealing with money for uh a business partner and, They ended briefly and I was to blame, but it was actually my formulas of, crunching the numbers that made it short, but they he was not aware of the change that I made to the formula so, the fault was on me that I might have taken money and I automatically felt bad about it because of my, restless uh my uncertainty about changing the formula, um, no, Twenty years ago I was two years old ten years ago I was twelve years old I would tell myself to, to start eating, Raw fruits and vegetables every day, as calm and, um, Sadly perhaps cleverly talented, um, I really enjoyed going to uh wholesale food market in downtown Engels, around <sigh> a lot of food, uh great prices you can, eat and feed an entire family for a third of the

years and a small town called catalonne and was very much around, it was actually really fun, but very much like a story book so far what I expected to see and what I actually saw, like me, what I remember that I was really enjoying that at night when everyone close, as there are no windows in the buildings, but, they are these shutters that most places in the United States have inside windows they have them outside the windows and there is no glass so they just closed and it looks like everything is leaving as if the buildings are leaving pretty cool < sniff> I like that, I'm at the

temperament, I'm not, Hot head at all, hm, Oh, it was an ex-roommate, And it was about my loyalty as a friend, Yeah, pretty much she..., thought that because I wanted my rent, which it has agreed to pay, the, I had not taken, to be a good friend, that I should just let her live for nothing and, that would not happen, So you know it, Loyalty came with you anyway to let stay or let her stay anyway, even if she didn't pay me, So this is a friend., I could have thrown her out., she went at the agreed time after she told me she wouldn't pay, but, you know, If I had..., There could have been a bad situation, but there was an argument., a real real, I wish I had treated this situation differently and followed my first mind as, We agreed to be temporary roommates, and, to get my money in advance, That's what I wish I had done and I just didn't have my mind told me to join in, No, my mind told me to get the money in advance., But I didn't do it., so, mm, the toughest decision, um, I think I still have the toughest decision to make, but as far as, <tisk<> maybe to leave home, When I was 18 years ago,, Yeah, that's good., um, I felt like I was leaving my family, <Laughter> that's what I felt <Laughter> but they encouraged me to go further and live my life, mhm, Uh, something I could erase from my memory, likely, a friend, Who, I was..., I'm going out with you., I'd like to erase from

make a decision faster, and to act on it, really bad, Uh, I don't know if I have a time someone has ever made me really bad, I don't know., Feel bad about, much, uh, as brave, that would be it at a

and I decided to leave there, and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work, but, it was hard to decide how I should leave l_a and do this, jump and follow something new and experience something new or stay in what I did, I was I had a degree in dental assistance I did that for like a year I didn't like it and then I studied communication, such as radio and television broadcasting and journalism, I do event work and wrote for a magazine for a few years and I try to like it., get a site going and then have how where I write my own and what's going on instead, you

nice weekend and uh on a boat, uh or on a skiff a really small boat and around, try to fish in, I felt free or alive to be happy, around uninhibited, Uh strong confident uh mature, after the military, Uh after the military, took some time to get my, my thoughts and uh, my future and around, I have only taken the necessary steps to make progress., It's kind of hard, it's, um, It wasn't easy., a lot of family uh help and around and community, and uh, so it needed some adjustment, but it wasn't easy, uh no, no, You know., This week, Partially today, Happy., uh happy kind often not too happy, but,

405,"Hello., Yes, All right., not, Too bad., I'm from Chicago., South side, around back in nineteen seventy-eight, When I was eighteen, yes <y>, lately, not much maybe every two or three years, It's different, you know., terrible weather and uh, Yeah, it's just a completely different atmosphere., um, Let's see, my mother had moved to Africa., I graduated from high school, and I had a friend out here, so I just thought good let me try l_a, uh very simple actually yes I loved it from the moment I got off the plane, Yeah, that's good., Number one the weather, Sun is very important to me, so I love the weather, I don't know what a more relaxed atmosphere is., Variety, from humans, And now it's my..., my home base you know, my, Friends, the family are, So it's kind of like my family's here now., hmm, I guess the smog earthquakes, um, Transport, simple basic things like this really, Um, I don't know right now, but I've been traveling all my life, quite a lot, I just wanted to see., See, other crops; and, See for more history and, Meeting with people and, just fun and the fun of it also, To see a journey, I went to, england, ireland and scotland and france all in, you know, a journey, so that was a nice variety, um, I guess you could say, probably skiing, in val d'isere france, That was fun., I'm glad I have to do this., I'm shy by nature, I tried to grow out of shy so, I'm not quite shy, but I've always been an extremely shy, Child, But now here in the bold city this is my, Environment and I guess you could say I'm not really shy in, in my hometown of the culver city, hm, to relax I like to just lure myself into my bed and take a nap reading my book, Clock t_v, sometimes on the couch in the living room, only you know to stay at home and, a little vegetative, ah pretty good yeah my temperament is pretty level, hm, Probably with my, Husband, and, I can't remember what it was about right now., Well, if you say my family, you mean, my family from childhood or my current family, Okay well I think my current family comes to mind, I have two daughters, and, My relationship is pretty good, it's okay with them, but they're teenagers who uh, you know, go through a lot of hormones and, um, they can be kind of bitchy <Laughter> and, And I was hoping that you know they're growing up and soon, one day, we're gonna have a really good relationship., And then there's the husband, the, I think I could say soon to be ex-husband hopefully soon <Laughter>, We have to get a divorce, but we're still together., for financial reasons, and yes, Yeah, so that's not good., the relationship with the man, but..., but since we have decided that we must get divorced, we expect nothing from each other, so we don't argue so much, so that's good, hm, All right., I guess..., Our Marriage, I wish I'd noticed early on that, You know, it was like getting away from what I thought it was., Let's see, O my God, The most difficult decision, I guess leaving my first husband who was pretty hard, Well, you know, we were married and I wasn't, Content I think you could say, Ahem and, I'm just..., gave up our relationship and, I think that now that I look back, it's because, I wanted to, Children and he would have been happy to have none, And so uh since I didn't have a father, it was very important, that i, Making children with someone who really wanted to be a father, And so I was kind of, at an age when I had to start thinking about it, with children, nor was I with someone who really wasn't in it, so that, I think that's a uh maybe the main reason why I wasn't satisfied and I just, felt like, This marriage won't work., So you know that we went to therapy and everything and he didn't want to break up and, # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #, <tisk> and I had to leave him, because I was just not happy and that was very hard because, you know, I felt like I was hurting him what I was, you know, and he survived that he survived, now he's married to two children <Laughter>, <Laughter> but around, It was, Hard, to leave him, mm, something I wish I could erase from my memory, I have to think about it., I'm sure there's a little bit of asp> Oh good, Yeah, there's..., I guess it would be nice to delete, from my memory to a new I don't mean new, but an event, in my, Recently adult age here in the culver city, where one of my best friends, um, I betrayed myself., Years ago, when my husband was first in real estate, she and her family grew and they really needed a bigger home, and, um, We just assumed that you knew they'd use it., my husband as their agent both to sell their current home electricity at the time, and buy a new home, <tisk> and how it turned out, they have surprised us and, had spoken to this other local agent, And yes., That was devastating., I don't think I've ever been betrayed., It's like the, So I wish I could erase this now, because now you know that was back when the kids were really young., and, my daughter at the time when my youngest daughter was, let's say, Six maybe, um, Maybe five, Whatever you're doing,, She and my best friend, Daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other, we were pregnant together, and, they were really tight these two little girls and they didn't end up in the same primary school so they didn't hang out during these years, but every time we run them in the neighborhood or they, to meet in a summer camp or something that they were just so connected, You know like two peas in a pod, though it is., Her mothers stopped talking to each other., So now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together, and they are still very connected in fact <Laughter>, for the first time she spent the night in our house last night with my daughter, And another girl, And it's just a little embarrassing because you know it now., These girls are, Always really good friends better friends, um, and yet, I still have that., Vibrant, um, bad memory, of what they, her mom closed up, for me, That was about what, Ten, About eight years ago, In any case,, I tried, I tried,, Ignore it and push it out of my head and, which I was able to do <sniff>, over the last few years, but obviously it's still coming, Anyway, that was that, It's not that simple., I get a decent sleep sometimes, but, sometimes it's hard to sleep and most of the time I wake up, and can't sleep again, or I'll finally sleep again and then it's almost time to get up, you know that, this difficult thing, Well, waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by going to the toilet <Laughter>, and then, You know, it's not always that easy to sleep again and then I wake up to go to the toilet., So I guess that's the trigger, until sleep a hard time there, I don't know I think too much., run through my mind and the day, I feel like I haven't reached enough during the day so, It's hard for me to just go to sleep if I'm supposed to, I guess..., um, Well, I'm kind of used to it now, So I just keep going., probably looking through the day <Laughter> looking tired and around, I'm used to being tired, I just do what I have to do., and sometimes when I'm able to when I'm home and don't have, huge commitments yeah I could just take a nap or something like I said before, Read my book watch t_v watch whatever, lately, how did I feel about, Type from bottom, on myself down to life, Well, I still have this outstanding, Necessity <n> Necessity for Separation Slashed Divorce, um, I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls, now they're teenagers., You know on the edge of adulthood, And so I'm worried that, you know, I've done all kinds of things wrong., with her leadership and her early childhood and < clears throat> now it's too late, um, as if I'd missed a thing < th> a lot of things, uh, And yes, I need a job, I'm unemployed, I don't know what I want to do with my life., I know I want to do something, I just wish..., You know, I never finished college, unfortunately, because I was on my way and so, So I'm sorry that extreme, and I have to get a job and take care of myself because I, Divorce and move on with my life, so, now I forget what the original question was, but <Laughter>, um, This is the state., Part of the state of my life, no, Yes, mm < tisk>, All right., for the first time or or or recently, The first time I think was, You know, when I was in my early twenties, I was just a little bit, Angry about <Laughter> by chance, that was another breakup I had to do back then, I was..., <tisk> in my early twenties and I had to break up with my boyfriend, but again it was very disturbing because I, It was hard because he didn't want to break up and I felt like I was hurting him., and I didn't understand that feeling, I was really excited., as I did not, my first time was with depression, so I didn't really do it, recognize it as depression, but I went somehow i, ==References==, Knowledge or knowledge, I was able to, Take me to a psychiatrist, I remember paying her by the hour., and she prescribed Xanax to just help me relax, and so I guess that helped me through this and then I have depression over the years just you know small parts here and there for various reasons like, I guess it's usually a relationship <Laughter>, um, Yeah, so the last time I was diagnosed, and take medication, that was probably around, Two years ago, no, I don't have insurance., otherwise yes, I would like, for therapy <Laughter>, anything that could help, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,, Boy, the last time I felt really happy, um, I don't know, I guess maybe, when my children were born, This is, um, I guess happy I don't know <Laughter> I just know you know, I always wanted kids, so it was nice, to have them, This is, I don't know, that's all I can remember that I don't think I don't remember the good times too well <Laughter> I remember the bad times, mm, something I did that I really enjoyed, All right., Let's see if I..., Friday night I went to a friend's house, and met with, five other girlfriends and we, We created Vision Boards, and spoke and, had dinner, at one of their houses, that was the fun, Yeah, that's good., we arrive, ooh <sigh>, stay in college get my degree, um, get therapy try to become a happy, um, Yeah trying to figure things out earlier in life, For example:, Yeah, that's good., Stay in college and oh and especially I think that the main you know what it all cooks < laughter> no matter what you feel depressed about it like, as the proverb says and the songs <s> the, Songs you know, it's all about money the world is about money and, with none, that in itself is very depressing <Laughter> so next to relationships and various things that have happened in your life, Without money, is, You know, it's like you can't even try to fix something because you don't have the money to fix it., so, in this sense, I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree, and to stay <s> to get a job and stick to it, um, Don't stop., to go travel you know,, easy with a job stick with a company build your, Age of service you retain your benefits, and build up some knowledge or knowledge in some kind of field, Yes, it would have been., my greatest advice for me, not much <Laughter>, I guess..., only my daughters you know, beautiful daughters and, I am proud and glad that I was able to have children some people, are not even able to do that you know, and they try so hard, or they look back at their lives and they wish they had done so, this is the one thing I mean, I wanted, five kids and I always wanted a boy I never had, but, I'm, I guess that's the, the biggest thing I can do, Remember to be proud, has my two daughters, um, I am a very loyal, Friend and Person, That's why, When this friend betrayed me, it was so devastating, Yes, very loyal., Very, <inhale> happy <hap> I mean, what I'd say I'd say happy happy <l> going lucky I don't know where that came from, I'm very much I wanted to say friendly, and, Maintenance and, Yes, I care about people., and I'm interested in people, and, I'll take care of it., also animals, I'm proud to be a vegetarian., Yeah so my daughters and be vegetarian, I'm a vegetarian because it's important to me., feelings of other beings not only humans, but also animals and, I don't think animals should be tortured., And a hard life,, Just so we can eat them., So, um..., What was the question?, remember the question, All right., You're welcome., See you.",17
406,"Yes, I'm doing good., I'm originally from Southern California, I like the downtown theater district I like the beaches I like the variety of things you can do in a day, hmm, good sometimes I don't like traffic, I don't think there's really too much I don't like., No, I didn't really travel in about five years., Oh, I was just not able to travel around, I just didn't travel <Laughter>, I like to go to new places and see things I've never seen before and if I like to visit., Places like landmarks, Well, the last thing I did was San Francisco, that wasn't ready, but I had to stay in downtown San Francisco and I had to go shopping., and I had to get on one to get the road car so that was cool, xxx, Well, I'm still studying, I'm studying psychology, mhm, hmm, Good <sigh>, I decided to go back to school, just pretty fast, so I went to junior college, And then, when it came close to graduation, I knew that I wanted to transfer so, I had taken some psychology classes and I decided I liked it, so I decided to do my major, and it, I thought it didn't have much math but it had, enough math <Laughter> so, < deep breath> mm <sigh> good now that I'm almost done, I don't know if I'm going to continue in this area., Well, what I originally wanted was to get <sigh> into sports psychology, but I'm not, I'm sure that's what I want, either, All right., I could be shy at first, but as soon as you meet me, I'm going out., <sigh> I think I'm either going to sleep eating something really good or watching something on netflix, good only a good movie I like foreign movies a lot about so much, Right now I'm in about Martial Arts movie with subtitles so, I think I'm pretty good, hmm, You know I know., They're not really long arguments I don't know if they're real arguments I know I argued with my friend around <Laughter> because he hung up in my face but I don't know why and it was solved pretty quickly so I don't know if it was really so important, Wait, I went out without saying, oh okay, hmm, I can't think of one right now., I think, the hardest decision I probably had to make, he moved, from good back to California from Oregon, Well, I was really young, so I was..., nineteen twenty-ish and I was really alone, so that was pretty hard, because obviously I had to support myself, because it was really boring in Oregon, so I like the activity here in l_a, You know I don't really feel guilty about many things., Well, I'm not talking to them so much about my dad my stepmother living in Oregon so I'm probably talking to them on the phone at least once or twice a month, and then, when they come here, I want to say, at least once a year sometimes it can be known twice more occasionally, but not too often then I see them, um, that's it, but I'm pretty much the only one out here my brother's also up there, Yeah, that's good., hmm, Well, I had a lot of positive influences I think about, Just normal people I know, maybe someone I've worked with, maybe, My uncle is really a good positive influence, he knows he has a lot of good advice., mm about <bout> life, hmm, You know, I don't really think something so bad happened to me where I just didn't uh, where it bothers me so much that I don't have to think about it, Pretty <pret>, Well, I can't say quite simply because I work strange schedule and then I go to school, but..., Yeah, if I want to sleep, I sleep really well, but as long as I have enough, you know, hours., really really happy and good, Yes, no, I'm always happy uh <Laughter> God yesterday, I'm always happy when I talk to my friend, or when I go out and do something, I'm just happy, I'm from work, I'm happy because I'm done for the day, I'm just really happy, I'm in the spring break, I'm really happy now., oh I haven't done like any really extreme fun activities unless you're considering going to eat, but the last activity, that I had a lot of fun doing ice skating around downtown in downtown l_a in December, No, I don't really have too much regret, I mean, whatever happens and you know it was meant to play like that., hmm, Well, um..., I guess I'd say don't worry about those little things., Although they really seem big, they're really insignificant and uh, You won't think about it in six months., I think my, best qualities are I'm a happy person I'm a funny person I'm pretty easy to get with I think most people like me, And I'm just a cool person, Well, I wish I could study more I wish I would study more, I wish I'd train more., and I wish that was, Yeah, I think that's it., hmm, I don't think I want to talk about it., hmm, I don't know, I guess I just care about supporting myself don't go back home I think that's about the best performance there is, Thank you., See you.",2
407,"Yes, I feel really good because I..., I've been sleeping, all day yesterday almost and I usually do something when it's not work, it's school when it's not school, It's work and then social life and all that, so I actually didn't have work yesterday and I don't have a school, I only have school on the weekdays, so I actually slept probably like, Eighty five percent of the day, so I really feel good, but I'm actually kind of tired and I've got other things going on, but different from that I'm good today, I'm originally from Bakersfield., california, really, I moved to l_a when I was a child and then, I left here when I was about three or four., and I was moved, I moved back here, in oh seven and I have lived here, Since, um, wow since I've been here since oh seven I'm just back maybe <clears thoat>, Maybe how, a few times <ti> well I went there for like a summer, As in oh, Eight, I think I've been there almost all summer, but I've only been back a few times since I got back., Unfortunately,, Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um,

sacramento actually I didn't get to tell you I was born in Bakersfield then I lived here and then i, Anyway, I don't know if I forgot anyway, yes, there's nothing really to do, it's really small, it's the valley around, I have everything to do., Oceans and it is located by all kinds of around, through many cool places like vegas and uh, san diego and what have you not so <s>, but yes, otherwise I miss my friends and stuff, but I don't miss, like the actual city, I just miss some of the people who, I grew up with, Oh, I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel much, actually I was just out, california like six times, I'd love to travel, once I uh, have enough money to do this, um, I originally wanted to be a filmmaker, and that I still want to be a filmmaker and I want to, Studying <stu> I was, I took the communication and uh, have also general ed things and around, took classes like video production and around <tisk>, has done a lot uh in terms of to films, and I've learned a lot of things and I still have that knowledge, but I haven't really used it since I've been back, here in l_a I did all this in Northern California in Sacramento, but around and then I switched <trans> to be, Um to the business I took some courses in that, but now I'm actually studying to be an optician and I'm actually almost done, with schooling and always ready to try to get into the field and, become an optician so, But I still want to be a filmmaker, and that's still one of my plans., and I still have to actually play in to poker, a few years ago and I really like, the idea of becoming, a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player, but both of these jobs are, extremely hard to earn out and you, must be like the small percent so that we can see if then, hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere, to be an optician, Oh, uh,, I guess I was just trying to find something that it was like it was like a trade, it's good, it's a private college, but, it just as specific, Trains you in..., a field and you just learn that you don't like your g_e and, all these other classes as you would normally do for how to, like one around a major or whatever you're going to do, so it trains you specifically to be an optician and jump into the field, I took it just because I really want to be a dentist assistant and since <si>, It sounds like something I might be able to do., It sounds interesting, but then the consultant actually, to get my attention on an optician, so, I'm trying to be an optician now, and it's so interesting, It's fun, it's..., really hard, but it's interesting and it, and it's, and it's fun it's got to be rewarding, um, Benefits to the extent that it is worthwhile to be able to help people to see, better and feel comfortable with, Glasses or contact lenses, whatever they feel, more comfortable with, Cool, I'm definitely leaving, but I can be shy, sometimes like I'm a little shy right now because, They're talking to you and you're in a computer and you're a cartoon, or uh animated or whatever <Laughter>, so, Cool, but none normally ninety eight percent, To me actually, what it's actually kind of funny and I think maybe, This could go for some of the poker players to, I've never really spoken to a professional poker player, but as far as I want, Uh, actually..., Playing Poker Is About, actually something that, helps me forget everything, as far as e.g., Things in the past or present, Um or future things that come uh as far as I'm really relaxed <rela>, I just couldn't think about anything and just think about poker and it's actually kind of like a therapy, for me, because I don't like it, I guess you could say it's some kind of drug because I don't think about anything as far as stressed or depressed or things that have happened in the past, I focus on poker, so it's actually kind of exhilarating, Playing poker is also very stressful, so I guess it's kind of like, Catch twenty-two or whatever, but uh, Yeah so no poker I play like basketball, I like watching movies I like going to the beach actually, One of the things I like to do is go to the beach because it does, I feel good., But I didn't leave., I usually just go to the beach when it's hot not during the, Cold season, So it's coming soon, so I'm looking forward to being busy, but uh, I'll try to go to the beach as much as I can <Laughter>, I'm really good at controlling my temperament, actually I've just been in like, I'm thirty years old, I've been in six fights, maybe and, All six were launched by the other person., So I've never started a real fight in my whole life when I was a little kid, but, to talk about real things, like when you put it on a, thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no I'm good like every once in a while when there was, a few times maybe in the past, where like i, was not able to control it, but as far as ever to be violent or anything that never happened and never would, But for..., most of the time yeah I didn't like, People do stupid things all the time and I just like to leave it especially like, on the highway and stuff, but uh, oh well I mean I argued a little bit with my ex-girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really, Little things, I guess maybe we're just, I think we were good for each other, but maybe another life because uh, We just knocked our heads too much., Obviously, she's probably my ex-girlfriend for a reason like this., about which we have only quarreled, Girlfriend friend things, uh, um, I guess my film production <filmm> to, Other treatment, There are a lot of things I could have handled differently, but uh, Uh maybe when I was really good when I was younger and, I worked for, Scrubbed_entry, Production assistant for filmmakers around, Where I lived in Sacramento, so I did everything I wanted to do about my dreams, and had a lot of my stuff together I had my own car my own apartment, And then I got involved with the wrong guy., Group of people I appreciate and, somehow downhill from there and how lost everything like car job apartment, So I just wish maybe I'd never go with, this kind of people, this kind of girls, Um, um..., per and per, Uh, because I'd clean my throat, probably my life would probably be a lot different now but I think everything happens for a reason, and obviously I think you should also like when things happen good or bad uh, <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again, you..., do not make this mistake or try it not so bad I think so, you know, mm, Hardest decision, I guess, I guess, uh, toughest decision, the hardest decision I've ever had to make, would be..., I guess you could say I don't really know., wanted to say that uh, Maybe like my ex-girlfriend, like I could've liked, stayed with her and I really like still in love with her and uh, would love to be with her and miss her, but I guess the biggest mistake I had to make was how, I know it wasn't like a healthy relationship and, I know if we liked to stay together or if we married or had children who, I don't think it would work in the end anyway, I guess the decision that would be my hardest decision, To really stay away from her and not come back with her, and uh, Don't be like that with her, I guess that was a tough really hard decision because..., I could have done it easy, and I guess maybe it would have been me., in this way happier, but stressed and, in order to be irritable or whatever and have to deal with the other way with it I guess with each other our relationship so, It was really hard is still so uh I think that's it, do not choose to be with someone I loved and loved, or whatever it is, Cool, Oh, what was that?, I beg your pardon., nevad, I do not understand the first part of this question., Oh an event, Oh an event okay around that I could delete, Uh event I could get out of my memory, My ex-girlfriend, I wish I'd never met her., My first girlfriend and my last girlfriend, I wish I'd never met her because we were, we were in love together for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard, so, I guess both of them, Oh, it's extremely easy that I could fall asleep, somewhere I actually broke a record I almost fell asleep standing, that would have been strange because I think I would have, I don't know that I just got caught., I think I was really <r> I mean I was really tired, but I do a lot of things so it's hard for me not really get so much sleep, as much as I want to like <l>, but I could sleep when I'm dead or whatever., as they say, <tisk> uh no, no, lately I'm just tired, but I'm fine I guess, I'm dealing with this separation, but it's only a month a week., But it's actually not I mean I've happened worse things I'm going to happen worse things, had worse things happen so yeah, I guess..., Well, I'm a religious person, I'm Catholic I believe in God I know that there is a God so around I obviously even dedicated everything from him, People to God, no matter what they are, sometimes they lose faith, so sometimes I lose faith, but it doesn't take that long and I know there's a God I know., that I'm gonna be okay and that everything's gonna be okay, but you know, it's hard to deal with, I don't really know, I just keep going you know, go to school and work, and I just have to keep going, I can't give up, so I can just, try to stay busy and, Staying busy helps somehow and how to sleep, a lot helps, but I can't sleep much so, I don't know., Uh play poker, Play basketball, Deals helps me deal with it and how uh, Hanging out with my friends sometimes helps me, why, Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., I felt really happy on Friday because..., I went to San Diego for the first time., It wasn't as cool as I thought, but we were like under certain circumstances, as far as my boyfriend had business to worry about and it took a long time so, I would have preferred to be free during this time but I wasn't, but we had fun and it was cool uh I enjoyed it so yeah I really liked uh I had fun and I was, happy to go to San Diego for the first time and I want to, had a good time, oh, She's, To <Laughter>, a lot of things, but I think I'd say how, Be nicer to like, Family members You know a couple of family members I wish I had been, other than:, acted differently than not that I was like a terrible, but I would have nicer in some cases that if I didn't know the situation at hand uh, I never really wanted to go around and celebrate all the time as I did, like high school and various part-times from outside high school I would have only, really focused on re-training and so and then, The party would not have gotten any relationships later, so I would have basically told myself to be more., Uh have more direction to be focused, I guess uh, Stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people I don't appreciate that I'm the healthiest but < sniffle> around yeah I just would have done a lot of things differently, but, I don't know if I said that before, but I think it's all happening for a reason., um, So I guess it all happened., now for a reason, So I'm just gonna keep going., uh, <tisk> I guess they would have the few I have, or few I had because I have best friends now a few I think a new, and I've lost a few best friends as far as we just don't like going our own ways, but I guess they'd probably all describe me more than how, to happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy, Umm aloud uh, Don't be silly., Uh intelligent, and uh, I just think in uh in general just like, entertaining to be around, have, I wasn't always the best best best friend, but I'm trying to tell you my toughest, So that's how it's like, Cool, To <sigh>, change me uh, I wish I'd been around, <xxx> I wish I was 15 pounds lighter, um, I wish I didn't have to., uh, How can I say put this uh I feel like, um, I feel like I'm I feel like I'm, I must be like in a relationship with a girl, I feel like I wish I didn't have to be, as if I felt like, that I had to have a girl all the time, and so I could help me focus on how more, and I wish I didn't need it, Sexually around, I didn't always think about sex thing to girls all the time as far as, I have to be in a sex, with them like, As far as sex wants to do as much as I do because I feel like, if I have not concentrated or have to, how to be with girls or like in a relationship, Well, who I don't know how to say it, but I'm just saying how I exist like guy friends I know, I don't need as much sex as I do and I feel like I need more than I sometimes feel like I wish I didn't need it that much, so I think I'm a little addicted to it., where I could focus on more things than just, I mean, I don't just focus on sex, but I feel like I'm focusing on it if I don't need it or think I need it so much that I could do more things in my life., but, Yeah, so I'm trying to work on it., <low breath> <sigh> what I am most proud of, uh, I'm very proud of, <makes sounds with the mouth>, I'm very proud <prou> oh I guess I'm very proud to work for TV stations back in Sacramento and on a lot of around, Movie sets, because like me, I was sixteen and I decided I wanted to be a fimmaker and then, two years later, a year and a half later, I started taking steps to become a filmmaker and then I worked., Work in the economy and as a filmmaker for a real, Really..., Really..., good to cinematograph a really good to freelance cinematograph, which is based on living in sacramento they have a lot of things, so I'm proud to have had a dream and I went for them and I and actually end up doing things to my dream, which in my dream so, Yeah, I guess that's one of my greatest accomplishments, like, over ten years ago but I hope I know, Something like that could happen again soon or you know it like this, Perfect, Goodbye.",3

409,"All right., mm, All right., safe, mm, I'm fine., I'm from uh l_a, Yeah, that's good., I like the weather I like the sports teams I like the entertainment, Yeah, that's good., Uh, it's pretty much the same year around as well as actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get all four seasons, so it's kind of like a mixed bag, and, I guess I'm kind of used to it by now, so it would be kind of nice to explore other areas., I've lived here all my life because I've made too much travel, so uh, It's a bit of a ruttiness., But overall, it's okay., Well, I've taken computer programming into operations, but that goes back to the seventies, so the technology has changed a lot, as one can say <Laughter> in the last forty odd years <Laughter>, That's why it was my major, yeah., um, I don't know that it's kind of curious that you have to use your mind., it was as if you knew brand new something that you know very new, back in the, in the old times that one knows in the seventies, now it's all for computers, but then it was kind of like < sniff> something very unique around, You didn't see you know too many computers back then., and around I worked in programming so that I somehow put into the logic of it you know compilation together, You know to solve a, a special to know problem you come up with step by step solutions on I think all kind of back then I was somehow more into the, the analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> I can't say this word now <laughter> the analytical properties of the, the problem, mhm, uh, No, I kind of turned off, I'm still using computers, but I haven't got yet, I wasn't in programming for a long time, Well, I kind of got into another area, kind of a distraction., Uh turnoff <divorcion> to turn off to another area in my life, uh that goes back to the..., The late seventies I somehow took a different turn and then, when I somehow came back into it, it was, I kind of got into another field, so I never really followed it., up to the degree I wanted, Wow that's a good question <Laughter> I've never thought about it uh, well actually kind of ironic <i> ironic actually something was pretty simple at this time, So maybe that's why I'm a little depressed and then..., At this point I wanted to somehow just do some kind of a beautiful relaxing, Job but I want something of a challenge, but I don't want to do too much, too much thinking, that's almost like the opposite of what I was back in the old days you know, I just want a nice comfortable relaxing work that I can feel, Fulfillment, but I don't want to, too tense of a situation that I am somehow in the place in my life where I just want a nice, relaxing work, Yes <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., Oh, I'd say, good for most shy, but sometimes when I go I could be going out, Um, but..., I speak in general, I'm shy to start with and then sometimes I can loosen somehow and be more, Singing and sometimes I can take it to the extreme where I talk too much, as once the funny gates open them kind, Open up too much, so I have to turn my back on you., but overall I would say I'm kind of shy as a general behavior, Oh, really, really, really., Yes <Laughter>, Oh, uh,, Well, I listen to music around, I'll take a good look around., I'm gonna..., What do I do to relax?, well I just try to avoid stressful situations like somehow I stay relaxed I also talk to my friends, I'll be in an area, All around, Type of comfort area where i, I feel safe I can only, Dialogue with people so somehow brings me out of my, Think of my own, Problems I have somehow I just know you focus, about being at the moment with my, Well-known <acqu> Friends and acquaintances, I'm pretty good, I don't really have a temperament problem., It takes a lot to get me to explode uh, I think when I was younger, I was a little bit more, had a little light temperament I never had a really bad temperament but uh, Uh Temper isn't really a problem I have, I tend to be quite gentle easy to walk, Yeah, that's good., Wow, that's a good question., um, I'm not sure to be honest., I would have to think about it, to be honest for a long time <Laughter>, I can't come up with an answer to that., it's not really part of my repertoire, Nothing comes to my mind from above on my head, All right., um, Well, the only thing I can imagine and somehow go back I made some bad investments <in> bad investments, back about ten years ago, I was more around, I'm trying to think about what word I'm looking for for more people's trust, how uh people and how uh <tisk> I thought were experts in their field, and, I inherited some money, I was a little careless about it., and I just had a mood that you know... nothing would go wrong, kind of a little bit of naivety <nait> nativity, and unfortunately I've done something bad, Financial decisions that somehow make me into a bad, Position for the rest of my life, unfortunately, because of a medical condition I have, it's hard for me to recover and you know, make it all out, So I'd say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions, that I really regret, Wow, hmm, That's a tough one., I can't think of anything from my head <Laughter>, All right., oh, Well, uh, I don't really have too much family left, the only one I have is my..., It's just me and my uncle., and we communicate <c> we communicate regularly around, he lives <li> but he lives in clear water florida, So we're all right., But..., He's like eight, he's in the eighties, and obviously I'm in the fifties, so..., we're doing we kind of have a little conversation he's kind of worried about my well-being, but it's kind of flat on a flat level it's not us getting really deep, And he has his own problems., so that we don't really get into too deep a conversation, and different from him it's really there's not really someone else I have, So it probably depressed me a little because I don't really feel, I have someone I can really count on or trust., I don't know why, but I have a medical condition, so I think that might be part of the problem., and, I've been, a little b_p_a, so I have to get up to go to the toilet., and, to answer your question <Laughter> to a, long story short <Laughter>, um, it's difficult to sleep a good night I usually wake up uh feeling a little tired, or pain, so it's difficult, Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., Well, I feel okay, I mean..., I felt kind of tempered..., I'm trying to solve problems I don't have., Responsibilities assumed for, But..., I feel a little calm as of late, no, Well, I said yes when I filled out the questionnaire and, I'm not positive if I was technically diagnosed with taking a uh, I think it's m_m_p_h, the multifaceted Minnesota, Personality something of whether or not, that goes back about six months ago, they asked me questions about my memory, but then they also got questions about my, my well-being also psychologically and I think some of the, The answers said that they, guess that I see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, I didn't follow that., And that's because..., of philosophical differences, But I think I have one you know., a mild case of depression, Well, you know..., as I said, I'm just kind of like a way to go in life I'm uh, I'm fine, but I know that I, Life is passing, so I haven't really fulfilled my life., My goals, you know, I'm kind of alone, I'd like to have a girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend, so that's someone I feel like I can get closer., and I'm not really I'm kind of in a transition time in my life now so uh, There's a little uncertainty, I've got some you know, some kind of financial uncertainty, So, um..., You know I'm not as good as I'd like to., Wow, That's a good <laughter>, really happy to, Let me think about it a minute, Well, it wasn't so long ago that I was actually dealing with <makes sound with mouth>, Okay, I know you can really come up with an answer, I helped a lady she was at a fair., it was home it was a natural product expo so it was pretty nice we uh, we had some nice meals afterwards there were a lot of exhibitors, Give away really nice samples, It was in Anaheim, so somehow I got a chance to get away from l_a, and, You know some interesting people met who were very extraordinary, they were willing to like, let me experience your products or services, and, I was near people who, I work with whom I have to socialize with so much, I think I was pretty happy back then and that was about uh, About a month ago, Yeah, that's good., Yeah, that's it., Best friend, I don't know if I really have a best friend, but uh, I'd say..., hmm, I don't technically know that I really don't have a best friend, so it's really hard for me to answer that, so uh, I can't really come with an answer to be honest <Laughter>, um, I like to be conscientious, You know, I have mistakes and everyone, but I think, overall,, I'm conscientious I'm trying to be honest for the most part on the most important questions I may know, say little white lies or you know,, I'm not perfect on it, but when it comes to the serious stuff, I tend to be pretty honest and I'm a tough worker I got <g> good work ethics, um, I tend to, pretty quiet for the most part, um, what do I regret?, well you may have that <Laughter>, Um, um..., I'm just good, just total, I regret uh, a little more persuasive in in my previous, uh previous life uh, and somehow put me in this position, It's kind of due to my financial decisions that were kind of like my Albatross in my life., I made some bad decisions and unfortunately, I have to pay the price for now somehow, so I like, Something like, Living a kind of pauper existence at the moment that is somehow a kind of depressing, So I'd say that's probably what I regret the most, Well, I'd say to really know you're somehow going to analyze with what you really feel around, I think, I gave advice to other people with the opinion of other people, I was kind of gone from, my basic, Being that you know how I really felt, like for example I would do aggressive, Uh invest that, if it turned out it would have been like a way of winning the lottery I would have been, good for the rest of my life <Laughter>, but unfortunately it went in the opposite way, too many eggs in this basket, So I kind of regretted going with you, my gut feeling and let other people influence me, and uh, Because by nature I'm a conservative person, so I really should make more concervative investments, in other areas of my life I tend to be more conservative, but somehow I did some, aggressive financial decisions, so that's pretty much, Somehow it always goes back to this area as far as I regret, Yeah, that's good., Wow, That's interesting, I did a lot on the weekend, so <Laughter>, <Laughter> good, I like to be profitable uh I like to do something where I really can, You know, making money, it's kind of like my bread and butter time, 'cause I do fairs., But if I don't, I might like to look at a few., You know I'd like to, go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game, Go to the movies., Going out with a few friends, So I would just, or you know, just step back a little bit, but my primary primary focus would be on, You know, earn money on the weekends, uh, That's interesting., proud of, um, I would say that I was living a healthy life by and large I would say I have never been in any kind of really, bad, bad uh, Motor vehicles, um, You know, i, I lived a pretty healthy, healthy life, I'd say that would probably, I don't know if it's really proud., But as far as I was concerned, the course remained as far as, no really deep <Laughter> alley to go down, so to speak, All right., It's my pleasure.,

like..., Basically, that, it was I felt somehow, Robbed in one sense, as I felt that everyone had other parents and, I grew up with my grandparents and then, for me to go so many years without really knowing mom and dad, to be 18 years old for me and then she leaves me, It was kind of like, I don't know it was annoying, because, I felt, You know it was., I didn't have them all these years and then now that I'm older and I don't even have them now, so, um, Signing the newspaper with a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter, I was so nervous, so scared., To really not know what to

so around it was great, see red orange autumn sunsets and, Ride along, you know uh, so many animals see yeah, in Kenya, Probably when I went to a, a masai village and I happened to live in hawaii, and I was on tahiti, and I was wearing one of those pareos, which are handpainted, and I had it, tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and I happened to, Entering a Masai village for the first time, uh that day and I looked around everywhere and the men wore their clothes exactly the same, turn <Laughter> on the same shoulder and they came to me and they said why are you masai dressed, and uh <Laughter> and around then they came back and gave me what seemed to be, uh, some very large, which looked like pearl leather bookmarks, but they were actually earrings, so they weighed like, my ears straight down and then they gave me some bracelets, And then they uh I had to wear something around my waist and they said now you really see masai <Laughter> so but I just I have a lot of uh I think live, get a chance to live in different countries around the world I just got uh you feel alive all your senses are totally you know uh awakened yes, I think it's not so clear cut I think a lot of people are a hybrid of both I mean, I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely bold, Uh and very brave at other times probably one of my best virtues is that I'm very good-natured person, so if I really feel passionate about something, I risk everything to go, sometimes to reach I think that, um, usually I do well I make decisions very quickly, and I think I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he told me how to make decisions faster, and I told him I said well in any case, You always have no choice and he says what you mean there is, Hundreds of decisions and I didn't really say, because it's belly wise just one, and it's not really important you waste time physical energy emotional energy, mental energy reflects everything if well wise you always know what the choice is, what you really want to do, and it doesn't matter if there is a ninety eight percent probability of failure, Even if it's a two percent chance of success, you have to go to the one that can give you joy, so I always go to the one that it's a waste of total time for me., and energy to even think about another choice, because who cares if you stay unharmed, but it if it does not bring joy, Uh, excuse me., You said you'd put your fish, What do I do if I'm angry?, To <sigh>, <tisk> I think if I'm upset sometimes it's me, because sometimes I can have, I can have a little more patience around, I guess you really have to sit down for yourself, in the shoes of another rather than the way you would react, you must have more empathy, I don't think that's why I'm so happy to travel because you, in other situations where you are forced to, to the, Understanding other people, lives much more, regardless of how different they are, uh from your different situations I've been in so many Third World countries and lived in so many different situations that it helps you to create what's why, Traveling is really the best education there is, Let me think., Last time I argued about it, A little, uh..., God, I'm trying to remember <Laughter> around, Oh, I think it was when someone didn't respect my privacy in something, um, Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., Oh, I know what it was., It was someone who belonged to the uh, Uh Scientology Faith around, - I don't know., Inherited, I may have inherited an immune disorder from my mother, my mother died of lupus., and, Uh I sometimes even at the moment I have rashes and everything and I'm very photosensitive, and, I had a you know an episode where I was I had big torches and I didn't feel really good I felt red and everything and the Scientologist tells me that I had to be audited, and, and he said something about are you aware, past lives and, I had told him that I was a Buddhist and I was kind of curious that, if you are trying to recruit someone to at least convert to your religion, you should find out the other person which religion they are to be even informed and able to talk to them, and I and he said that you know that, um, <tisk> about something in your past and I'm going to think that, many religions uh including Buddhists and Scientology believe that things you have have <ha>, had in your story sometimes affect you or things you keep that anger asking bitterness, through your previous relationships or your, Parents and such can influence and even make you sick you even have cancer, yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe that I said that, You know that you have the power of each person to go a god like or a Buddha like nature and you can make yourself, Even if I'm close to being maybe, I'm probably getting a cold., maybe every fifteen years I have no tendency to be sick at all, and a large part of it is I think when I think I'm on edge, I'll take, Like I did, even when I was a child when I was seven, I would., Folding I had my boo boo, and I would take <ta> I would say I would have the good part, You know, help the bad part <Laughter> out of a simplistic way in relation to a child, and I would actually, even when I was in a very serious car accident where I was cut by glass my whole back, I concentrated healing and when I went back to the hospital, the doctors actually had the nurses coming and say this is incredible that, only <jj> she last week her back was cut so hard this is incredibly healing thing, so I think that but uh, um, Uh, but I was just, I think, upset and irritated a little, because the Scientologist told me that, because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he had these certificates on his wall that he felt that he had more enlightened and, It wasn't even one thing I said if it was him., whether he took twenty forty courses or whether I practised Buddhism, whether it was for five ten fifteen, Twenty years or if someone has been practicing a kind of Christianity for fifty years and is sitting in a church every day, does not mean that this person would have, never visited the church and more spiritually than someone who has, you know, So I just thought this was the antithesis of, someone who says they're enlightened, but it's just the way I think he's getting his, uh, You know his belief in my neck that after a while I was pretty patient with him, but he was so pompous that I was irritated, especially when he kept telling me that it was being audited and that the same person needed a hip surgery, the following week, And I didn't show him because I didn't want to., into it, but, you could say hey you have a bad hip because you need to be tested that something you've done in your past, otherwise you wouldn't need to have a hip surgery I mean, I think to some extent things that can be caused, from the people themselves, And then he says flippy good, you're aware Scientologists believe that, Past life can also be based on, You know, and I think of myself, Buddhists of all religions are, are somehow as well known for you know, believe in a cause and effect and past life situations and I found my thoughts, he should really read when he tries to convert other people < laughter> from other religions so, But..., You know, I know it just wasn't me., You know he cares about the fact that he wouldn't drop it <Laughter>, But unlike that, I don't mean, <sigh> um, Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., sometimes having a little more beat, I guess when, when it is in relation to patience, I can figure this out right away, I guess I'll cut my father off when he was like a vegetable in the hospital., mm < sigh>, MM my brother, uh should be the strong one supposedly because he, is in the medical field so my sister and I said good, You know he's the doctor, so he's probably used to seeing this all the time., but it turned out that he was the weakest and also after, You know my boss, my father,, You know., You know it would make his body crooked., Fighting the artificial breathing device and all kinds of things you see, all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was very difficult, But you know it was after a while the uh, You even know the doctors and even the uh pastor of this particular, Uh hospital <ho> You know hospital they said that he wouldn't be like any more, even if he'd wake up from that he'd be his brain function, you know, negligible, Yeah, it was mhm., hm, mm, I don't think I really have so many things that are so traumatic., that happened to me that I, had to block it I really don't know what, It's in my makeup,, doesn't make me feel like I don't have to hold like I do I have friends who, have unchecked problems they don't even know, who influence their behavior or perhaps their bitterness or anger or hatred or fear, and for some reason I feel blessed that I, I can't even think of something that, I mean, I had something, Bad situations happen to me, but, It's not why they traumatized me., Influence, You know my behavior where I would, where I block it, that I am not aware, of something or I think rest, Negativity for some reason, I can't think of anything I mean., There are bad things that happen and I know they're there, but it's not like I have the feeling that it's necessary for me,, To block them because I was able to, You know., sometimes accept <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that have happened, Pretty easy I can usually sleep my own myself in any situation if I could take a one hour flight to San Francisco I could only, Kind of lean on the window with the pillow have the ceiling over and even on an hour flight out before the plane has even taken out of the ground so, I can just <j>I literally have when I have had little sleep and I have very uh high energy so I don't really need so much sleep, but, like I'm in Africa and I'm in Africa, <tisk> bumpy pothole unpaved street and I suddenly saw that I need a few moments of sleep I just requir put up something my, elbows against the window and say, I think I'm going to take a nap for <Laughter> fifteen minutes so and through the jostling I coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so I don't really have this problem, Okay pretty okay I mean, I could flare up without the skin, but you know, from the photo sensitivity and all that, but unlike that, I'm in pretty good Spirts uhh, have I ever investigated < s> what, I still couldn't hear you, I'm sorry., have I ever studied changes in my behavior, what was the word, Yes, Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., around <sigh> I don't just know with friends and all this, Last week just seeing friends I enjoy being with and just laughing at a great meal just you know a good time listening to music, Repent my whole life you mean, or you're just talking about it, or what you're talking about, mm, You know it's funny., Uh I find that a lot of negative experiences that have happened in my life, too, have been, uh, um, Opened up experiences that, they're also great that I'm not, for example, I was totally torn down by my business partner, after the melody of all my <wh> all my savings and I had to start over and, Sometimes people sat with me like, If you're sure you're okay, you're just pretending to be okay, or, if you're angry, if I was, you want to seek revenge, You know, because my business partner basically ripped me off, we knew each other's families that even, more difficult in a way around and uh, he basically stole my whole life savings essentially in a way and he was sent to jail and the f_b_i involved was interpol involved, I lived in Switzerland and my father was sick and I went back and forth and around, But you know, if I hadn't sneaked in, I wouldn't have gotten involved with him., I would not have had the many rich experiences and I sometimes think the reason why, I don't know why I'm such a positive person, but for some reason I'm able, it's not that I'm deliberately trying to see, the positivity in even terrible situations that I would not have gotten, to live in barcelona and I would not have learned to speak Spanish so well <g>, German, Uh lived in Europe if I didn't participate in business with my business partner who ended up tearing me apart, but and there are many other experiences and different friendships that I develop, during this time and in some way it was a completely different life, uh, another world that, that you know that I never, Um had the chance, You know,, Live through if I don't have my, You know, but of course it cost me money and then again I was always the kind of person who, Money is not everything and, I think when I'm least interested in money, when I made the best of it so, There you go., <laughter> and, for example, one of my favorite, Times in my life probably when I lived in Kenya, and you'd think that, You know a lot of people have that., really bad vision of it maybe look alive, in mud dung huts or something and live very primitive I mean it's not that at all, but me and you would think that with the least amount of, Uh technological <tech> technological innovations and things like that I actually mean and I really didn't have, They know that a lot of many material goods at the time I mean, I had the explosion I probably had the one of the best, Years of My Life When I Lived in Kenya, the same thing I probably did when I was about fifteen or sixteen, um, to, live your life with passion, and again how to choose the way I said earlier about, Making decisions, You must make these decisions wisely, what will, give you a sense of reverence and wonder that would make you happy, and you need it regardless of what the percentages are, even if you have only one percent chance of success, you have to go into this because that's the only thing that will deliver, You know happiness in your life, <tisk> the fact that I stuck to it and was brazen, whatever you want to say, the balls have the chutzpah the cojones to go and, Follow my, passions and, You know, and I guess people sometimes call them strong choices, usually, Decisions that are simple <ea> if you don't normally give pleasure where you remain unharmed, that's just murphy's law, that's exactly the way it is, safe, See you.",0
412,"Yes, All right., originally from texas, oh a few weeks ago, Well, I've lived in, uh., Palm springs actually so uh l_a there is much more to do and uh weather is much better, uh for work, Yes, the weather of the beach, a lot of activities things to do, mm Transport, and the uh rental is higher <high> much higher here, At first it was a bit difficult, but then I adapted., especially in the United States, uh new experiences uh learn a lot of things, Oh yeah, once I went uh yosemite, and up through San Francisco, Uh I really enjoy the beautiful landscape, Uh probably when I, Last year I met a friend in San Francisco and drove down the highway., saw a lot of uh sights, horst burg things like this, Uh Computer Science, I went to school in the '80s and computers were uh, a new and upcoming thing, so decided to do that, little little not too much, Uh, probably..., I think like having a little uh little magazine, uh, Well, I've already started it's like a little uh local magazine that has uh coupons and uh, go to extend it to various uh parts of California, Probably shy, um, mm good view, not uh, I don't appreciate going out like many of my friends, um, I actually go dancing I like dancing, It's relaxing for me, uh uh i do Latin dancing so i did it several times a week so on the last weekend i, Very good, I think I was arguing with someone a few weeks ago, it was a religious issue., um, felt good, mm, um, see, I can't think of any at the moment <Laughter>, Let's see., Maybe when I made one of my real estate sales, um, I was..., Sometimes the customers are pretty uh pretty difficult, and I think I should have been a little more uh, improvising with them, mm, Probably uh moving to California, Well, I left my friends and family in Texas., and just to start a new life in California out here, It was pretty difficult, but you know I've been adapted., Well, um..., I just have an aunt and a couple of cousins, so it's not too much of a relationship, I have a big one, uh, an aunt, This is my mother's sister., and uh, You know, i, Send your texts regularly, but most of the time I don't have much contact with the family., um, Probably parents, both were very supportive, mm, Probably when the parents were ill, And they died, no, Well, I both parents were around, got sick and got dementia, and, uh, it's, One parent didn't remember who I was., So it was uh that part was pretty difficult, Well, they died, so it's just... it's been about ten years, so it's just..., Now it's just memories., mm not too easy, uh, It's just throwing and turning I think all night and uh probably think too much about thinking things, uh, likely like the future things like the economy and uh, my work things like this, Uh tired, tired <Laughter>, mm just uh not so positive, no, no, mm, Probably uh, A few weeks ago I got a pretty good uh real estate commission, so I was happy about it, When I'm in l_a, go to some of the meetings groups or some of the uh, I like to go to whole food and, and try to go some new uh places to dance salsa, no, mm, likely to be more uh out, mm, likely to be more successful in uh business and a little more uh, Uh, going out., mm, Probably my boss is... he's pretty condescending., and, really likes to beguile people, and uh, <Laughter> sat him down uh as the king, so he said a lot of comments to build himself up and uh belittle whoever else is in the room, It's..., All right., usually when you go in, He likes to brag about how much money he's made in business., and uh, then say things like uh, see how much better I am than you are, They have:, Look how much money I made this year, and you're the worst fucking agent there is., Things like this, mhm, um, Probably uh I have integrity and a good heart, working hard, Honest, um, likely, I just left, I guess I went dancing., I was at a casino., in a small town called Temecula, I've met a lot of new friends and uh, it uh dancing and meeting friends, New friends, um, likely, It was about uh, Education I guess my education and uh able to move uh, to move here where I wanted to go, Thank you., See you.",12
413,"Yes, I'm fine., I'm from Greenwich Connecticut, Yes, I moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago, I try to go back at least once a year, sometimes I go more times less, Overall I think I like where I'm out better than l_a in general, um, I think that, other than being somewhere, I'm familiar with the kind of people that are there, are just more my, guy and what I'm used to and, It's less superficial., I moved here after my high school degree, and my mother and sister live in California., At first it was easy because I felt like, it was a new experience, so you somehow adapt and just, experience everything at once, but then after the first years, when it really, how different it is and, what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally, uh Visual Art and Photography, I was interested in photography since high school around I have a lot of programs and, receive awards and such things and publications, so I decided to pursue art, Um, yeah, I got a degree in fine arts that I got last year and, Scrubbed_entry, Yeah, I really enjoy working in forensics or intervening., I like this better than at first, what I wanted to do was freelance photography, I feel it's a safe job and it's very interesting, um, That's an interesting question., I think just my childhood in general, growing up, Well, my family is very close., um, also my extended family and they all live <li>most of them live, within the area or on the east coast in general so we would always great family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that, yes, it's really fun and we try and all together as much as possible, that's, more difficult now that everyone is distributed among different countries and countries, I think I'm more shy., um, i, Seeing reality TV I find it kind of funny and lighthearted, around I look like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and, like funny things you don't really have to pay attention to, um, I'm good, I guess I don't really have a temper when I, when I stressed more it definitely shows up in my attitude it but I didn't really like anger, um, Well, me and my friend like Bicker <Laughter> all the time just like, Insignificant things, but different from the, I had a fight with my dad a few days ago., um, There was some kind of tension going on., then I went and visited over the holidays in this last winter, Things about his girlfriend and, He thinks I should be the one trying to, have a relationship with her although he does not think for any reason that it should go both ways, so for the thirtieth time that he, We were on the phone and he was, I told myself how to call her and talk to her, and I told him I would do it last weekend because of the Jewish holidays and, he was very mature and told me oh forget she doesn't want to hear from you now and somehow like I might be less interested because i, I don't care about having a relationship with her, so if she doesn't want to hear from me, you know it's easier for me., um, I mean, every time when <t> I mean, it was the same recurring argument a lot and I wish,, that I could do sometimes, but I wish that the times it turns into an explosive fight, that I could just bite into my tongue, But the thing is, he says,, certain things that are not true, or things he knows how will tick me, who are really mean, and, that he shouldn't say to me, so, So I kind of lose it and I can't really, Mm like nothing to say, um, Well, I guess the toughest decision I've made that I don't, I just realized that it's the hardest decision to look back when you decide where you, After graduating from high school where you go to college because for me I basically, changed my whole life and moved away and did all this alone, so it didn't seem so difficult to make a decision at the time it felt like a progress of the next step, but now looking back, this is probably one of the most difficult decisions I've made, um, Well, I wish I could erase, the event or the sight, my grandmother's funeral,, Obviously, it wouldn't change anything., but, It wasn't, Seeing her wasn't something I wanted, how to have in my memory, around her she was a very positive influence and always, was not judging, um, and now I mean my parents are great role models just in general I mean they are very successful people, So whether or not we have differences of opinion, that we are separate people, they are good role models in terms of what you want to have if you, are older, Usually it's easy to stay the problem aseep, No matter how late I go to bed, whether it's ten p_m or four a_m, I'll be up like clockwork, At seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and I can't seem to, Find out why I can't sleep anymore, No, I'm just..., In the morning I'm probably a lighter sleeper, but I just wake up as if I just couldn't stay asleep anymore, which was never a problem that was so consistent, but now it's, I can't remember the last time I slept the morning after eight thirty., I mean, it's easy when I have to do things during the day, it makes it a lot more strenuous., but it's not really I'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday life, um, I don't know, I feel kind of very, mm, like that, only, no extreme highs no extreme lows it is somehow, a note country, I mean nothing like lately, um, as recently it is just I would say over a period of years I have a kind of gradually settled more and more, reserved only; and, not very outgoing, no, no I was diagnosed with fear, I had a few breathing problems for a day or two and had to go to the hospital., Because I thought it was more serious because I couldn't breathe, but, They said it was a physical manifestation of my fear, I think in the right environment and, with the person who does it when they are open-minded and the therapist, is helpful, And good in what they do, then yeah, No, I haven't been in therapy since I was a kid., I left because my parents thought it was a good idea to like, to deal with all the problems they had with me, But it was never I mean we just sat around talking about my day, It wasn't, I don't feel like I needed therapy back then, so I didn't really get much of it., Well, I was happy when I was home with his family at my friend's house for the new year., when I'm there, I can only, We save our money so it's a complete vacation I don't have to, Paying worrying about bills I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with every morning, we wake up and hang out., Just enjoy the day, in general, um, I regret the college I chose to go, I didn't, From the east coast, the entire collegiate system is very different and, universities are not the same as the tightly knit Californian school system out here, So, when I was researching colleges, I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College at home, or, You know every other school called College at the end of that I didn't realize until you knew the end of my first year., that it was more like a transfer school like you, You can't even know you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I left., so it kind of creates more problems for me, Well, considering I'm twenty-two, I'd probably say ten years ago., I'd give myself the advice,, Probably stay near home, and to have, really pursued other options, rather than just being fully invested in moving to California, um, my best friend would describe me, as great charismatic funny ending, socially enjoyable person who is different from how, People who are not my good friends would describe me, What I mean I don't mean I mean it's what it is I, I am very outgoing and have a great time when I am with my friends in my element but around strangers and in how unpleasant groups and things I just, I am very shy and, Not really., Speak a lot, Recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clipper basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that, Yeah, that's good., um, I'm very caring., i, I am a very good judge of character, what I mean I think I mean I consider it a quality < qu> quality for myself, um, I am very loving <aff>, I mean,, I'm not very tender, I'm more, I mean, I guess I guess so, Thank you.",10
414,"Yeah, that's good., I'm fine., Burbank California, Yeah, that's good., the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather, um, It's not too, City like Chicago or New York, It's big enough that we have beaches that we haven't locked., sometimes the smog, Transport, the fact that I was just here, like my whole life almost, not enough because I'd like to go to school in Chicago., and I've been to New York a few times, San Francisco and I made a road trip through the country, That was cool I saw a few states, see new places, um, go to places of interest that I only have, over or seen images of, um, I traveled from los angeles to chicago under Route sixty-six, and the best part was to see the Grand Canyon for the first time, It was, the coolest thing I've ever seen, probably <Laughter>, Happy, and then it was just happy it was nice it was nice, I haven't felt that way in a long time., I studied film., It's just, something I've always loved as long as I can remember and

<comie> <laughter> Comedian actor would be awesome, but, That's hard <Laughter>, I'm super exiting, and I love talking to people, I like to be the center of attention usually <Laughter>, i um, I like watching mindless TV, How to, Small children in Tiaras and around, Entendynastie only t_v programs where I really don't have to pay attention to all, I'm fine., i, Really Getting, emotional really fast, but I'm usually, be able to:, to keep my anger down and not like eyelashes on others and so on, for the most part, sometimes, I get in like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are really easy to care about, And I hate to apologize to people so the fights can take quite a long time, um, My best friend <Laughter> Ryan I think, and it was about, our relationship and only, how we kind of messed it up and crossed some boundaries and, How about we get back to the way it was before?, really hard, It's..., He's my best friend and I miss him., but, We screwed it up, and it's just not the same thing., It's not like the same friendship <Laughter>, Me too <Laughter>, <Laughter>, I guess..., Scrubbed_entry, When I had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend, which was not okay, I wish I had just, realized that this was bad, and would have just stopped there and not let it go on for weeks, which has led to my separation., And then our friendship gets really messed up, I don't appreciate spending as much time with him as I did, be more confident, um, I guess..., It was, November, I was very depressed and suicidal, So I told my friend., what I felt, and that she had to take me to the e_r, and from the e_r I had the choice,, I don't know, I guess I'm going home or being sent to a psychiatric clinic., and even though I felt that I had no choice, I knew it was my choice and I, decided to go to the psychiatric clinic that was like the worst experience of my life ever, um, [exhale] It was terrible, It was in Chicago and around, It was scary., I mean, I didn't know anybody, and they like all your stuff, and they put you in some scrubs, and they just..., start giving you medication and you are basically left to your own devices, there were only three group therapy sessions a day and everyone was there, Mostly men and... they were all really old., and, It was scary that I didn't know anyone most people there were not depressed, they were violent <Laughter>, So that was pretty scary, and I..., It was really hard for me <Laughter>, I was as depressed for as a month, I stopped going to my classes and working and I told my teachers lies, about being sick and I just called sick to work, I dropped a class and I failed my classes and didn't turn in any work and, I haven't spoken to any of my friends and, I was, Drink much and faint and vomiting everywhere and, I was just in a really bad place., And when I finally tried to kill myself, I realized I needed help., It was, um, I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager, And then I tried to kill myself, and I was put into therapy for some time, so, I thought I didn't want to go down., again this bad way, I just want to get better, So I had to do it I had to get help, I go once a week, I feel like you have the right therapist., It's really useful, I had a therapist I really liked, and I thought we could have gone really far, but, Unfortunately, she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles, so I have to, I have to deal with this new therapist, and she's fine., she is not, we are not going to sleep, So great together, but she's the one I've had right now, It's better than nothing <Laughter>, Not so easy at all, um, since <yawn>, I came out of the hospital and started, and I started taking medication for my depression, i um, I just couldn't sleep well., Sleeping is hard to stay <Laughter> Sleeping is hard, have really, Crazy Vibrant Dreams, who wake me up and disturb me, um, I just guess, sometimes they reflect, Things I'm Worried About, or happens in my life, but they are just, they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mother how we were here, we did that did this really happen, and it's usually not you dreaming that, sometimes I get so scared I like to talk in sleep and wake myself up, Probably <Laughter> like two nights ago, This is a, hard question, I think, November <yawn>, after I got out of the hospital, I finally had a good day, And my friend took me with him., downtown Chicago, and we went to the sailor's tower, and must look, about the like big windows you go out and see the city, and that was really cool, <Laughter>, super starting, He likes to be at the center of attention, funny and a little crazy, I'm not trying to regret things in my life, oh, um, I would say that, Life is worth it, and don't be afraid to ask for help, If you need it, don't wait until it gets really bad, I guess my ideal weekend would be <Laughter>, Sleep and then, Catching a movie with my friends, maybe go home with them and, Bake some biscuits <Laughter> eat all cookies, watch some t_v have a sleep over, and then how to make pancakes in the morning, and see more movies we see a lot of movies I would like to do that <Laughter> in my spare time, go for a walk I don't know, go to the beach <Laughter>, That's a difficult question., I mean, I think I have, I've done a lot of great things in my life., and, I've achieved a lot, but, I think one of the proudest things, proud moments in my life is something really small and insignificant, I did this training boat camp and, the last person who crossed the finish line had to like, Thirty push-ups and, It was a guy I didn't really know him at all and the coach said that someone wants to help him, if someone helps him, you have to do half everyone, and no one wanted to help him and I just decided to start with him to make push-ups, and I just, It wasn't because I wanted to get credit or because I thought it would make me look good that I did it., and no one really knows about it, but it's just me feeling really good about it, It was nice., It meets you <Laughter> bye",16
415,"Yes, I'm fine., Michigan, Two years ago, every three months, It's more homey and country as fast-paced and stuff., I work in the entertainment business, so I had to be out here., It was pretty easy because I lived in New York first and if you can survive New York, you can survive l_a, the weather of course beaches, people are much ruder and meaner than what I'm used to, but I like l_a, uh graphic design media art, To get to high school I was in front of all my classes and credits, so I had to take a college course, So while in high school, I got a two-year college degree to do it because I was good at it., Yeah, that's good., Yeah, but now I want to go into something else, um i am in school actually i am online courses now for business management, <Laughter> I really want to one day I own myself and my sisters want to own our own uh rental real estate and, How uh, Real estate company we own six houses now we have bought money with our college, and now we want to own our own houses and apartment complexes, Yeah, that's good., meeting new people who see different things you've never seen before to see different languages all the things the world has to offer, Oh, okay, me and my sisters went to Hawaii last year., to I think we went to hawaii <hawa> honolulu and to, then mmaui yes, and we met the people in Hawaii and they were so nice, if I could live there, I would, um, everything was unforgettable, but probably jet-skiing, in honolulu has been very fun, Yeah, that's good., Outward, Music, Music is a lot of therapy for me, to good my family is very musically inclined like my father and my mom family so, Music has always been like that, no matter how I feel, when I put music on it, it makes it much better, I'm pretty good I used to box so it left a lot of frustration, so sometimes I do that I also go to the gym and I do like a kickbox course, but I didn't escalate to the point where I like, bluffs out or no I can pretty much control it, Well, I live with my sisters, so I argue every day <Laughter> but it was about clothes my sisters and clothes always clothes, My mother my father are pastors of a church, I grew up with two sisters and an older brother who was a cop., and we're pretty close, I have a nephew, We're pretty close, like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house, but we're together every day at one point, when we lived in one, when we in mirigan my family is anyway in mirigan, um, when I cheat as I am at the moment I'm on a diet with my sisters, but last night I sneaked and got Mcdonalds, So I feel bad because they held on to it and I cheated, But that's pretty much <Laughter it, um, hmm, mm me and mine when I and my friend of mine put in them, and, We said things that weren't like we hit under the belt, and we and we didn't normally do it, and we haven't talked in three months., and I know that it would have been prevented if we had just sat down and talked to each other, but it wasn't so far, Yeah, that's good., um, Probably moving here, Move to l_a, because, as I am I'm really how close we are to our family as I Skype with my mom and dad every day, So it was hard to go from there to here and they take care of everything, to me and my sisters have to do it on their own, It was a lot different., Oh, my goodness., my parents my brother, my father my mother my sisters my family <fam> I have a great family so my family definitely, um, I want to say:, Two years ago three years ago, My brother was shot on duty., and he almost lost his life, but he didn't, and for some reason, As much as I try, I don't tell them, because I don't want them to be the way I need them to know whatever., I keep thinking about it and I'm gonna cry about how it happened yesterday, but it happened three years, just the mere fact of almost losing him., Mode, Yeah, that's good., not just I work as, Personal assistant and administrative assistant for a caster, So I'm on call for them whenever I'm never getting a good night's sleep, I know <Laughter>, To be a zombie <Laughter> I'm pretty much, You'd never know, because if it was work, I'm professional, so if I was tired, they'd never know,, but I am very angry and very grouchy when I have not slept, To <sigh>, tired, and I have crazy headaches, but that's probably not enough sleep and work too much, Of course., Very tired, Yeah, that's good., Definitely, I'm shorter with people like, Being in the industry, I mean, people don't really care about it, it's just about themselves., and when I first came here, I had the personality and attitude of the family and love and being nice and here showed me that everyone was somehow here for themselves, also those like the other girls I work with, so I've learned to cut people off and be short with people if that's not really me, But all I can see is that you have to be like this <Laughter>, no, no, To <sigh>, Last Saturday, I got a weight-in and I lost seven pounds I was as excited as, so <Laughter> that was the last time, um, Care too much, uh, I'm thinking more about others than I am, so she'd say that it's too important to me that I love it., I'm the person that every friend I've trusted in from best friend to only normal friend, So yeah, I'm the mother of my friends, um, no no no I regret nothing, hmm, Never take No as an answer, um, I wish I could, Well, I don't personally know that I want to lose like twenty pounds more, but, I'm just..., I don't know if I'm a little more., adventurous, Little more adventurous, To <sigh>, I don't think I had a time, Baby feels bad No, I can't., No, I don't think I have one, I'm sorry I don't think I have one., Oh well, me and my sisters just started yoga and, we make the beach like every Friday, but, Yoga is like our new addiction, so we do yoga and we probably go to a spa or something, this is an ideal <ide>, Yeah, that's good., um, my job, my career because I got a pretty long way at twenty, the work I'm doing, so I'm pretty, quite proud of it, You're welcome., See you.",3

How are you?, Manufacture from materials of any heading, except those of the same heading as the product, Yeah, that's good., About twenty-five years ago, Yeah, it's been a while., Actually, I'm not back yet <Laughter> I like l_a, I like l_a, mm it's a big city, so it's kind of similar, but the weather isn't the same, so l_a must love for the weather, Family I was a child, it took a little adjustment, but not hard, around the weather, um, I can't imagine anything from the bat, but I wouldn't want to go, so my family is here, so that's another reason I don't want to go., Transport < slaughter>, not really, but I've traveled a little yeah, new places see different people how they live their lives, I used to be at monterey California., last <la> or middle of last year, that was very nice, um, That's a good question., I'm not sure., There are probably, I can't think of anything from the bat that makes me think it's kind of weird, but <Laughter>, Astronomy, Yeah, that's it., <tisk> I don't know that just somehow fell into it took a course it liked and then took something more and somehow just walked down the road, no, There's not much work to do., It's kind of limited., Yes, it does <Laughter>, My dream job, I'd like to own, a restaurant, a nice restaurant in the bar, Well, I'd like something a little higher than, most places you go to, or at least in the area I live in most places, don't seem very somehow just like a dive bar just somehow, worn run down so, something beautiful, something different, something creative, something pulsating for you know, pulls a lot, but it's probably expensive, so I don't know if it's really plausible, I'm definitely shyer, but I can go if I'm comfortable with people, but, At first I'm pretty shy, Good idea, To a lot of times i, try, just, Lie back and you know you're breathing deeply., just somehow purify your mind, or maybe you just see a movie listening to music is good reading a book, That's what just takes your head off, Relax, I got much better at it <Laughter> I had problems with it when I was younger, but I'm good I'm good at it now, I learned you shouldn't., respond immediately to situations you should, You know, think before you talk about this kind of thing, My ex-girlfriend, when we broke up three months ago., um, We're relationship was just not very good, so it just went a predictable way and we were just arguing about the same old stuff and, it wasn't really a memorable argument, but it was an argument, so that's all I can think about and I haven't really seen it since, I don't know that it's nothing special, just a typical argument between two people who had been separated, Frustrated, For example:, Yeah, I guess,, Everyone sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and I'm sure their way was right so try to convince someone that, you know, of your ideas or what you think is more difficult than it is because everyone is looking out for themselves somehow., <tisk> but yes, mm that's a good example right there with the girlfriend that I couldn't have reacted a little different and didn't show so much emotion, There were times in my life when I had a fight with friends or something you know., or earlier relationships where I probably shouldn't have reacted as I knew I wasn't doing anything bad, but just more of uh, you know that you are more mature about it and don't know that you reveal your feelings so much, or, this kind of thing, leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when I was eighteen, that was a long time ago, I went to school in San Diego and I, immediately wanted to come back so, I ruined our relationship, and we're still friends, and I wish I hadn't., mm, I feel that I can contribute more to my family and friends, I think I could do better, I think I'm selling myself so short, Job opportunities are hard to get, but if I could find a good job, I would be much happier because I could take care of myself and others, so don't be such a burden for the people around me, It's good., It's very good., We're pretty open and I see my mom and dad and my sister pretty often, It's a good relationship, I mean, we get along well., I could mean it's not perfect, but it's good, <tisk> pretty easy I'm a good sleeper, around probably irritable there, It's harder to do tasks, It's kind of like you're feeling weird or something because you don't have that much energy and, Good, relatively good, Spring time always makes everyone feel comfortable, No, not at all., Never, I really mean, we feel happy every day, but it's probably been a while., around probably like superbowl Sunday I was with all my friends we had a good time so it's probably like a month and a half or so when I was really happy, I wish I were more, I guess..., firmly committed to my goals and I wish I would have driven better to be successful I don't know that I usually settle for less, so, I don't know., I guess that's..., the quiet behavior part of me that is good and bad <Laughter>, Anyway, I'm alive right now, and then you realize that five ten years have passed and you should have done something., I'll just stick with it., Fighting with my girlfriend <Laughter> Three months ago she felt pretty bad about me <Laughter>, um, i, I don't know when I was., When I was in high school, I got into a fight with a friend and, I drove., my car too fast and it was an area I didn't know and I hit a turn I didn't know that coming and I crashed my car so I wish I didn't do that, but, that was a long time ago, so it's not a big deal now <Laughter>, Stupid <Laughter> immature <Laughter>, <tisk>to my parents some of my close friends I have a good group of three or four friends, These were positive influences., Yeah, that's good., I'm a caring guy., nice person good heart, a little, a little unmotivated must improve on certain aspects of his life, make yourself better and, passionately I appreciate passionately in a good and bad way < laughter>, Well, I take care of myself very much and at the same time, Sometimes it gets the best of me, mm, Sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or something, You do more than, they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated, So that's an example., Yeah, probably, but I can't think of anything out of my head., # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

know., really enjoyed I mean I do things every day I enjoy, but really enjoyed I don't know, I don't know, I cleaned some things out of my room, so it was nice to spill an old garbage so that it was okay, but I don't know if I really enjoyed it, but, I felt satisfied after it, mm, I think I could do better, I feel like an underachiever, so not much I don't know, I am organized very detailed, I like to finish tasks, It's very important to me that you know I'm very caring., I have good intentions in mind, I don't like to falsify people, I don't like to lie, because once you lie, one lie leads to another, so I don't like it., But yes, that's, That's it., <Laughter> cool, Have a good day.",3
417,"Yes, I'm fine., Uh los narrower <Laughter>, I don't know <Laughter>, um, It's kind of dirty, but that's to be expected from a big city, To my last class I took was a sociology class, I'm not sure where I'm going with school, but I'm thinking about sex education, I think it's a really important job., I feel like, Uh, because there's some kind of uh, stigma I think about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies, So I feel like it's a very important job for, the world <Laughter>, I don't know <Laughter>, no, Lack of resources, It depends on the people, but I would say that I'm generally more shy., of course with people I know well, as if they were closer to me I am more going away, to play with my dogs, uh, I don't know if it's a nice day, I'm going for a walk., um, if it's not a nice day, or if it's cold or something, uh maybe you see a show on t_v i like or read a book or something, I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temper., I can't remember thinking the last person I argued with, was my friend, Probably last week, but I don't even remember what it was about <Laughter>, um, I don't think I feel really guilty about everything I would say I regret things, but I think there's a difference between guilt and regret., as I think guilt is more like a bad feeling, But regret is like, You should have made another decision., I think this can help you in, better decisions to make in the future while guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <Laughter>, um, I don't regret doing better when I was in high school, um, uh, I don't mean getting better grades, um, I regret uh, how to engage with certain people in the past, But I mean, I'm not sure <Laughter>, That's what I'm thinking about right now <Laughter>, hm, um, Yeah, I mean, in the past., Yeah, I could have done it., different decisions, I mean obviously some things that you know you're not quite in your control, but I won't feel like I'm not gonna regret things that I had no power over so, um, I don't know if I want to erase it from my memory., but, I wish it hadn't happened to me when I was raped., <Laughter> I can't imagine tough decisions., hm, I can't think of a ""laughter."", hm, I'm not sure <Laughter> I can't imagine any, I have a pretty good relationship with my family., uh not, I wouldn't say I'm really close to my mother, but I mean, we get along well., and I'm very close to my sister, we're basically best friends, um, hm, I think my mother was a positive influence in my life, uh, because she was always able to take care of me and she always, I didn't mean she did it., like mistakes sometimes, but I think she was always there for me when I needed it, And she did her best to educate me., I think she was a great positive influence, It's been easy lately., sometimes I have trouble sleeping, but uh, lately I have had no problems, um, it depends on how long I have gone without sleep, I can only, be somewhere from like, to like groggy around, really at the edge, and how to, extremely tired <Laughter> I don't know, I felt, Pretty good I uh, I'm kind of like general fear all the time, but it's not as bad as it's been, in the past, so, mostly felt pretty good, I think I really felt, more happy in recent times, I wouldn't say that all the time I'm really happy I'm usually just kind of, For example:, um, neutral, but I have the feeling, more recent positive, I'm not sure I was diagnosed with p_t_s_d., um, uh, I know that I uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like, since I was sixteen, Ahem for depression, and I think my first psychologist I saw for a few years, thought I had p_t_s_d, but I'm not sure if she, ever made a diagnosis, um, I'm not sure <Laughter>, uh, I am <Laughter> I don't know, Yes, um, It's helpful, uh, talk to someone and have them somehow, um, you can take part in, talk about something so you can figure out the thing that your, Feelings about things I think for yourself or how it helps to talk to someone because you can figure out why you feel a certain way about something, I mean,, I think you can do this on your own sometimes, but..., uh, Talking to someone helps me think, um, hm, I'm not sure <Laughter>, um, I'm not sure <Laughter>, um, I'm not sure <Laughter>, uh, I think I'd spend it most of the time., at home, but it would be sunny outside and I would go outside a little, and I would play with my dogs and, uh, I'd probably have my friend over., um, I'd eat food I like, like just food I like my favorite food around, Clock, Movie or t_v show that I like, um, only, Kind of have like a relaxing time, but, That's nice., mm, I'd say to myself, uh, to make it better at school because I was kind of an underachiever during high school, and I ended up at community college going like this because I want to, Lose type of interest and then, Uh not doing well, or as good as I could have, So I'd say to myself,, do as well as I could at school because I feel I'm able to do too much more, when I do it, and I think I would have easily received a scholarship if I had done well in high school, So I'd say good at school, probably warn me of one or two people who, Turned out not worth my time <Laughter>, um, hm, um, I think I'm, proud of me, for not, be, bitter and for willful, to, uh, Well, I'm kind of bitter I guess but I guess I'm proud of myself, for not being selfish and wanting, To make the world a better place, because a lot of bad things have happened to me and I try to stay instead., I'm trying to, um, or I want

they've grown now, I had twins, Twin teen teen teen, and I had lost my job and we lived in a motel, and, the rent for the motel was outrageous I couldn't pay any more the, In order to pay for the kind of money they wanted, I had to pay for it., um, Put my son under the nursing ward for a minute., that was the hardest decision I had to make, Scrubbed_entry, around a schizophrenic, and he had, He was born with an auditory processing deficit, which he overcame by training with a speech therapist and school official, and he also lost his hearing when he was four years old., Um, but..., and then, when he became fourteen, schizophrenia came, So he's in a supportive environment right now, where he's twenty-seven years old., But he's settled with his mental illness and now he accepts it., I had

there were some difficult times., mm, Well, the mm the difficult times that I've really been alluding to a lot and that was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and, and, they were in, Temporary and, in the good one was in the care and one was actually in an institution because of the about the schizophrenia, um, so, think I've lost track of the question <Laughter>, the hardest part about being a parent, at this point at this point in my life, there's nothing serious about it., um, the best thing about being a parent, I don't know, I guess it's just to see <Cough>, something you created to develop into a pretty decent person you know, a decent person., That's the best., Oh, many ways, Well, actually., I didn't have two parents, I had a mother., and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I had no contact with him around, but the thing I do, unlike what my mother did, um, she was a strong disciplinary, both oral and physical, um, and, she at her had this tendency that she grew out of, She had this tendency to be very critical, okay critical and..., to oppose <Laughter> and very religious, um, and somehow, I looked at people who weren't, and that was me as if they were, were life wrong because they did not go to church or read the Bible and this kind of thing, what was the other part, on the question, I don't sleep well or I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's that that's all there is if I don't take medication, I don't sleep, I'll be awake all night I'll be awake, I'll be up for

regret and that's that, um, After my twins became old enough to, start to the school of primary school level around, I took a few courses as a pre-law major., and, At that time I was married to her father, who has proved not to be good, fit for me, and, because of the burdens associated with him, You know this would end and I'd leave him., um, I left college., so that was my greatest regret, hm, stay in school, no matter what, stay the course, no matter what, that I'm a good person, I'm a good person, That's all., All right., Goodbye.",10
419,"Yes, I'm good, thank you., Around I was born in Mexico City, Yes, About thirty-four years ago, Yes <Laughter>, I try to go back once a year, but I haven't been here for three years., I haven't had the time yet and I've traveled to other places, but I plan to probably go back next year., Well, I can never see me retreating to Mexico City, it's a huge city and, I like l_a more there are more possibilities and, I feel like I'm at home here, My family moved here, as I said, I was very young and my parents moved to California to work, and then we just stayed here., I love traveling, I didn't travel as much as I'd like, but I love to travel., To see only new things that people from other countries meet..., feel relaxed and have no worries because you are on vacation, I love being easy, in other places, The last trip I made was a seven-day cruise., and it went to Saints thomas barbados saint lucia, um, Saint Martin, and it was amazing, I would love to do this journey again, um, I think going to Mexico the last time I was there, I went to the pyramids teotihuacan and I had not been there in many years and it was just amazing to see, the pyramids and I can't even imagine how they were able to build such large structures, I think I'm more shy., around in social situations I feel somehow uncomfortable, I'm not one to just, Go to the people and start talking, When people come to me, of course, I'll talk to them, but I feel a little embarrassed., Kind of out of place at a party, I've studied history., I've always been interested in history., and I just wanted to learn stories from other cultures and of course u_s history, So I'm very much in history, I actually work in education., my dream job would actually be to travel around the world and have a show like the Travel Channel < laughter> that would be my dream job because I would be paid to travel and it's something I'd like to do, do, um, So I'd like to do this as a job, I love to read, and I love to take baths so relax I like to take a bath and I read while I'm in the bathroom, and I also like to go to the gym that helps me uh, Dealing with stress and, It relaxes me, even if I train., um, I wasn't very good at controlling it when I was a kid, I would easily go crazy., and sometimes as an adult I still get angry, easy, but I've been much better at, try to think about things first before they say, and, Without outbreaks, Things like this, The last time I had a fight with someone, it was probably my best friend a week ago., and she actually has children I don't have., and for some reason she thought, or thinks that I think I'm a better person than she is and because I went to school and, she didn't do it and she's home with kids and you know I can do more things, I don't think I ever gave her the feeling that..., I and I definitely don't know how I feel better than them, but for some reason they accused me of it and we had an argument about it., um, I wish I'd handled differently, because, when she spoke to me, she was very upset and, I started pretty calm, just trying to argue with her and let her know that I certainly didn't feel like I was better than her, but towards the end of the conversation it somehow turned into a scream, match between the two of us and I wish I had been able to just stay calm and, Maybe she asked me to call later, as soon as we calmed down, instead of just continuing the argument., I was angry at first, but once we hung up, I felt really bad about the situation., I thought maybe I could have just left her., omit all her feelings and then try to talk to her calmly, instead of yelling at them,, Oh wow around, That's a tough thing, I think., God, I think one of the toughest decisions I had to make is the separation with a friend of seven years., um, although I knew it was the right thing to do I was, the fact that we were together for so many years and, I felt by ending the relationship., I would have wasted the last seven years of my life., it was a pretty hard decision to make, but I realized it was the best decision for me at the time and I'm really glad I did., Because then I went on to meet myself, My husband, Thank you., Well, I'd say, Maybe, Fifteen years ago I was, with a few friends on one, Association, And they met some guys and invited us to their house., and I really didn't want to go because I didn't know these people and I mean, I knew their names and that was it, but my friends really wanted to go and I wasn't the one driving, so I decided to just go with them, and, back at her house around, one of the boys, actually pulled me into a room and, tried, I got scared I screamed, he tried to suffocate me and I thought, I wanted to die right there, I thought he was gonna kill me., But luckily one of my friends knocked on the door, because she heard me scream and we went, so, it could have been a worse situation, but I'm still thinking about it and I wish I could erase it from my head, It was, We have a pretty good relationship, I'm close, I have a sister and a brother., my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older, and we get out pretty well, My sister and I used to be best friends, but then we grew apart and now we're actually closer than ever., and I have a pretty good relationship with my parents, My father., still treats me like a little child sometimes < laugh> what annoys me, but I think we have a pretty good solid relationship, Yeah, that's good., I usually wake up, a few times during the night, um, so, I think it's rare for me to sleep, all night long, Um, and I feel a little bit, how tired in the morning, when I wake up, it's hard, I'm not a morning person definitely, um, So yeah, it's kind of hard to get a good night's sleep, I don't know., I've got a hard time falling asleep, and then sometimes I have bad dreams or, I have to get up to use the toilet., Of course., I don't remember the last time I actually slept all night without waking up at least once., um, emotional good, I'm on vacation from work right now, so that's really nice., um, physically I feel good I haven't been in the gym for a while so somehow, gives me the feeling, bad because I like to train, But to be healthy, I'm good <Laughter>, no, no, um, It was, Last weekend I actually went out of town with my husband, We didn't go very far, we went to Santa Barbara., we really enjoyed ourselves around we went wine tasting and, went to the beach and just had a really good time, She would probably describe me as a good caring person., um, Patients, Very shy, um, She would probably also say that I have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors because I always do things for other people., Well, yeah, that's how she'd describe me., I wish I were more absent, um, I wish that, i, What else is it?, in any case more outgoing, um, so I could have more friends I don't have a large group of friends because I'm very shy, I also wish I could have more patience than I did <Laughter> sometimes I'm very close to patience, and I wish I could, Find a better job so I could do more travel, um, Yes I really have a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree, and I really wish I had, You know I took care of it a lot earlier than I did., um, And I also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend, I would have told myself to focus on school., Go out and hang out and just, you know, and going to parties around wasn't as important as I thought it was and that my education should always come first, I'm proud I haven't been to school for so many years., go to u_c_l_a and get my degree, um, yes, that would be my most proud achievement, All right., Thank you., See you.",3
420,"mm, Yes, I am., I'm fine., Manufacture from materials of any heading, except those of the same heading as the product, Around back and forth over the years and traveled a little, They haven't been out there in over fifteen sixteen years., um, somehow stuck out here <Laughter> then I had my baby and I just stayed, uh, Miscellaneous food for, people understand each other, as I understand it, it's a kind of culture shock., uh, out there just based on the food they like to give you a lot of food, This tastes really good for a little money to keep a lifelong customer, but out here they want to go up there and give you a little food for a whole lot of money, so they only make money <Laughter>, um, The parents had a business here., um, not heavy, I could get used to anywhere, the view and the sea, uh, Just..., a division of the people that it is <Laughter>, Just a few places, learn to see different people and learn how different people interact and interact with each other, <Laughter>um, uh, I remember a trip years ago where I went to Mexico with my brother, Yeah, that's good., um, Jump into a lake <Laughter> quite far from the side of a mountain <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., all, There's no subject I don't like., um, actually my dream job, Working with computers and helping people, This is, where my heart is I like computers and I also like to help people, I meditate to train, I'm running, I'm running., um, I'm writing read, Median, mm, I'd say very good., Oh yeah, that doesn't make it seem so good <Laughter> the last time I argued, has been, about someone who actually spits out a racial mess, to my wife, Angry, Annoyed pain, disrespectful, and especially when I went up there to actually treat the person I treated them with dignity and respect and tried to help the person at first, it's not a problem people are people, mm, I had a chance at school to really go a lot further than I did, and I leave something very small, and without meaning stop me in the persecution of him, um, Ignorance, <laughter> due to lack of a better word, Now that I'm thinking about it again, I could have done a lot to avoid it, but I was just young and stupid, to live again, um, as much pain as I have seen in the world, um, a compilation of all events uh just different bad things I've seen, i, If I could change it, I would, sometimes, I guess things are for a reason, Even if we may not understand, um, I have no answer to that., um, Blood family we really don't talk about, my wife, I don't know if she really wants to be with me or not, She thinks I'm doing everything in the world, but that I'm not, and really <Laughter>, I don't understand., I know my daughter loves me, but I don't know if she wants to be with me or not., because, when someone talks to you, when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in them voice and belief in their eyes, If you say something so often, that's what really lies in your heart., <sharp inhalation> so you can say whatever through your mouth, but it's what really is there, I love my daughter, she an angel I cut her umbilical cord, I went out there and put on her first shirt., I saw her come out., she looked at me right out of her stomach <Laughter> she wouldn't fight with the doctors wouldn't let her touch a little bit, I talked to her, I told her to calm down, or I told her it was Daddy that she looked at me and grabbed my fingers and how she calmed down and just let her do everything they had to do., No, the task is constantly changing, what you have to do that day won't be the same as the next day or the next one after that, it's always around, what is a better word for it around, <Laughter>um, Adjustment, um, The most difficult thing I'll probably say, is, scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for her not xxx learn the wrong lessons, <Laughter> See your baby smile in appreciation, I'm trying to guard my baby a lot more of things she sees, um, when I was younger there were a lot of things I saw no child or adult should have seen, and, if < whe>, I've grown up, I have sworn that I will always take care of my child and, I wouldn't disappear or, Let them be near such things., um, my old foster parents, mm, they basically showed me no matter where you come from, They can always strive to get better, um, a good night's sleep, Oh, um, it's coming., the same only tired and yawning <Laughter>, how I felt, mm, For example:, I have a plethora of questions and, an abundance of gold, in my, gripping and it's right out of my reach, because I just need the one, Plug to really just, to see what I'm capable of and I know I'm capable of too much, it's just, I have to make this connection., no, um, mm not p_t_s_d no, uh, I said yes, but, I don't think I'm more depressed or something than any other person who has all their different breakpoints., My daughter's birthday on the twenty-sixth, she took her out to chuck e cheese she had fun she played games she was on bikes < deep breath> she was crawling around through puzzle games, Man this girl did above all <Laughter>, um, Fun loyally caring, um, something to change, I'd like to be more precise, don't know who my mother was, Stop thinking about what else happened, and just do what you have to do., I'm positive I'm goal-oriented, Determined, um, I am very imaginative, very creative, < Slaughter> ideal, I would probably, Make a little bit of everything, Climbing Cycling, Hiking with my daughter places around, <Laughter> Human, I will probably go snowboarding and everything <Laughter> in an ideal weekend, my daughter, No problem, Goodbye.",3
421,"Yeah, that's fine., I'm fine., How are you?, originally I am from San Francisco, Originally I moved here in Gosh nineteen ninety five, then I went to Chicago, then to San Francisco and then back to go close probably about five years ago, A lot moves <Laughter>, Never, um, there's just nothing left for me, The weather is better in l_a, but the people in San Francisco are nicer, my husband prefers <pref> my ex-husband prefers it here, so we moved, I have an undergraduate degree in psychology and then I went to law school, When I was in college, I worked at a law firm., and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting, No now I am a stay-at-home-mama, Scrubbed_entry, no, um, I love it, but it's, difficult you need to manage a life to make sure that they, will be, a good and successful person, Uh <sigh> i it's easy, somehow the academics and so that you know that I'm good, that the hardest thing I think is to lead them, emotional, to help him through things he has, a hard time with the feeling that I don't have all the answers, just to see them grow and experience new things and, learning about life and the world it's just it's really really cool, completely different <Laughter>, completely different me and I'm not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him, he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all, My parents are dead., I didn't even talk to my dad before he died., I have a sister and a brother who actually doesn't know where they are, and I don't talk to them either., um, Probably shyer because I consider myself more reserved, I like to listen to music, I have to listen to all kinds of music, but my favorite when I relax is uh eighties music <laughter> cheesy cheesy, but true, It depends on who I'm with when I'm with my son., I can control my temperament, um, When I'm at it, my ex-husband or other adults mm yeah <ye> yeah I don't, So-so-so-so, Yesterday, And it was about my ex-husband with the woman he cheated on when we were married., um, I found out he cheated on me, and I threw him out., And he told me yesterday that he was still with her., Yeah, that's good., um, really angry, and just very hurt, um, I wish I had, spoke to my father before he died, I wish I had settled our differences before he died., the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually, To end my marriage, Because he cheated on me, um, that should be, Well, I don't know, I mean, I don't know if I want to erase something from my memory because it makes me, who I am today, So I can't really think of an event that I want to delete, I don't sleep well, it's not easy for me to wake up a lot at night., I don't know, I wish I knew if I knew I could change it, I could try to do something about it, but I just don't know., um, Dimples irritable, Uh, grumpy irritable around, bottom, mixed with anger < sigh>, It's, just because of everything I'm going through with my, soon to become ex-husband, Yes, there it is., um, I'll just keep it in., I mean, there's nothing else to do except [exce> I mean, it's what it is, so, I have to, how to deal with it, no, Yes, Ten years ago, after my son was born, or nine years ago, I felt like, I couldn't handle life., I was so depressed., I couldn't believe I couldn't do anything., no, I'm not going to therapy, I'm going to medication management., But I'm not doing talk therapy., I went to the therapist's, and no, they're not helping., um, Well, some just sit and stare at you and say nothing, You know, if I wanted to talk to myself,, others give advice that I think is just, it's just not good and not on the point, um, It was probably this morning that I was playing with my son., just really happy that I haven't thought about it, one of the other shit <sigh>, To in my life I could just forget it, so I felt really happy, ugh, I think they would describe me completely differently than the way I would describe myself, but, um, I think they'd describe me as really sweet, Because they're really cute., confident, Uh, going out., Because that's what I'm trying to be for people, so I think they'd describe me like this., I wish I wasn't sad, I wish I was more confident, um, Yes, there are a lot of things, I think, It would be..., not, not, give my life over to a certain person who is what I did with my husband, I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son, hanging around the pool with fun going to dinner, uh, one of my two friends two really good friends I think were really positive influences in my life, um, Scrubbed_entry, Your life is worse than mine, but we can always get together., Scrubbed_entry, is just really positive I mean, she's always happy up always looking for the bright side, so that's helped me a lot, my son, I went to a friend's home and we had movie night we saw ourselves an adult movie and dinner and wine, and the guys were in another room watching movies and video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening, mhm, safe <Laughter>, See you.",10
422,"hi, safe, All right., Uh original I'm from uh korea, mhm, When I was a year old, Yes, I've almost never been to Korea., Uh I love the weather <sigh> and being at the sea and the culture has a lot of things to do, the food there is a lot to like, um, transport in order to:, It seems as if, We have a lot of uh economic difficulties and the, the parking cards are super high I sometimes I really am, Annoyed by our government <Laughter>, by your shoes, You said by your shoes, Your shoes don't show that I've traveled a little bit, I've somehow traveled, I haven't traveled in a while., Oh, just <sigh>, It's..., it helps you keep things in the perspective of our lives here, It's exciting and it makes me feel, I really live because sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and we see other places where you realize that, You know, life is about a lot of different things you don't think every day, Well, um..., one of my trips I went uh, I went to, singapure and then to thailand, And it was when I was with my ex-boyfriend and we went around, he had <ha> he was uh, uh, a sales engineer, or system engineer, but he did well this year and so this was kind of like a company thing, so we went to singapore for a few days, and that was really interesting to you know of course, eh, It's a lot different over there, not just like going to Canada or something., but they had a big reception in the evening we arrived there and they had like a piece of the directors of the company, which was really fun and, um, after singapore uh we have some tours in singapore it was really, it was an interesting experience, it's really clean there and it's really, There's not much crime, but the government is very, it's a little intrusive, but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost < almo> it was really completely different because it is like jungle, We went to, It's a small island., and it was just it was very, Primitives compared to, singapore only in a lot of different ways, but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap, had a beach massage for eight dollars <Laughter>, it was interesting yeah, Yes, it was an hour for eight dollars <Laughter>, mm, Well, I'm in school right now., I didn't finish school when I was younger because I..., I had health problems., So around here I am, I'm doing my General Ed. I'm going to s_m_c., Yeah, that's good., I'm happy, ooh <sigh> well, my dream job would be <sigh> a vet, but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know, also because of the monetarly it costs a lot, but that would be my dream job working with animals and and, in veterinary capacity, Yeah, that's good., I think I'm right at the top around it depends on the environment and the people I'm with and, how comfortable I am, but around I'm really going out when I'm comfortable with people and I'm really being reserved <Laughter> if I don't, Yeah, that's good., Well, I mean next to sleeping, um, I like, like relaxing things uh like going for a bike tour on the strand, Or when I'm home uh just like reading or, many times I can just lie there and, my mind could do things, but I'm kind of relaxing, Oh, really good., I didn't, I'd say there are certain things that..., they can really, how to make me, like when I see injustices or such things, I mean, I can really feel it, but I never like flying out of the grip or throwing things or, You know you're screaming., argued, To <sigh>, I can't really say that I have arguments that I mean like a disagreement or an actual argument., Like if we just, All right., I'd say last summer., if:, um, I think it was after a, Baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to, we went to have Shabu Shabu after the game, and, I don't know that I think, Scrubbed_entry, And I don't know it's some kind of tough friendship., She's in a way a good friend and she's in mm we're actually somehow removed in other ways so I don't consider her, Like someone I'd confide in and you know if someone, deep problems, but..., Sometimes we just..., She's very sensitive., and she doesn't have the same sense of humor I do, So I think, she had told me a few things that somehow bothered me that night, but mm, You know I'm just kind of, That's just how she is, and then I guess I said some things they, have been felted, Oh, well, she's really getting, Slightly offended I think <Laughter> but around after that we didn't talk for a while, but then we, Then she called me and then we were friends again, But as she never confronted me, Difficultest decision <sigh>, It left my ex-boyfriend., All right., It wasn't, It's been a long time coming, I mean, I've been thinking about it, for as five years, um, You know, he wasn't like he hit me or something that he was a really good guy, but we..., had a lot to, we <w> we were not always on the same wavelength and we had a lot of same disagreements, so I had thought about it and thought about it and, We've been engaged, but we've been together a long time., I don't know., I was always it was always on my head how should I get married or should I not and then finally, Anyway we were just always with, um, We've always been what the word I'm looking for is., We just had this little sniffer, Inconsistencies all the time and then one day we had one and I just decided that I would go and, That's what I did., it was really hard it was the hardest, Decision in my life and I can stay that definitely, and, but I think it was the best, Deep breath probably leaving my job, for good to help my friend start a business in Nevada, and if i if i, I liked my job, I mean, it was pretty good, um, it was right on the beach., and when I told them that I was leaving, they offered me this huge increase and they offered me another position that was awesome, and that was really stressful for me because, I had already promised that my friend <Laughter> would go, I wouldn't have gotten the position you could offer if it wasn't, Because she wants me to come over there., it was really stressful and I stressed about it for about three weeks until I actually went, and, When I went there, as if we had made agreements on how much they would pay me and bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla, When I got there, she didn't remember telling me that I needed a certain amount and, the other directors of the company were, You know the <th>, It was a difficult situation because she had spoken to me, but they hadn't spoken to me and they're like good, that's too much, and also, they were another religion, and it was very strange I mean, they were all a religion <Laughter> I was surrounded by Mormons and I have nothing against Mormons, but it was very different because anyway, I was kind of an outsider and then, also the weather was just it was absolutely terrible there <Laughter>, So I'd say that's a decision it's making, It's just a central point in my life and I think that around, I really wish I had just stayed, Well, if you wipe something out of my memory, I'd probably say,, my memory, like really, if I could erase something from my memory that I want to delete, Is that what you say?, mm < sigh>, I can't think of anything., also like this, the bad decision I made, You know, it's worth it, so I can't really say that I'd want to erase something I mean maybe if I raped like or something, and it was really appalling then I would, but I didn't, Being in a deep sleep I am in a deep sleep a lot, but, I never feel rested, and that's..., It's a medical problem for me., I always feel good, as if I hadn't slept for two days and, um, there are points in the day, I would say in some < s> during some days there are points in the day where I really feel awake and alive and, and rested, but they are short-lived, But I sleep a lot I sleep, Uh pretty fucked up <Laughter> physically pretty fucked up, Yeah, that's good., Good thanks <Laughter>, no, I wasn't officially diagnosed with depression, but..., This is, That's usually what doctors do, um, As if my sleep problem has not yet been diagnosed, I am in the process of real work to get it diagnosed, but this is the first thing they try and, They've given me depression drugs before, but they didn't help me sleep., But I do., I would say I sometimes feel down <someti> good, my life is very strange right now, so there are a lot of reasons to feel down, um, I would say that sometimes I feel depressed., many times, but it's not, I'd say, It's reasonable to think about., the situations in which I am in, They are only triggered by the fact that my health is not great and it makes life really difficult, But..., I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything special., Oh, there I mean you mean for a long time or I mean I feel happy when I go out with friends or I go and you know I have, Find some great new dish I like I mean, what kind of happiness you're looking for, To <sigh>, All right., I mean, right now..., My girlfriend just had surgery, so I'm staying with her this week., I really enjoy it, I mean, though, We could never live together, I could never live with her long-term life and I'm sure she couldn't live with me long-term, but I'm having fun and..., You know they're just them I installed the Groupon app on her ah on her phone, Yesterday, Because she paid too much for laser hair removal., <Laughter> and so I installed it on her phone and then today she's looking for cupcakes, so she let me pick cupcakes up on the way here to get back to her uh as a groupon deal, so I mean,, You know there are such funny little things., Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., It's probably due to, o_c_d <laughter> and around, She probably thinks I'm pretty prissy compared to her, um, I think that they, Tell me I have a good heart., um, and probably that I am, I should ask her <Laughter> uh, I don't know we're going out, so she'd say I'm having fun., Um, but..., She mentioned that I am a very private person and that I know that I knew before she said that, Why?, I've got <ha> good I told you I've got a lot of problems right now, and <sigh>, So I don't really know, People tell about them, um, It's a kind of, It's a kind of Killjoy, but also, People can feel I feel that people can feel, less comfortable when they realize that you are having trouble and they feel somehow, um, it's just uncomfortable as oh they might need to help them or they feel guilty, but they have good busy lives so somehow creates a gap, but I'd say even before, Even before this difficult time in my life I was, I was a private person, I don't know why., I think, <thi> I think a lot, Oh, you know, I'm a deep thinker, and, Maybe it's just, you know, don't feel like I'm abnormal, but, um, Maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that, don't seem appropriate to share with people, or I'm not sure, 10 or 20 years ago <sigh>, um, Well, one thing I regret now is..., You know I didn't really find, Someone, You know, spending the rest of my life with it so I'd tell myself to focus more on it, because once you've

people and crowds, and so I usually make a destiny when I, remain reserved or open, I hear like a meditation band or I take a walk, or go for a massage, Fair, Oh man <Laughter> Uh probably yesterday or this morning, um, In general, it is about the argument, I'm making myself clear, or I repeat myself twice, No, it usually gets the other person in trouble, mm, I redeemed a service from a mechanic who repaired my transmission, and I had a guarantee, and I wrote to the Consumer Affairs Department, And the guy offered me a part of, the resolution agreement;, and I decided to bring him to small claims court, to get a larger amount, and I wish I had, took the offer he gave me, in the middle of, dealing with the third party, which was the Consumer Affairs Division, and therefore I took him to small claims court and I end up losing, the whole settlement and was offered only a very small part, So I wish I had, the higher, Street taken as the lower street, I don't tend to feel guilty about too many things., The most difficult decision, I don't know, financially emotional, mm, emotional release of a past relationship, It's the hardest thing that I can do, I'm not gonna say the most difficult thing, but it was a difficult thing., yes it was a relationship of seven years, But this person has moved on., so, They want me to be in their lives., in the hope that:, when something goes wrong with my current relationship, We will always have something to fall back on., Yeah, it's hard., around an event, something I could erase from my memory, um, I don't know, <Laughter> there are a lot of events, that I only delete automatically from my memory, but whatever comes to mind, right, um, Probably the death of a relative, to be alone and misinformed, because I didn't know they were so sick, and I didn't know they were numbered around their days, and I would have had more opportunity,, Spending and making time with them, better a better connection in the last days, um, It's fair to Midland, mm, my immediate I am very close, but distanced not very close, my mother, Yeah, she encouraged me,, continue my training, time and again on my, Hobbies hope for goals and dreams, She always

<f> I felt, Emotionally Attacked, Yes, I had a problem with a professor who, was just very, I don't know any other personality., and, He almost chased me down the catwalk at school., I felt, I felt like I was in a dishonest environment., I felt, as I wanted you to know change his class and get into another class, but I had no choice but to stay there, and deal with his meanness for the whole semester, I think by finding p_t_s_d, they tried to link depression., no, Financial, I'm not capable and I haven't found a consultant who's ready and committed., to work with me and help me with my

424,"hi, Yes, today is a wonderful day I just do absolutely wonderful, I was born in Cleveland ohio I was raised in Tucson Arizona and came to go narrowes when I was sixteen years old, Yes, I've only been back once since I left., It's a completely different one, Community, When I grew up I am so glad that I grew up there because it was a great feeling of community that I think we're not going to be in los anles <sniffle>, My grandmother died and left property for my father., So we came here to manage their property., It was pretty easy for me to be young., and it was easy to adapt, so I'm pretty good at meeting people, so uh, that's never been a problem that I traveled a lot as a kid, So I was used to moving and going to new places, meeting new people, seeing new things, it's an adventure and I like the adventurous life, Oh, one of my best trips I've had was in, Nineteen I am with myself, but nineteen sixty four < sniffle> I came out here to visit my grandmother from Cleveland, Ohio and I went to an Indian reservation, and I got a little note card about the reservation when I came home, I wrote to the reservation and I told them when I came back <ca> went back to school in September I would have to write, Uh, a talk rather about what I did in the summer and I told them I wanted to,, to talk about going to the Indian reservation and they would send me something and they sent me this, Large, Kachina Indian doll, and that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth it now, if I still had it, I found out like a quarter of a million dollars so, mm, but this is one of the best xxx, I could be a little bit of both., I'm pretty when I have to be, I can be walking because I'm good at meeting people and meeting people, but sometimes I have a little bashful side, a little shy side of me too, So a little bit of both, I studied business administration <ad> Administration with a focus on marketing and advertising, Well, I really started in computer science, but that was when computer science wasn't what it is today., and around me I liked <li> I was good at it, but it wasn't interaction with people and I love people, So I wanted something that would bring me, Interaction with people, so I went into marketing, and I worked for a t_v station where I go to school so that in line in marketing advertising fit so, No, now I'm a photographer I'm a celebrity photographer I shoot many stars, I shoot on the red carpet, I shoot a lot of special events and everything else people pay me for <Laughter>, It's not hard at all, it's my passion, I love it, it's like not working, I'm in my dream job, I just need to get more., Jobs <j> Jobs pay me well, because there are many times as a photographer that you have to do many things <thin> to get events known for free, so it's a process of building relationships, so I'm still in this process of building relationships, so I can get more paid jobs, but this is my dream job I love, what I do, Well, now I'm really back in it I've got it for a while, then I got away from it, but it's meditation, I practice meditation and try to do it twice a day in the morning, and the night before I go to sleep, I work with Oprah and Deepak Chockera and everyone else who provides me with meditation and I use that to, Calm down my body, I can generally control my temperament, sometimes I get hired, I think like any other human person <per> Being, but I'm working on trying to keep a moderate and moderate, uh temperament in the personality, oh wow we I argued with my daughter the other day about something I said and I didn't want to say it hurt her, But it has obviously, and we argued about what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt them mm and maybe what I said did, and that's what the argument started, Oh God, I felt terrible because I never intended to hurt my daughter, And I'd never want to hurt her, and I felt bad that she had been hurt by what I had said, so I had to guard my words and watch my thoughts, Well, I don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away, so it's just my two daughters here with me, and we have a pretty good relationship you know we're trying to work my daughter is a make-up artist and I'm a photographer, so we work a lot together in the industry so, Sometimes I think we're too close., we need a little more space, Yes, if I say the wrong things <Laughter>, No, it's never easy to be a parent, it's a job in work, sometimes making the right decisions, love the feeling of consummation, that you could educate the highest creation on this planet, to be a, uh wonderful and productive person, I'm not as strict as my parents, I give my children a little more freedom to find out who they are, I'm not really religious as they do, but I'm very spiritual, So I raised her differently from myself on the religious tip., and, I'm more I listen to her more I think than what my parents did it was, You were to be seen and not to be heard when I grew up and I let my children's voice hear, One night I had a bad night that changed my life and I don't know that I want to go into details, I feel bad about that night <Laughter>, Yes, I could have stayed at home <Laughter>, Wow I'm trying to think about a situation, Maybe dealing with how I and my husband divorced I think I could have treated this a little differently, We really loved each other very much and it was just something that made a, an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive, And I think we both could have done better, but I think I've played a part in keeping a lot of drama going., Because I was hurt, we broke up and somehow ravaged, because I wanted my child to be raised with her father., So I think it's looking back now, what you know, that the review is twenty-two visions., I could have handled things a little better, but what can you do if you knew better?, the hardest decision I've ever had to make, The hardest decision I've ever had to make was that I was on my way to work on a plane when a enrollment consultant had a stroke., wanted to establish a connection, and, to get into the other plane and then go to the hospital and a doctor sat behind me, And he told me, that I couldn't get on the plane, Because I could have another stroke that was a tough decision because I was all alone in Dallas texas., I didn't mean that I was in there with an employee, but I would be left alone because my employees had to go on., to Montgomery Alabama, where we went, and I had to make a decision should I stay or should I go, but my life was in balance, So I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital, but that was a tough one., ugh overwhelmed I mean here I'm on my way to work you know, I flew to different states every week, and uh to help get kids admitted to college and here I'm on my way to work, and I'm on a plane and I feel this, Strange feeling coming across the left side of my body, and I say my prayers and I go to sleep and then when I wake up to get out of the plane, I can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment that I did every week, so I knew something was wrong, It was when you came into your life., and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next, so it was very disturbing, Very traumatic, And I know you don't know what's happening to you, it's the weirdest thing you're riding to., the hospital in a, medical ambulance, That was a strange experience., Yeah, but I'm here., I know I survived, the doctor told me no one survived a stroke on a plane and I survived so, the universe wasn't finished with me yet, You know what that is, sometimes I have a little problem with it., Sleep a little sometimes i, I'm wired <Laughter> I'm wired just because I'm one of those real energetic people and I have to finish what I was going to do and until I'm done I can't go to sleep, so sometimes it's hard for me to sleep other times I can lie down and just walk, but depends on what's going on in my head, I'm sluggish., Probably a little at the edge, but I'm trying to keep a happy personality I'm a real energetic person, So I'm trying, but you know, when you're tired, your body's still talking to you., so, lately I felt really good, except, I ate something., Problems because I've had one since I had the stroke, I have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so I thought it's been over a year since I had the stroke, but I thought it would have gotten a little better now and it's not but I'm so grateful to be alive., that this is really small <mi> small compared to the larger picture and I wasn't, Fortunately <for> luckily, I have not lost my facial structure or, You know, my face isn't messed up, how many people are, I can still use my hands, which I can still shoot with my camera, although my left hand in use is diminished., but I can shoot as a photographer with my right hand so I can still do my job, So you know I have to hold a good blow, Energy goes on for me to keep being successful for me, No, but I've been through depression., I was beaten unconscious five times when I was a teacher., every ball there was that you could call football baseball basketball names, the ball hit me in my head and I suffered from, how to have sleep apnea and cannot sleep, so often to be hit and knocked unconscious in the head, so, No, just I'm not going to therapy because, I don't have medicine right now, so I can't get therapy that they only offer people with medicine., it's hard to get it < sniffle> and then I don't work < work> yes it sucks I don't work now because I'm still trying to get my disability, so that I, Get healthy, Because I want to be a fulfilled person and I want to be total and you know the system will take almost two years before I go to a hearing., So that's kind of depressing, to think after all the years I've worked since I was sixteen and it takes me, it's been over a year, it's been a year, I had the stroke February two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and I will not be hearing by September two thousand thirteen just to tell me if I, getting the disability or not, that was very depressing for me because I wonder where I lived from my savings last year, and I brought my daughter through college, she's done and now she has to take care of me and she's still looking for a job, and my life is kind of in the air right now, 'Cause I wonder what's next, so I'm just praying for leadership., I feel happy every day I wake up, and I can breathe and I can see, and I can go and I can talk and I can still shoot my photo I'm glad it's just a good thing, to be alive and alive in the present moment, You know what I thought, like what are good regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change here and now, So just go forward live <li>, What advice would I give myself < sniffle> let nothing in your way, you know that you keep a good personality and an energetic mind and just push on, energetically talkative, uh won't take no for an answer uh follow by reliable, good spirited, Lovingly Give, I'm very proud of it., I could find out my creative side, I was a visual artist, I've never taken an art lesson., I taught art < sniffle> around I was, in my late twenties, before I even discovered that I could draw and paint, I'm a doll collector, I am my creative side, which I am most proud of because it was able to help me., being creative I can do no matter what, even though I was still very sick of a stroke I could still walk, and just go take pictures and that was so, Reassuring for my soul, that I am I am glad that I have a creative side and that I have found it and have used it, mhm, uh huh, And that's that it's good-bye, See you.",3
425,"Yes, I'm fine, I feel a little tired and uh, Concerned, um, Well, I'm looking for a place to live, and I just don't have a job, so..., Things are a little bit, wobbly for me, I'll stay with my son in Venice., It's pretty good, but we both have to have our own room, so I'm looking for another place to live., originally from New York, but I've been doing this in California since the early seventies., Yeah, that's good., I moved to l_a because I had lived in Portland Oregon and I was tired of the weather up there and my son was down here, so it seemed like a good place., It wasn't too hard for me to meet people right away, and..., I just like it here, so it was easy to connect with people, the weather is <Laughter> number one as for most people I love to be near the ocean, um, I like the energy I like that around me likes the artistic culture, mhm, Uh good everyone loves traffic I love the weather and hates traffic, so I feel somehow <fee> I feel the same way around, sometimes it is, it will carry a little that it is so busy and the fact that it is so expensive makes it difficult, not as much as I would like if I had more means <fu> more income more means I would travel more, Well, most of the time I'm already..., xxx I traveled, let's see, so my longest uh journey, the, was outside the country was to Mexico and I traveled, went with a friend to Oaxaca, and the whole trip we have about mm I think we, took us about four weeks down and back from the bay area, Yeah, that was a fun trip., Well, we were working on the census together and she had made this trip a few times and invited me to come with her., of this journey I would say we were in Oaxaca for the Day of the Dead, So it was uh day of the dead with the family in the little village where we lived and, Everyone in the village makes an altar in her house uh for her, Uh lovers who have died, and, they also decorate clean and decorate the graves, so there were many flowers and it was just neat to be there and celebrate with this family that, uh, Well, I studied <studi> I was in the liberal liberal art program, but I didn't stay <st> I just stayed in school for uh in college for a few years, but I was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities, huh my dream job would uh personally support someone,, was in a creative area, and travel to uh and go to events with them, It's hard to break in, I'm starting very minimally with someone I do more., Voluntary, Work with me and I'm working on building some of my skills so I can do more of it., I'm pretty kind of an introvert, so I know I don't have any trouble meeting people, I don't hold back and..., You know xxx just I'm not shy <sh> how shy at parties I'm going to go upstairs and talk to people, um, but I'm overall kind of introverted so around, I prefer one-to-one, as, Large groups, um, I like to see it uh good i <Laughter> I like to see uh improvement shows how on uh h_g_t_v I like to see around, see how to renovate and transform or watch movies, or read, Oh and I'm playing a solitaire on my uh ignite my fire, um, I don't usually know that I'm mad until later <Laughter> so <Laughter> it doesn't really come up dead, and I just tend not to have the kind of life where, um, these situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road, I get annoyed a little, uh, I don't get so upset like when people cut me off or something..., But if people are deliberately rude and you honk for no reason, or..., You know, if they get angry because maybe I did something unintentional that you accidentally cut off and they..., they get really angry then makes me angry in return, hmm <sigh>, um, Yeah, like I said, I can't really fight, I had <ha> I was with a friend the other day and around, she got angry with me because she felt like I was correcting her, So it wasn't really an argument, but she, You know that I had said something that, she heard as correction also it was a correction, and she got angry at but, um, well then I felt criticized and I felt vulnerable, It wasn't me, it was pretty uncomfortable., hmm, um, Well, I..., in this situation, I didn't have to correct it., um, So [sighing], I think this is something I look at in myself is my need to be right., so in general, that's me trying to catch this and, Just leave people, Make mistakes without <Laughter> without telling them about it, mm, hmm, Boy, I don't know., That's hard., I don't know that I've had so many problems making decisions., hmm, Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..., has been, hard to decide for me, to uh, to let my cat sleep when he was sick, Oh it was <wa> and I had to give up a cat to, when I once moved and, And that was also difficult because, To <sigh>, well in the case of the first cat who was sick to, I've decided when the vet, said that he thought it was the human decision, um, and with the cat I didn't have to give up, i, I didn't really decide that I'd move to a place where, Where I couldn't take her, and so i, I found someone to take her with me., hmm <sigh>, mm, see, um, That's hard., if I don't really get the deletion from the memory part around, There's nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory, um, try to think of something I did that I, I wish I hadn't., um, Oh okay, I remember something was there <wa> <Laughter> there was a time when I was, I was in a class at junior college, it was a movie class., and uh, I was the one who was around after we left and made a little film project., um, And we're supposed to put it back in class next week. I was the one who had the movie., and by various, only things that happened in my life right now, I never went back to school, but I never, brought the movie back to them so that all the work they had done, They had to do it again and I still feel bad about it., Oh, it's pretty easy, sometimes I wake up, in the early morning hours and and have difficulty sleeping again, but this is not very often, I've been kind of tired and lowly depressed and like not feeling a lot of options, no, Yes, I have, Well, there have been twice that it once came back in like nineteen seventy, two nineteen < nineteen> yeah around nine nineteen seventy two or three and then around, Another time around, Oh, so, when would that have been about sixteen years ago?, um, just the feeling that it's not about, you know the feeling that things won't change, if I don't get some help and that if I, I didn't need to know that if I had a few medications that would help me., um, Short term, so, I'm not going to therapy now., Uh I moved around a lot of finance I wasn't really feeling the need to start thinking it could be a, another option, I feel like therapy can be useful yes, Well, when I went to therapy..., it was helpful to have someone who listened and, could also, offer impartial proposals to help me, improve the way I felt, To <sigh>, I was at the beach last weekend., It was a beautiful day and I sat in the sun and, just relaxing and I had my notebook and I did something to write and, I felt very happy and satisfied, I am friendly and compassionate and I am a good listener, and I'm smart and I got uh I have good ideas, To <sigh>, Well, I wish that uh, Sometimes I wish I was a tougher worker, I'm not really ready to take, Low-wage jobs, although, I need work so I don't feel like I'm ready to do something., um, and, I wish I could act, I said I had good ideas to have good ideas and I'm good at, Uh the beginning, but I'm not really good at following-through so, Many of these ideas begin, but then, I don't take the distance from them, That's probably what I want to change the most about myself, Ten or twenty years ago, I advised myself to go back to school and graduate., ends my training, um, and be ready to, to work, a regular job and to, to start putting money, away for my, Pensions, um proud of uh my kids and I'm proud of the friendships I have, and I'm proud that to, What's that?, People who admire me and appreciate my opinion, Goodbye.",6

with my life., I'm not working right now, I actually moved away and, I had to take a deep breath, I was married and we had to move because the rent was cheaper, so I had to give up the job., to take

very difficult because, um, I have a felony uh and so I can't work with the youth and I can't work with the elderly, and but the normal dopes I can, and then you need to be certified and I'm not yet certified, you need to work a certain amount of hours to be certified before they even allow you to do the test, you need to work a certain amount of hours, So right now, I'm just trying to get interns you know, try to help interns and show people what I can do as a consultant because everything about me isn't seen on my resume and around, Yes, they just want people to be certified in order not to be certified in order to experience, and the fact that I have a felony makes it difficult, <Laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility, um, or as an author, You know that the <de> depends, That depends on, on persons who are primarily:, Adaptation of my personality to the people I am around when people are kick then I will be kick when they are standoffish, then I may seem shy,

Controls my temperament, I'm very good at it it depends on what it is, I have to say that, The last time I lost my temper, it was because I felt it was someone., to scare my mother, so I lost my

be scared or anything, there's no reason that someone's scared and that we're angry and, You know we're skipping our frustrations with people who had nothing to do with it., I just think that, and I think angry outbursts to be a link around, heart problems and high blood pressure, so I definitely don't want, Well, I just told you about um., It was my mother's husband and, to tell you the truth, I could have handled it differently, but when I saw the look in my mom's eyes, I just lost him and I grabbed myself., You know, I told my mother, um, I don't like it., I've seen this guy abuse my mother, but that's her husband and so I kept my distance in her relationship, but when I saw how she was afraid in her eyes, that triggered a part of me., the, I don't like very much because I know if I get angry I usually stay angry for a long time so, I should have just left., I should have just gone and then gone home and rest and get up the next morning, went to church, but..., yes we had a

in five years and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and, How this is going to go out for me, I just know you know that I have a small family and, I have family in Chicago, but, I don't know., To snoop around the side of the family just because..., of what I have seen, and heard, so I just don't want it to happen to me at all, so I just keep my distance, Someone who had a positive influence <inf>, I'd say influence in my life, Scrubbed_entry, taught me how to control my temperament and how to express my emotions without expressing my feelings that threaten someone else., and, taught me how, how to monitor my feelings and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and if they are really strong, then I just have to be quiet until, that intense fizzling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not only emotionally, and of course he is, he was the one who encouraged <enc> told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol consultant to get him, Twenty-seven years clean and sober at the moment he lived on Skid-Row and he was the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something I'll never forget, feel guilty about, my grandfather, um died in two thousand four, and, At that time I just got out of prison, about two thousand two, I just came out of prison and he came to me and he, told me in so many words that he wouldn't be there that long., but I didn't get it because I had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was full of things that I considered more important than that, plus the fact that I didn't understand what he said, but, when he died, I found out he told me., that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go, but I couldn't see it then, and, I feel, I think about it all the time, something I can erase from my memory, What are you doing?, would be the day, my brother I beat my mother again and again that over and over and over again in my head and it's like, this is a memory that I can just walk without, over and over and over again and over again in my head, so yeah on that day that memory right there, I felt contradictory feelings, because on the one hand, On the one hand, my brother protected me, received from Beat, And on the other side he hit my mother, so, was somehow in the middle, Most nights I have not, I'm going to sleep maybe three in the morning and I'm probably more than likely until seven in the morning so I don't get much sleep, It depends on the environment I'm in when I don't sleep well., I'll be irritable at some point, but it doesn't happen immediately, it depends on my environment and who's around me when there are difficult people who will be a challenge for me

days and months before they start to happen, I know human behavior when I see it, and I sniff it out really well and it's just a gift that was given to me so that he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people, to get clean with me, because when they look at me, they know that I see through them, as I said like a clear glass with nothing in it and, Yes, that's why he calls me the truth <Laughter>, um, I wish I never had, I wish I'd never gone to jail., I wish,, that I could change, All right., my economic status my employment status, and, my teeth, which is like a

not so positive, and it's hard to focus on you knowing the right things to stay, Well, usually I just knock out, it's not that hard, it's like it takes me half an hour or fifteen minutes, but...,

could get more different things done, Oh, there are several, but mostly uh, When I come from Mexico, they want you to be different down there, it feels like silly because I went to a store where I was dressed regularly., and I told them I wanted to buy something and then they said that, that I don't belong there and I and as soon as they saw my credit card, they somehow changed perspective because they saw the Wells Fargo logo that they know I was American, But they thought it was the way you know it., it was <wa> it made me feel ridiculous because you're going to a place and you've got the money you're asking for something, you're going to ask for something because you don't just have to waste it <wa> kill their time, just because they saw a card logo, That's how they know you, It was just ridiculous for me, no, basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school, And you don't know that you know you're trying to control my temper and do different things, because if I knew what I know now, it would be different., Well, I ran away, but I went back to school and I know I got high school., and right now I'm in the process of doing other things so now is

438,"<sync>, Yes, I'm doing pretty well., I was born and raised here in los engeles, <sigh>to the weather, um, would be the number one I like also the varied uh, Cultures, I like the fact that there are a lot of different things you can do here., and there is a lot of opportunity here not only for me, but for my children, And I think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career in school, to learn about different people, transport the cost of living, um, Sometimes I think it's too big, and I think the transport system as far as the bus and trains around is long overdue, they have to renovate it or, You know, add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around by public transport, I travel when I'm a little here and there I haven't been abroad yet, which is a destination of mine in the next few years, So I just traveled inland I tried to take at least one trip a year somewhere, I like the fact of getting on the plane and going places that go especially somewhere I've never been., and learn about the place you know like so when I'm going to d_c I'm really looking forward to it because there's a historic city, You know things like that, My last trip would have been d_c < laughter> last year., I went to a friend and I stayed over, three < thr> I think three to four days, And I need to see the Capitol, He showed me everything you know about historical sights and sites, the white house., the capitol building around I have a lot of other uh government buildings to see, and it was a good experience the irony was that I had to fly to nine eleven and that had me a little restless, but once I was on the plane up in the air I was okay and it was all good and once I was back home I was like yes, but I miss the trip and I look forward to returning, To attend my girlfriend's wedding, she had a goal wedding in Hawaii., um, In fact, maui, that was actually two three three years ago three years ago, in August and around, I've been trying to get back, since then, and I want my children and, I just love it there and I'm really looking forward to moving there for a day, I have three sons at thirteen-year-old twins, Boys and my youngest is also a boy, he's eight, they have all birthdays in June the twins are on the ninth of June and my baby is on the fourth of June and so they are only a few days apart, but, 5 years apart technical, and they're just super super, typical boys everywhere active hormones puberty around so it is actually an interesting time because you know that the two older boys go through puberty, They're teenage years, about my youngest, um, still trying to figure out some things for yourself you do that transition period from eight to nine years old, So he'll be nine in June and then my elder will be fourteen, so it's a challenging time for me too., only the joy of seeing what you consider to be parents every day and seeing how, only with love and care and around, the right and you know, well I can't say right development, but only with, You know love and care as a baby grows to a toddler in, You know a young boy to a teenager and then to a young man and so that experience alone has rewarded yourself just to see my sons grow up and go through these different stages, and see how they developed, and you know,, to see some of the things they're going through now that so remind me of my teenage years, and it's only very rewarding and actually I'm looking forward to being a foster parent later on when they're older and off to college because I really love and give children back, um, There's probably a few things, but I'd just say, um, for me as a lone parent is to the financial, Well, I would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them to bear the main burden of the responsibility of just child upbringing, um, You know the, just the everyday things of what you have to do with the, Sometimes, when you're just tired, you don't want to be disturbed or you try to do things for yourself., You need to be reminded that oh okay I need to cook, or I need to pick up my son or I need to take him to the baseball exercise., This is going to go over here, this is moody, and you know that kind of challenge., As well as the finances and you know that you know that you are able to eat on the table you pay your rent and, You know, day after day, and these are the two that are probably the hardest things I'm dealing with., Well, I take it day after day, I just lay one foot in front of the other and..., I am extremely spiritual, so I rely on God and, Pray and meditate a lot, um, When I see that I need some help when, You know I'm I'm not up asking for help, so sometimes when I reach out to people or, You know what other resources are out there to help me, you know that I'm trying to do that, and so for me now my biggest challenge is just, I try to go back to school to get myself into a better economic situation so that I can continue to care for them., To I studied communication actually I was a major in journalism public relations with a minor in sociology, and now I'm studying Business <Laughter>, I just thought you knew., There would be more opportunities for me with the economy, up to jobs., and then I know you have the desire to go to graduate school so I thought in the long run it was a better, It would put me in a better position to give me more opportunities., with the communication it is a little limited and especially as you get older around the fields of t_v reporting and things like this around, are somehow, will be, You know, more difficult to get, So I just thought I was going into something more realistic, and, You know, but I like both areas that I really like that I'm writing by reading how you can say and we'll see,, around <Laughter> a couple probably, but I'd say at the end, would travel like works like a travel writer to go to different destinations, to try out different foods to write about different people, Cultures around, learn and live you know uh about the different people and cultures live < l> live under <am> under the, You know the people there and..., to be interactive with the children and something like that, so I hope to be able to do that one day, but yes to, It would be something in this direction and then the relapse would be a consultant to social workers something in this area., If I could cover all three, I hope I can do that, This is actually a difficult question, probably because I grew up very shy at first., and not as shy as I am now reserved, um, but not conservative, but only reserved and you know when I go somewhere I am, check everything that everyone else out, and then once I'm comfortable or acclimatized the situation then I'm like okay you know that I warm up to the situation or people, but I'm also friendly I can speak very friendly and starting I like, You know., I seem like a chatter box but I'm not really that normal when I'm in a big room with a whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention I can, to bind to one or two persons; and, You know, you'll be kind to them, but I overall I'm an open friendly person, < slaughter>, um, For me, it could be something as simple as undressing., all electronics and just sit for a few moments, Meditate, to pray or read a good spiritual scripture, um, if I am able to go for a good massage, Maybe get a facial, um, You know things that will, I like the physical part of it I like massages things that really solve tension, um, and if not, then just as I said, just sit at home reading and praying or, I like the beach I love the beach so sometimes I drive and go sitting on the beach, I like <li> even maybe, go and eat alone or a Mani Pedi or, maybe go shopping windows you know things like that, mm pretty good sometimes I'm just like grr I don't really have so much a problem with the temperament, as I am only I am impatient, Unfortunately many times with people and you know situations, so I can just get really irritable or irritable, um, quite excited especially when it's the time of the month for me I'm just, Lose patience outside of it, I'm actually pretty good I'm trying, very much you know where I'm at and, be very patient with people, especially if I could see that the person is, as if they were a new <n> a new cashier person at the counter or cashier I try to be, I try to be patient and understanding, 'Cause I'd want you to know if I was, I'd want someone to extend that to me., You know, with my kids sometimes you know that it's, it works both way once it's the time of the month, I'm just like ugh just leave me alone, Um, or I could have a short temperament or a short fuse, So I'm aware I'm trying to be, conscious and trying to monitor it, but you know how everyone I am human and there are times or I have my days or moments in which I could just go like ugh and, Just lose it., To <sigh>, Well, I didn't really have any argument in itself, but there was an ongoing thing with American Express, so I'd say, because there is no personal, Contact, But a company I anyway we, It was really an argument, but I had a few problems with American Express, which I had to call about on Saturday, and I stopped thinking that I didn't get that., Answer I expected and so I would get all the contact the call was just back and forth, very frustrating and I was upset and you know that the representative tried to persuade me, then I tried to persuade her., So you know, I don't know if you'd consider that an argument, but I'd definitely say that's the last time you know., I just somehow reached my boiling point., to say the least and was really excited and, Oh, that <th> that was the next thing you know to make an argument and then I had to call back this morning that you don't really escalate to an argument, but it was a tense exchange for one or two minutes, probably the latest contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express, um, or actually it was on Sunday yeah and around, I know, the person tried to help me, but you know if you're constantly being told different things and I had to call about five or six times about the same situation, and it will not be solved, it will only lead you there so, um, I kept raising my voice and saying that I shouldn't have had things., and easy was more so allowed me to lose control of the contact I really like to feel it in control of the contact, and so around it just took me there my blood pressure was raised, Excuse me, and that was just some sort of chaos for a while, for about thirty minutes or an hour after., just irritable and excited and excited and so I always try to know you, Go back and, to draw from them, and, You know, do my own sense of feedback and, see how I could know how to treat things differently, but that's one I definitely wish I had my cool and was more level-headed and, and not really raised my voice and you know to be more polite, <Sigh>, mm, Well, I probably had a couple but < clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they were probably my twins they were probably about two, and I was back in a situation with her father and became pregnant and around, It was just not a good time, and he pretty much knew you wasn't comfortable with me another kid at the time, and around me was not comfortable, with another child either, but wanted to keep the baby, but, He put me under so much stress, and you know, I kind of wanted to say, really pushed me to end the pregnancy., and that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy the child I'm thinking about, that the baby or what would have been I could not try to keep anger or resentment against him or anyone about it, but I know deep inside secretly when I had it to do everything again, I just would have kept the baby and moved forward, so that would've been it., probably the hardest especially emotional I could deal with a lot and I've dealt with a lot you know to, You're unemployed, or you know a lot of financial problems, but that was the hardest thing for me., Thank you., no, mm mm mm, no, Okay, you know., I was released in December, so I've been all the time, try to do things you know to get back on my feet, So that was a little hard I had to face a lot of challenges, and dealing with it and problems with child support and trying to find another job and go back to school, So I mean my area of emotions were just that a range and a very good friend of mine now that we both started, You know, in the same place, About five years ago, she was able to move forward and continue with her life, and now she's graduating., next month of u_s_c with her master in social work, so I feel a little envious of it and I have been for as last year, but in more recent times, although I'm very happy for them you know, and she's a good person and she deserves it, but xxx of course deep inside I wish it was me, so that somehow also has disturbed me, All right., I am really good with people I communicate well, I like to talk, I'm really good with kids, so I'd like to teach or be a consultant around, Although I didn't really tap it, I know I'm a very creative person, um, I know I write pretty well, I might be a creative writer, but I know I'm very creative, so, When I have the opportunity, I know that I could tap that and develop these skills like songwriting for fiction writing., um, but probably like interior decoration, all artistic just everything because I love music I love the arts I love drama I love plays, um, I'm not a big fashion buff, but I love fashion and make-up and so, I think that would be my strengths, and I would only know people I know that I would make a great consultant who my friends come to me, all the time I have a good ear to listen to, I'm a great mediator and I know how to do it because I've been through a lot., and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that actually completed s_c, but to, I know I'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and I don't know if it has, to do with you know with older parents themselves or how I grew up or I had very traditional southern parents, Who has instilled many great values in me, or whether it has something to do with my astrological sign, I am a Pisces, But I'm, really good with people only you know time period, You know, like I said, I have my moments, but I know if it's something I could go into and develop that I would do well., mm not really, I wish I'd waited for me to get married before I had children looking for another partner., um, and I say that I'm my son's father is great, but to, a great father for my children, but not so much as a partner for me, we're not together, we haven't been together for years, but, I'm just saying, overall, I think, uh, I had, yeah I think I'd say if I could let myself be traced back saying not to finish school if I had and couldn't follow my dreams and goals and do things as I somehow planned first and, I think this is, that I would honestly be the one thing I could say I'm not sorry to follow my goals and finish school on time and follow what I really wanted to do, stay focused and finish school and choose a career path and, Stay with it and stay motivated and let nothing or anyone deter you, mm, I think I'm pretty stable and consistent just, with overall I think about how I faced adversity as I face < f> i, face things you know to, I'm a pretty dedicated person I'm trying to tell you when I say imma do something I'm trying to keep it I'm a very loyal friend, I'm proud to have raised my children solo., All right., Thank you., See you.",2
439,"<sync>, Yes, I'm fine., I am born of los engles and in los engles, Yes, They have many places to visit many people to see many things., Smog, uh the environment has grown over the years uh xxx, I've been nineteen and fifty-two., I was born here in los angeles and see such changes as far as environment with smog, and, mm basically it is the, I was in several places in the United States yes, uh try different kind of cuisine uh i like going to the museum like the historical i am a historical buff i, um, I'm going somewhere else than where I've been all my life., Let me start with uh, I had never been to Boston before and when I left I could look at the historic uh the buildings and I went to uh, I saw it., um, anyway the lake charles and the and the boats and so and it was just it was a good experience and around, There's another place where I went to a ferry and it and I got my mind emptied on it around, My God!, I can't imagine it right now., But unlike the new Orleans I was at the new Orleans, I didn't go to the mardi grass, it's just, I don't like to go and it uh to mardi grass if they have a lot, Guys, I was just in a low season., I enjoyed this and I was on atlanta georgia, and I made a cruise, I went to the caribbeans and took the Mexico cruise., uh i my next cruise I'd like to go is alaska because i'm able to see uh certain areas we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environment, I'm going out., I have no problem eating alone., I have no problem meeting people., I'm just shy of talking to a stranger <Laughter>, Oh I have a favorite thing uh I like to go on the Internet and I like it, competitions I'm a person who, loves to try in a lot of competitions and I have been very successful since I was a child, I've won a lot of competitions and, Uh in the evening time uh I find like an hour of time and I just go online and just, I'm so good at it that I know exactly the right time to even enter it. Normally I try to enter it before midnight when everyone else is asleep, so it was successful for me., um, married and my children have <Laughter>, mm, I have a 27-year-old son and I have a thirty-one-year-old son, both of them, uh, one of them is married, the other is not, and I became a grandmother not too long ago, so I have a grandson, and uh my uh son he uh works for the county los engeles as a promotion < co> a property promotion promotion examiner, and the other is a computer engineer, So, and I've been married for thirty-three years, and, Basically Uh Marriage Pretty Strong, You know what, when you build a foundation with your children, and have a good relationship with them, and talk to them and find out what's going on., And tell them you love them, uh, son, I taught them all the time when they left the door, I love you., And even today, when they call me and hang up, they say, Mom, I love you., You always have to make them feel good when they leave the door., That you'll take care of me, and I've never had to go to any prison to get her out, I mean, boys will be boys, but I never had a problem., as far as they are in any serious trouble, and I'm very proud that especially with boys I don't know how it might have been a little different with a girl, but <Laughter> with boys I have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law, Uh the best thing is to see them grow and themselves become parents and see what they basically learn from you, and I watched my son as I said I was just a recent grandmother watching him deal with his son., and it seems that he has learned a lot from his foundation that he has learned at home., about dealing with his son to be responsible to go to work every day, and he knows that hey, I have a wife, I have a son, and it's my job to make sure I keep a roof over her heads., so it pays off, And I basically he treats her well, around my mother was tougher on me <Laughter> uh my parents around, for some unknown reason I think because I'm my sister and I are the girls they were not strict on the boys, but they were tougher on the girls, so they didn't let us go to many places and then my parents weren't type, who like to travel, and I used to look at them and said no I won't be like them I'll travel I won't just stay home I mean, I mean, I mean, there's nothing wrong with them because they, Love found at home <Laughter> and did things at home, but she never really traveled anywhere and my mother used her fear of airplanes for a, and I tried to get her on a plane and go somewhere and she said, oh I'm going here, I'm going there, but she never died, that she never did to make a trip, So I made it up to her., and uh I want to do something different and that's more to travel than and more to be out there, I was more of a social butterfly, my mother wasn't a social butterfly., So I made it up to you., I think before I speak, and then I'm the kind of person also around, I accept other people's feelings before I..., cover up the wrong thing I'm trying to, Uh analyze the situation first, before <bef> because sometimes you can open your <yo> mouth too soon and you can stick yourself into something you might not be able to get out of, um, It's probably something about my husband that he did, oh he, I know what it was, it's about, uh, good probably about some new construction that my husband is working on at our house., We had a disagreement about that., Men have their own kind of things to do and to, I had told him not to have a certain uh, eh person to work at our house, but because of the personal relationship he has with that person, he went on, And now he sees all the falls, And he didn't listen, and I didn't say I told you., but I guess he can see by my facial expression, I told him I said you were losing money., And it became one problem at a time, so now all the building is in the air because he knows he's done wrong., and uh but he doesn't want the fact that he knows well, but he doesn't really want the fact, so he says look it's my project no it's our project, This is one of the biggest arguments we have now., that I can imagine that this is new, I felt that he didn't really listen to me., and he looked more like that uh a cheaper economic way that he can do that without going through the right ways because I told him that to, You need to do your research, I'm the kind of person I do my research before I jump into something I'm trying to do my I's and cross my T's, But my husband he's not so he likes oh I can do this person this project for x amount of money, And he's a good friend of mine, so I don't care that he's licensed., he doesn't look at all the stuff he is, he just jumps in <Laughter>, what cost him some extra money unnecessary money he spent when and then I mean it was a lot of money, and so I was really very upset yesterday and I was very upset about it because, It was just wasted money that we could have saved because in the end we're all doing the same thing again, and it didn't make sense, um, I'm retired early., To I was very happy at the age of fifty I retired two thousand and two I worked for the state of California, To be an invalid analyst and what happened, I was able to get the reason why I could retire so early because I had worked since I was eighteen, and I had as thirty and a half years of service, and what was so nice about it that only took <n> to get West in as ten years in my health insurance, So I was able to get full health insurance, but the only thing about it when you retired was I was with Calpirg and I don't know if you're familiar with Calpirg, but, We have an excellent pension system and since I have worked with them for so long, um, I didn't get the full percentage I should have stayed until I was fifty-five, but I got out at fifty and I didn't get the full amount, but that's okay., I found myself doing a small part-time job., because of the economic reason and then I have wounditis <laughter> so around, I think that was the kind of mistake I should have waited until I was fifty-five, but I see it now as far as the health insurance that I really benefited because the rising cost of health insurance has increased, and I don't pay very little money, So I think about uh negates the uh uh uh uh the money I get, um, Let me see the most difficult thing, It's probably when my mother died because I'm not used to someone dying., and my mother around, Died in ninety-nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma, and, I'm packing her funeral around my brother and sister, we'd never see anyone in the face who dies., or put together a funeral and all responsibility <responsi> because I am the oldest it was placed in me, and I'm like oh my God what do I xxx, and so around me was kind of like left out there trying to find her insurance policy because I had asked her to make sure she'd fix everything., and she never came to her, so the hardest thing was to go through her house and try to get all that stuff together and find things., You know, I keep my things organized myself, but... for some unknown reason, she didn't organize hers and..., I think that was the hardest thing and knowing how much I had to pay because I had to come out of my pocket on some of my things, and unfortunately my mother <Laughter> this is interesting, She had a little barrel insurance, but she had a million dollars accident insurance, and of course she didn't die with an accident she had., a medical condition, so that was something, so we had to pay for everything, Yeah, it was, but..., and now I can with i i around < laughter> that will sound strange, but to, since I learned from it, so I made it available for my children, That my husband and I met, and we always land our insurance uh uh uh police xxx not insurance policy but um, What do you call that?, Barrel insurance we had that, and it just we have it for mm many many years, so it's almost paid, but xxx ten years it will pay for everything around the plot and everything, and uh another thing I did I even wrote my own obituary I know that sounds strange, so, my son, I don't want them to go through anything., I went through it., And my husband agreed that we agreed on one thing., and, he said he doesn't want anyone having any problems uh people coming and telling them what to do it's already written we have a living trust, I mean, it's nothing they can do but make a call., And that's it., I have no problem sleeping I sleep very well <Laughter>, pretty good, um, I was a little tired, but this is just because of the physical condition around I have found I have vitamin B deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency, so it is more physical, but not in the mental, um, Exercise walking more so, No, not really., no, no, I'm basically happy all the time I'm mm more, so I make other people happy I get more phone calls from people want inspiration about things uh, when they have projects they work on and I try to encourage them, Uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know, hey I really appreciate your input around, Thank you and then I'll track them and see how they're doing., oh uh resource person I was around, described as a resource person from my superior, to my friends because I'm the kind of person I'm researching everything I'm getting into., I just don't dive xxx into any situation, I'm trying to search for information uh, some I know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the Internet but also back to the old school as well as find this place, I mean, I've googled the card but also I love the thomas brother I'll never give up my thomas brothers card, yellow pages would be surprised, I don't give up my yellow pages, so there are certain little things I don't really let go, I know we have technology, but, Sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can find a lot of things., that although technology exists <gi> you have it right on your finger, but you can find things, and they say I'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to look for things, And I get this because I like to look for things and find it, And that gives me satisfaction, uh, I wish I could..., Stop, stop and stop my weight <Laughter> I will lose weight, I will go on this great diet before the summer and, and then until Christmas I am one that they call a jo-yo weight problem, and when I can stop bingling and make food my friend, um, I think this is just a nervous disorder that I just like to eat and to, but also I don't like being overweight because I have a lot of beautiful clothes at home, and I can't do it on xxx now so, I know I say when I go to this binge and try to lose weight for summer time, so I get into these some beautiful clothes, so it's mm mostly uh, not happy with my weight, that's it, I'm sorry I didn't hear you., um, No, not really I regret <Laughter> that I can't stay skinny <Laughter> I can't lose I mean I can lose weight, but I can't regret it to keep it I fall back on putting the weight back on, um, let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago, mm, I would have saved a little more money before I retired. <Laughter> and uh xxx uh basically around, Put more money away before I retire, instead of retiring too early, the proudest of my life, um, Meeting with many people who came in my life, Uh I have good friends I still have fifteen of the best friends I went to primary school, and in very rare you could find someone can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends that we were in a sorority together, went together to college, lived in the same neighborhood and fact that we just had to good all of us had our sixty years of birthday and our high school, Group we together a 60-year birthday meeting, and here all fifteen of us with the exception of one that we all live and are healthy and we stay in touch, so I think uh, It basically holds the same friends I think anyway we'll probably survive each other <Laughter>, All right., You're welcome., See you.",1

pregnant, he said he wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me, and so this decision was pretty hard, because I felt obliged to do so, and felt super guilty to not, and, <drops microphone> oops, and uh, this is correct to, hang on this earpiece falls, That's where we're going., that was probably the hardest decision you actually know what no, I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I've

Yeah, my husband doesn't appreciate it, and I've never done it at work or in a social situation., but at home with my family I did it and then instead, To realize that I'm upset about it., My husband tends to get mad at me because he's angry., and then escalates and, uh, Sometimes I just end up walking through the door, or go to my room, hmm, I'm sorry., Usually, after I had an outbreak, And I isolate myself for a little, I can come back relaxed, and handling the situation, in a, more, Quiet way, Sometimes it's very difficult, but I've come to the point where I know just to, Stop and get me out of there., And go and breathe deeply, and then really try to figure out what I feel, why I'm angry why am I, um, So tense, and then be able to verbalize that, um, good i i it happens a few times when I start getting, I had a very tense day., Um, and things didn't go right., um, I tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while I make dinner, And the children are all at home and they ask me questions about their homework, or they turn on the t_v or and my husband is uh, I'm worried about things I just don't have to think about., And once I said, okay, everybody in the kitchen let me out

get like people, Watch what I said, it actually made a dent in my stove <Laughter> , which is still there, So I should have done it., went out early and took my deep breaths before I did, um, It was probably when I was pregnant with my first child., I wasn't married., I had a very good friend., um, Oh I was I was, Thirty-two at the time, So I was uh you know I wasn't young I think if I was younger, I'd probably have decided to do an abortion, But at this point in my life I'm fine, I'll have that, um, and I had, um, I got pregnant by the man I was married to and still married to., um, But we were only together for three months., and I lived with, a good friend of mine, who I share in the Peace Corps, Um, and she and so I didn't know this guy very well, I didn't know if we could raise a child together., I didn't know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with someone else., Um, and my friend suggested that we raise the child together., To even suggest moving to Costarica to raise the child together, um, and so it was a lot of, um, Large decisions, who would determine the rest of my life, um, and i, the decision based on:, more common sense and practice, um, but I don't regret this decision, I think I made a good decision., to marry my husband and, Raising Our Child <Laughter>, They're older, now my eldest is seventeen., he is around <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he is very specialized in engineering, he gets his pilot's license, I'm very proud of him., Then my daughter is, 15 years, and she loves acting, She has a boyfriend., Who's

climbs almost daily, no, I find it extremely difficult that I wasn't., my mother had a very difficult <d> my father died when I was young, and around my mother somehow separated, When That Happened, So I had no very warm or loving, Relationship with my mother or growing up and I basically grew up I was, from a very young age on your own, um, I mean, she was in the house, but..., had really no interaction with her, so I really didn't have, Parental skills, You know that most people will be brought with you., um, I know what I'm not supposed to do, but sometimes it's very difficult and, I see my friends you know., very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they make cookies and everything is biological and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect,

than I am at home, I think I'm more tense when I'm home, but I try to like through meditation and things of this kind that I try to become, calmer and more patient, I think my patience is what, I have to work the most, I've been a sleepless person all my life., I remember when a child was lying in my bed watching the stars walk through my bedroom window and, I haven't slept well in a long time, but I realize that when I do sports, and I do something intellectually with my brain during the day, I must be physically tired and intellectually tired, Sleep well, And that's hard to do sometimes., And so many times I stay awake and read, I'll read until midnight., And then I try to sleep., Usually I won't get up again, even if I wake up at three., and such things, but I will try to sleep again, Yesterday I didn't feel as good as I was, I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday, Because I planned to work on my garden., And then I build a butterfly garden in my front yard., So I had to plant something., and I just couldn't feel like I was doing it, I wasted a lot of time yesterday, but today I feel really good., so I feel more positive I feel more energy, so, no, no, um, I don't know that I just got a new mattress., didn't really help me sleep, But..., it was really good because I needed one for a really long time, and it was just kind of excited to be delivered <deli> it delivered and furnished and that sounds like some kind of secular, But it was, You know exactly how, I'm finally doing something positive, because it's, It's something I postpone to do and postpone to do and postpone to do, and it was like finally, Uh, there and concrete, and it's like it's okay that I've done this job, that I can check my list., But also I have the children camp over spring break and, We just had a fabulous time and we sat around and told stories and around the campfire and made S'mores and such things and these kind of times make me very happy, <Laughter> I don't know about, I think she's..., believes that I, uh, uh, more intellectual and smarter than I think I am, Sometimes she comes to me with a lot of problems., uh, she always asks her advice from me she thinks I'm giving her good advice, And if she doesn't know what to do, she'll ask me., And sometimes she just calls me to run things., Uh or just like to complain because I'm compassionate, Um or empathetic, and, I'm just here to listen., And I don't need to give her any advice., I think a good listener and, good advice donors, I delay a lot, I start projects and I don't end them., I'm working on a lot of projects that I've started in the last few months, many of them are really creative projects and, I'm very excited about them when I start them and I will, Almost finished, and then, I don't know what's happening, I'm just losing interest., um, Sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to end it, that sounds a little strange, but, um, I'm working on it., I'm trying to take care of them., Oh, my God, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

peace <p> Peace Corps there were a lot of things I could go in I would have gone to get my master's degree, um, with a scholarship and such things, but instead I got pregnant and married, and I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed, But the second time I got pregnant, it was right., where I had to fight for a management, and I realized my limits where I could not be pregnant and have this child and did everything I had to do to get a directorate, and so I really wish, so that I resigned, um, and I wish I had held on to it, um, Because then I would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and, solid career, um, not, Base decisions on emotions sometimes i around and not I have had some really bad bosses, The jobs were wonderful., um, but, My ego got in the way, And I would've told myself to let go of this aspect of the job,, the, selfish, Reactions I've had, to the bosses and focus on the work and do that really good, about my children actually, um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal, Ahem and, Uh people are really interested and they were like awe that, You know someone who really did this so I'd always be when I was a little

<Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter>, Uh mostly when I travel by plane just the view and the air is amazing, it's remarkable, The first time I was in New York, I was about 11 years old., and I made sure that I got the window seat in the plane and only the feeling of taking off is just intoxicating, but uh, We're gone., around <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in New York, so it was kind of confusing to get used to the change of time, The first thing I remember was getting a piece of New York pizza., It was delicious <Laughter>, yep <Laughter>, Scrubbed_entry, Degree with a Bachelor's degree in Communication, so I can go to the military as an officer, Actually, it's like

<Laughter> it is, but you can be paid to do nothing <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., But..., likely, I was definitely shy when I was a kid, but I grew up with the experience of college, so I'm much more open, uh i write music and i usually work like this when i feel stressed, i just make a number of push-ups and raise some weights, I'm pretty good at, I saw a therapist when I was a kid for about a year, and I don't know, it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and I don't think I do it in the best way because when I'm angry I do, decide how only bottles leave my emotions in place in their corresponding outlets, not really, it was rather an interpersonal thing that, I don't know., Probably yesterday something related to sports the playoffs are on things like that nature, To <sigh>, hm < sigh>, so many..., I guess in my senior year of high school I waited until the last minute to apply for u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because I didn't turn into applications and I'm

family, and <sigh> the next thing I had to get a mother, and it was hard, but, It will take seven years for the next to come to the thirtieth., and I've grown a little bit no more tears, I'm a foster child, so I was emancipated by the nursing program about two years ago., but around my immediate family I'm pretty close to them, and I see them as much as I can and uh my foster family they're awesome, I've known them since I was five, so it was pretty cool, pretty easy I fall asleep pretty fast, it's no problem unless my back hurts you know, then it's a problem, mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning I think I drive more aggressive <laughter>, Uh a little stressed about a few problems I can take over, but I shouldn't stress because I can either do something about it or I can't and

I had, Three no-shows in court that sucked, Tickets that are thousands of dollars and I don't have any money like that, I don't know., it's pretty hard to deal with when you're trying to make something of your life, but, There are so many barriers and obstacles that like you have not forgotten, so I don't know that it is sometimes stressful and, Yeah, that's good., think about it for periods of time some days I just sit and I'm just lost in my mind and I don't really communicate, to everyone because there's nothing anyone can really do for me, So I just fill it up like I do, all, not very after doing it for so long it will be a natural thing i think, no, no, Hm really happy oh, Why is that such a difficult question?, I don't know, I'm pretty satisfied with everything I don't know about extreme happiness right now, every day is exactly the same day, Looks like it's..., Uh Dunking, on the other side of the Clippers Center there is a basketball court there, and uh I've been

school, I wasn't the best student, but..., I had a teacher who was diligent and how he let me down throughout the year, but I learned a lot and uh I developed a passion for school afterwards, so it was like a situation that I overcome after I felt so bad, and bottom, uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad because if it wasn't for his stars, I don't think I had, To be the discipline where I'm now in college and so that he was pretty influential., uh, I remember this time I was in the desert or uh uh uh up in Joshua tree with my best friend and his father, and we are actually

was trying to move a skirt, That was thousands of pounds that didn't work., but yes we finally came out we thought we were stuck in the desert, but it was a fun time to drive in the desert, if I

decisions., Uh me and my wife we, we do not argue that we do not agree, and it's, She's very strong-willed and she's a game for me, so we go back and forth, but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh, Uh say mean things or hurt each other we're just her is, a determined, willful woman and <sniff>, I'm who I am so, we go back and forth and, lately, I've been the one to <sigh>, Bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long term, It's just her and me, and there's no one more important to me., When I was younger, I wish I wasn't following the people I was following., And what I mean by that is that you know that you're running in a circle with certain people and, with an ego greater than my common sense, and, That got me in trouble <sniff> I was a single child and uh, I enjoyed being the center of attention and, always the girls laugh or people think I was cool or whatever you wouldn't think I'm kind of overweight and bald now, but, when I was in my twenties, I was a completely different person and, <sniff>, If I had had a few brothers and sisters, I might not have thought or acted like that, but I was a single child., i, You know where he went., People thought I was cool and that got me in trouble, The hardest decision I've ever had to make was, has granted approval;, um, let my uncle die, he was on life support and his kidneys had failed, < sigh> and around, Doctors said he couldn't do anything and didn't have him., <sigh> goes through every suffering, to, Let him slide., And as you can see, I get very angry with my uncle, raised me as his own son, and, Don't ever let me down, And he's gone and, because of lack of a better word to push the button, I never thought I had to do that <sniff>, But like I said, I'll get over

activity or something that, really uh emphasizes me or straines my body, say it for a few days I'm just very relaxed and you don't know much to do, I get up automatically after four and a half five hours., I mean, and you know my wife's gonna say you know the guy you're not sleeping, but, I mean, I don't feel tired I don't feel exhausted I don't feel like I have to sleep again, I stay up all day and, I'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep, but, You know for me that it's me., It doesn't affect me., Well, I wish some things could be different, but I'm not dissatisfied about, I'm happy with my life there, like with everyone else, there are a few things I wish I could be different and I think that's in everyone that everyone else knows., but around <sniff>, I'm I'm I'm I'm happy, Yes, I feel a little less motivated <sniff> around, recently good I can not say recently this was back in January, um, my wife and a couple of uh friends were, I noticed that I..., always forgetful and I couldn't remember anything, I didn't see it and..., You know, when they all brought it to my attention,, But still, I went to the doctor and..., they gave me the tests, and apparently I have m_c_i, which is a mild cognitive impairment and uh, I've been, over the last month or so, No one told me, I mean, maybe I'm getting better, but, The neurologist I saw makes me come back in a year and will test me again., hopefully it's not the beginning of alzheimer's I'm still a little young for that I'm only fifty < fif> fifty two, but, I was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh, It could have been that I was told about him., uh, because of the death of my uncle I could have been quite depressed, I was not able to keep things and, All right, I'll go back in a year, and we'll see if I'm feeling better., I'm sorry., I don't understand you, I'm sorry., How <h, No no I didn't have, Yes, Two thousand one, um, I was, in a..., what is the word I'm looking for <sniff>, I was in a..., in a state of mind where I can only get in trouble and benefit from it if I did not seek help, around me was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder, uh worrying and thinking too much about things and, I think the worst and uh, I'm taking medication for it., Well, you know, it's not really therapy., You know every few months you have to go to the doctor., Do everything well and know that they only replenish your recipe <Laughter>, It's, you know it, it's, you know it, like the next person, the next person, it's, I'm with Emperor so, They'll talk to you, but they'll give you the impression that, um, You know I'm okay, let's keep driving and know they'll hear your explanation, but, you know, it they didn't have all the time for you that you can wish for, so i i i i am good now if i really needed help I would, I would do something that would work for me., <Sigh>, the last time I felt really happy, Well, it would depend on what the event is, I'm always happy to do something with me and my wife and we enjoy each other and I know I'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and I have nothing else, she's my world, but..., I enjoy being with her and we're doing things together and I'm happy all the time when we do it around, when I'm outside this circle, I don't know if that sounds right, but I'm not looking for luck, I can only explain it because I'm satisfied., I'm not, um, I'm not disappointed or I don't want anything, I'm you know what's coming my way is okay so, Well, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,, I don't know that I couldn't give you that answer <Laughter> around <sniff>, Well, my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff>, She would..., Describe me as uh, I don't think until I speak, um i um, Leave the smallest insignificant things, annoy me and I get angry over, But the big things it's like, I let it go and she's confused by this <Coughs>, Uh <vocal fry> years and years ago, um, she I had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten in a little Fender Bender, And she thought it would be the end of the world, because that was my baby., and i <sigh>, You know, hey don't worry, we're gonna fix it and she was thinking, <Laughter> that I wanted to hang her up or something you know because that was mine, that was that you know that was my baby., And she's leaving, you know her, You'll be excited about nothing, but you know I'll destroy something like your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money, You know it crashed, and you don't care., so, That's the only way to explain it., Well, I need to lose some weight as you can see <Laughter> I'm definitely on a meal binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably on the occasion with my uncle, um, I'm heavy, I'm the hardest I've ever had in my life., and I find it a little more difficult, I can't say harder, but I find the willpower, To say no and stay and train, or, You don't know that you're going to move now maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were, a little younger we loved going for walks < clears throat> and we lived in a, Scrubbed_entry, Boy, look at this miracle, what's in there, you know it's not like that anymore., I guess we're a little older now and, <Laughter> a little harder it's harder to go with all this weight <Laughter> but I wish I could change that because uh, I know it's just not healthy in size <sigh>, <sigh> uh lately, No, I haven't regretted anything lately., everything was all right, the, as I say, the, the largest, greatest influence in my life was the event with my uncle and uh I never, in a hundred years or ever thought that I would, Face that, Situation and < sniff> I'll never forget it, but, they say time heals all wounds and it does < laughter>, Don't listen to other people., uh, again I'm not trying to raise my uncle just because of what happened, but he used to tell me all the time, uh, he would see the things I did and the paths I went down and I kept thinking I knew better and I think many teenagers think that anyway they, The young lady I talked to here thinks,, They're invincible and I thought I'd never have these problems., um, I wish I could have changed a few things., The story of my past follows me, as everyone does., and that has limited me on many occasions and many things I am able to do, I don't miss her, but, If I could go back ten or twenty years, I definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions I've made., my welding certificates around I am uh certified by the American welding company and I have uh < sniff>, This is probably the greatest achievement I've made for you, I know myself as a performance from around < clears throal>, People I know say I'm uh, Well, I haven't been working on cars lately, but they said I was a natural crack for uh, Restoration and work on vehicles and I don't see it, but, I was told that, once or twice, but I kind of did, I kind of started slipping away, I can't say it's because of lack of interest, but, I just don't feel the motivation anymore, I wish I had a bag of money and I had someone else to do it, so I feel <Laughter>, All right., Thank you., See you.",18
449,"<sync>, All right., Yes, I am., I'm good, thank you., < slaughter>, originally from los angeles and my parents are from Central America, Yes, the weather around I like that I can come to the water if I want to uh to the hills or hike or just get any element I want to get, I can get, Traffic <Laughter> busy everyone is always in a hurry to, That's what this is about., < slaughter>, if I can have family in Central America and if I try my husband and I,, Go to warm places like Mexico or somewhere on the Caribbean, the freedom not to have my daily routine and not to be guilty of not doing something I said I would do when I'm home and when I'm too far away from home to do it, then I have nothing to fear <Laughter>, Recently I went back to Honduras, that's where my family came from., So it was kind of like a it's a double fold I get to see my family, but I also somehow get to be away from home, so I do it by not imposing on them I visit them but I stay in a hotel so that somehow I can still have my freedom, and I don't feel obliged to be with them, so it's more fun this way, experiences on holiday or, for the most memorable experience, Probably hawaii in lahaina and only with I love eating I'm a foodie so, to let the pig roast under the ground and just eat it so that I could never taste it as usual, so it's like a memory, it's a deep memory for me, because, No matter what I do with my pig, it will never taste like the pig in Lahaina <Laughter>, Business and that was years ago, so I ended up in marketing, So I enjoyed i my business background has helped me in marketing, My dream job, hmm, Well, I guess it would have to do with food I love to cook, and the only reason I hesitate is because I love cooking, but I just do it for home and friends and family, if it turns into, if it turns into a job, I feel like it just won't be as happy or I wouldn't have as much fun as I did you know how I've got now, but if I could just do it as a job and still have the fun and joy I have in cooking now every day, then that would be my dream job, I'm going out., < slaughter>, <Laughter> that's cool <Laughter>, Uh depends on where I am when I'm where I'm actually the first thing I do is just somehow get a grip of myself that I'm always in control no matter where I stand by, and always say that I am my own peace p a p e a c e, So I just take a deep breath to assess my situation., find out what I can control, what I can't control and then proceed from there, but just breathe some sort of deep breath and get me under control., I'm actually very good I'm actually very mild-tempered to start with, I'm not really getting upset., and so when I just feel hot all the time or when I just react I just like I said I just, do my own little self-control you know, before I may have kissed, I might have gone for a second, but I'm saying my own little self-control and just you know what comes on no that's mm it's not worth it, this person isn't worth it, the situation is not worth it, Be who you are and just stay there, actually it was with my husband and we went back and forth about my relationship with my father and I tried to get a point about him and he was just somehow missing my feelings in it, and I wasn't wanting him to overlook my feelings and act like I didn't feel the way I felt, so I stressed my point in different ways, and then I found myself in a debate now and then, when I withdrew and said, no look babe that's how I feel about it I'm not asking you to make me feel different I'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings, When I came to my own conclusion, I felt triumphant because, the point of argument in my mind was to clarify how I didn't feel for him to force his you know he's very a macho somehow male guy I didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic, and so I said no as long as I felt better because I felt undestooded and I felt heard, Let's see., I can come to my son's mind that he's twenty-two years old., And he's got a very alienated relationship right now and it's okay, I'm okay with it., He used to be a little more needy, so he thought I'd always look for xxx or call him., unlike waiting for him to call me, and I think, It may be a very strange answer, but I wish I was his mother early in my life, which I would have somehow adapted so that he wouldn't wait so comfortably for me to be the one who comes, And look for him, he doesn't live with me, he has his own place., But waiting for me to be the one looking for him, and you know you're trying to make sure he's okay, I think that's probably much more ethereal than you meant, but, I would have done it differently, I would have mothered him differently on the way and released him at an earlier age, which means that I would have treated him more from an adult., And then he doesn't expect him to just somehow know you,, I would have killed the expectation in him that I would contour him if that made sense., woo < laughter> no it's not easy, you have to sacrifice and about just physical things you just need to make sure that your child's needs are in front of your own and, I guess the second part of this answer is that it's easy once you realize that as long as they're okay, you're okay, so, My son, my daughter, they both know that I love them unconditionally., so, my upbringing has become easier the more I have lived in this truth, where I expect nothing from them, but then expect no disrespect., as long as we have this clear line of communication, whatever still happens, falls under this category of respect, see them, maybe make decisions I wish they wouldn't uh it could be as easy as an outfit <Laughter> You know, choice or as much as a career change, But I have to sit back and watch them listen, be open and then just, somehow just be there you know if they want to talk about it, but then also try not to manage it because I was also her age and I must remember that, I didn't want to be managed and even if I made a mistake, I didn't want to be judged, so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on my own, and just kind of just waiting around and luckily it's nothing important with my kids, but, Whatever this personal downfall is just kind of being there and not one I told you I told you so about ghost on me, It fills the knowledge that you know I created the one you know I planned my two kids, so it's just a real one., It's an honor that I could do it, it's an honor that they're healthy., And it's fun to see them grow up to their own., and it's like they're mini me's, but then they're different than I am and so it's just fun, be able to allow them who they are and just celebrate as they are, so I enjoy the, wow completely my parents immigrated here from Central America in the sixties around I was born in the year after they arrived here, so their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the American lifestyle anyway which wasn't a bad thing, It's just that their upbringing style was more about making sure we have a home to make sure, uh we had the accommodation of course and food and clothing and schooling, but there wasn't really much time for my mother's relationship with my daughter as a daughter or my father's relationship with me as a daughter, So I had to figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent., I wanted to divorce my first husband because I would be the one who overthrew the whole situation... he was a good father, just not a good husband for me., And after twenty years, I knew that I was going to be the one who said it wasn't working for me anymore., and, Since I did that the domino effect was <ha>, it wasn't virtual, it happened <laughter> We sold our house, you know, split up the assets and then live apart and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while, And then I made some decisions where I didn't want to go through so much trouble, so I just..., has a tina Turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else, so it was just a very hard decision by, how it affected my children, that's all I care about losing everything, physical and and and all the material that might be less important to me, But it was hard because I knew it would affect my children, and they were the only thing that worried me., Uh my husband and I didn't know you saw eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he I didn't feel validated as a woman or as a woman and that's just who I am and those were the areas that, He didn't confirm me because he somehow saw me as a partner who financed his extracurriculars, whether it was just traveling or whatever the case, I'm not here to talk about it., Whatever he did was outside of you that you know the sanctity of our house., and I was tired of just you know work and and and he benefits from everything, but then not fulfilled as a woman or a woman and he wasn't ready to change xxx despite all the advice we went through, and I thought well that this didn't work for me and I had to take care of myself first and I had low self-esteem i you know I wasn't perfect I had a lot of things going on with myself and I had to learn how to love me, to love my children and then to get the love I should get in return., < slaughter>, You know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day I just know you're good bad ugly or no matter what mistake I made that day or whatever great thing went on that day, my goal in life is to just rest, so when I have my head in the night, I'm just wondering if you knew I did something that I was ashamed of, that I ran over someone today., have I not known, and I am not holy or acting as if I am Pollyanna, but I believe in karma, I'm a God-fearing woman, so I just want to make sure I've done everything I should do today., And if there's something I can correct, you know, I'll just do it one point to promise me,, go back and correct it or at least learn from it and just don't make the same mistake on another day, really good light, you know, had some rough spots with the family individually as I said with my son, My daughter is a teenager, so somehow she comes into her own, so that's another relationship she's against me, I'm actually very looser, very Bohemian style, she's very social you know, just out there, so somehow I need to find our balance, but overall it's just I won't complain I'm very happy for a very simple lifestyle, that I'm just kind of on my own care every day and I just enjoy my little, Mini services, whether someone sees them or not, < slaughter>, No, I didn't thank God., no, really happy let's see, It's at home and I think it was when, Wow, <mumble> different things that run around my mind, I think when my daughter and I got my teenage daughter and I got to understand <underst> anyway understanding on, Our mother-daughter relationship I'm not trying to be her best friend, but that doesn't mean she can't talk to me., and I think when she came to me the other day and gave me a big hug from behind me, without really saying something that I really felt, how she accepted herself, and she accepted the fact that I accept who she is, how she is, so it was a very, Only she and I knew about it, but there was only one luck that nothing else could ever give me., < slaughter>, Thank you., I'm reckless, I'm just very funny., You know, to any chameleon comes to mind, I just kind of acquislimate what kind of situation I'm in I'm very honest I'm very real and only you know, brave when I have to be, I'm just very grown up I'm a grown woman and you know they'd just describe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that they're on extremely reliable I do as I say what I do, And all I know is that I don't know., I don't care about b s < laughter>, What could I change about myself?, Uh probably cosmetic things maybe I would just uh that's not even true let me think what are some things that I would change about myself, Uh, sounds weird that I wouldn't say much about anything really, I think I'd be easy, a little more conscious of others I think I'm one I'm super sensitive to others, but I think I'd just be more conscious, Make sure I'm not selfish or I'm not tuning someone out just because I want to get through my yoga or I want to do something else, I think I'd just be more attentive and aware of those around me to make sure I don't insult someone, I have no regret that I think all the time and you know it's natural to go back and say if I have in this situation with the mindset I now what I would do, but the reality is that I know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me, So I don't know, take advantage of it very well and then turn around and call it a regret, Because I know I've learned from it, it probably sounds very textbook, but that's true, it's just how I live, so I think that, everything that happened well bad ugly or indifferent, for a reason I really believe that and my job is to take away from it, what I should take from him and take that into my future, so I'm going to take that you know, the hard knocks with the joys, hmm, Be really with myself, this is one thing that took me twenty years to get somehow just to be kind of honest with me to hug who I am, to learn who I am uh learn my own infrastructure, Be content with the innate things that are part of me., Do not try <re> to revamp, Don't try to renovate me or try to become something I'm not, Uh I would still have chosen the same marketing career to still I would still have climbed the same company leaders, But I would have done it from an inner place, not that I would have lost myself in it., but if in relation to my family life I would simply have been more faithful to myself and so I would have had no kind of resentment, my family my uh my role as wife my role as mother I think that ultimately that's where my most important fulfillment comes from, because no matter what, At the end of this life, this life is this body in this leased vehicle., that I'm in around everything I'm going to do or all I'm going to be is an epitaph <Laughter> somewhere in a cement chamber, Scrubbed_entry, and I'm always just, true to that I mean, I was always faithful to that from the time I was eighteen and realized, I wanted to be married and have a family and children and all that, I think that ultimately that's where my true fulfillment comes from, < slaughter>, Cool, Thank you., See you.",2

problem is solved there, it was not a big problem, or I worked through it or the therapist by the therapist allowed me to consider another way of looking at the situation, and in this way I find to be therapy, really priceless, I think so., Yes, I was., I think it was, I think I was told by a psychiatrist that I was what I had., and this was within the last, Five years I think it was, look back

the drama club., and I've always had an interest and I've always had an interest, a great personality and, Good <Laughter>, I don't know if I have a dream job anymore., I'm sixty and, I don't know if I, continue to strive to do something, at the moment I would just rather not work <Laughter> and just, um, relax and travel, but..., I like being creative, in some way I can like independence, And I

me to the ramp that went back to the highway, about four miles out of the way and I just, I got very angry about, 30 seconds and then I had to, Calm down and say okay, so we'll be late, you know I had to talk myself out., So it wasn't really a fight with someone, but..., I felt somehow, bad that I overreacted, um, You mean in my life <Laughter>, many, Yes, um, God, there are so many <Laughter>, I just wish someone would tell me that I'm disappointing., Information, For example:, they won't use me for a job or anything, that I, to take a position which:, um, I'm gonna find something better, it's okay and, go on instead of feeling what's wrong with me, and, You know I did something wrong and then I get angry with her and, You know that, Whole uh, Thinking process that really doesn't help

<Laughter> difficult to make as you know what, to buy TV or something <Laughter> but to, um, I guess <gue> I think the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences, and, um, or to leave my comfort, Area <z> Place, when the decision meant that I had to leave my comfort place, that would be a very difficult decision for me, and probably leave a relationship, very hard, because, You know I'm dependent on this relationship., so that I usually, Live it from til, It's for you, you know, it's, they go or something you know it's very hard for me, to make this decision that this is not right and I have to move on, So what I usually do is I don't make the decision, And in the end I suffer, but longer, so, mhm, we can continue, um, All right., It's hard., Because I don't know if it's because I'm in pain., in my back, and neck, but, It's difficult for me,, Stay asleep, I would, I don't get it., a deep sleep, um, but, for, Well, I'm so okay it's hard to say because right now

don't really know what Hochs are, So I don't., I can't really go back and regret you know I wish certain things didn't happen, whatever, but really what matters is today and now and how you deal with today, and I wish that well I can not wish that I know that I will have less of these, moments in which I, Just burst out, you know that anger or something, I just wish that would happen more less, that the anger parts would happen less, And they are so, I guess it's going to be <Laughter>, less, um, Don't give up hope of living at the moment, and, Everything will work, everything will work, and if you think that, then you really have nothing to fear, um, the fact that now, and for the last twenty years twenty several years I have, I cultivate myself and I'm too <be>, more than, Compassionate

knowing., Facade and farce itself anyway, but I think there are ways, I have always reached children anyway and they have always felt where I came from and so, I think you know there are ways to talk to the system without even using the system, I guess I'm just a combination of the two I don't think, um, I don't really know, I'm kind of I could even work out there could overcompensate some debauchery for what's actually shyness and vice versa, so you don't know,, <Laughter> yeah, Yeah, that's good., Yeah, that's cool., um, I'm definitely..., uh try to reflect and stay in a fairly clear space as often as possible, a lot lying right now I'm in transition so there's only a lot and I and I hang out with my dogs a lot, So this is, quite reassuring I'm not trying to do I'm not really doing something that's also, tense, unless it's time for it like time to drive at a job or time, You know, go some things happen meetings and stuff, but otherwise, I try to stay in a rather relaxed room most of the time, so it's not like break and, But you know it, and I do., I miss <mi> I miss swimming I can't believe summer is coming, so I'm going to swim a few more, If I'm really outraged, it comes out and then it's me who's a kind of, Bad parts right now because it's a very hard time I'm fighting for my child, so..., There are times when I'm just gonna blow up a storm just to get off some steam, a little bit, but usually there's always..., You know someone, in the periphery that it gets and you know it's like this bumper sticker, if you're not outraged you don't watch out so, As a rule, some kind of reason can prevail., Oh well I mean, these are times when I just can't find Somthing in the car and but when I'm arguing with people, it was a lot of times when I'm flat out, You know to sabotage or definitely just, if uh what is the last certain time good i, You know that I've lost my temper terribly with, the woman who gave birth to me because in many cases she is intrinsic, I mean, she's pretty much a terrible person, so I recently lost my temper with her., I felt like..., I mean, I like it again, I think I said that just now I felt, in a way, Good, because, I see., You know what's contrary to not getting it, This is, even worse, but I guess there's another side of the bank, of, the thing to get to where, You can be a little more constructive about it, it's like, You know, you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a terrible travesty, but then you have to figure out how to deal with the terrible travesty., but I mean, I didn't feel like I didn't feel like shame I really felt honest no shame I didn't feel I didn't feel, There are times when I feel that it was stupid to lose my temper just because, There are people trying to use this against you, that's all., but I never feel really bad for, being angry about what I'm angry about, When I was pregnant, I wish I had..., Like I said, I've been through it., such an awakening upon knowledge when I was, It's like an undercover., that my respect has become a big issue, and, When I was pregnant, I ended up being so disrespectful in the place because I was a hippie on the beach for six years, so I always felt like I was being so disrespectful in the place where, To I was ready to be when the child came that I, stormed out, about what was a good survival mode before, but, let me jump out of the frying pan into the fire and they had my child, so, Yeah, that's good., It sucks., Yeah, that's good., I don't want to erase anything from my memory, I may have consolidated everything and, Working together, I don't know., and integrated I don't want to erase anything from my memory, Well, I got it right or I got it wrong, < slaughter>, Yeah, I guess the hardest decision was whether or not., Characters around, Sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and I should have said no, just let us go straight to court because the, there's nothing wrong with me just, It may happen that:, Give a s_s_i check by bullshit with my mother and I would only have, did you know?, Courageous enough to just go in there and do that, and instead, I sniffed out and made her mediation, and they tricked me, Over-precautionary, It's, Horrible horrific bourgeois quality, Intrigue and sabotage is bad, It's okay., Someone I mean, There was..., You know there was something., some great people uh back from afar I didn't somehow, Really..., a really great ability to build relationships, and I'm working through that right right now and I think that's a lot of why I don't have my son, but, as I have grown and developed, I have seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so this is wonderful and, but otherwise you know a constant, You know, contact with someone who's really good for me, it's been hard for me,, come to this point, not so easy in these days at all, I'm so I don't, completely centered and then there were some, Um, actually, you know that., uh, People think it's funny to bother me or shake me as they pass by and so there was real harassment, and such things, um, I'm still pretty polyanna'd out I'm still forging ahead and trying to be as pleasant as possible, I'm tired and empty and a little frustrated because I know that., I was kind of, that somehow I'm a little bit, around my around energy and space is usurped <u> usurped and I can say, and I don't know how to get through that and past it, no, no, um, There's I'm basically I'm very very happy pretty much, Blissful person, but, In order to fight this battle for my son, I have a kind of trembling area that, it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my street in childhood before I realized that I was such a happy person, are thrown there again, so I go through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes, but, You know, during the day, I'm gonna think of something completely true and organic and I'm just gonna stare at something and wow that's beautiful and I'm gonna be reminded that I'm, Pretty close to my mind so, um, I'm trying to stay there twenty-four seven I'm pretty spiritual in this way, Um, um..., uh, Fun, I mean, if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me, it's gonna be pretty competitive out there., That you know that's me is gone from you., that I'm funny and that..., and the, I think that's bad that I'm funny and that I'm good and that I'm trustworthy, um, just uh I'm I'm not necessarily changing, but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with, And from the people who, to manage to:, to, Drain me, I told you, I'm sorry about..., to leave the place where I could have delivered my son even though I was, Um uh a kind of, Abuse, Piss off your mother <Laughter>, I'm sorry, you know it and you like a lot of the <th>, and and, Yes and to open your eyes, look what's going on, I am proud of my spirit and outlook and, My access to what's really going on in the world and, my for alertness, of which I am only

wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait., um, I'd say, The Smog, Yeah, the air could be cleaner., and, Yeah, that's good., um, that's pretty <pre> I mean, There are also good and bad people., but yes, for the most part it's all good, Yes, I was in Mexico and the temples., and Northern California so yes, Travel, like clean air that is good it is healthier for your body, Clean blood flow, who are for people, Culture, and stories and when you come back, share stories like your friends, Yeah, anytime., like now, or if:, Okay, like this one time I was little, we went to the temples., and it started to rain, So let's just start going through and like if we got to the top of a thing I didn't know before, the higher you go, the higher you go., the smaller the steps become, so, how people had it back then, Uh smaller feet, So what happened was, as I went higher towards the temple I had to walk sideways, so that my feet could measure up to the steps, but when you get up there, it's a nice view, I don't know what to do., General education, but, Mainly Art, Yes, I've taken a lot of art lessons, Uh, good., When I was a child, I crawled on walls with chalk, so I thought you know how it kind of stuck with me, I was just following it., so, Yeah, that's good., My dream job, would be paid for painting, Painting Art, Yeah, that's good., um, Yeah, that's good., Pretty simple, um, It's not so much that it's hard, it just needs passion, um, Persistence, and faith and will, You just really have to believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself, the more likely you are to be successful, mhm, I think I'm shy in some way, Time and Places, but I'm also going out when, how I have the energy, so, I have a feeling it's well balanced., as if I were shy when it, I guess..., Okay, to be shy, you know, and I'll go when, like the need to actually, to have fun or just to explore, It feels good like, if that makes sense, but yes, < slaughter>, Yeah, that's good., to relax, um, I don't know if I should say that, but I smoke weeds <Laughter>, so this helps, and, I like painting painting pretty much helps me relax, You know especially when I blue the color, because the color blue relaxes around me, and also green, when I use these two colors and take a picture, it calms me, Yeah, and you got a blue shirt, yeah., My temperament, to good my thoughts, my thoughts control my feelings, and my feelings, Yeah, that's pretty much like that, my temper, I'm trying to make sense, you know, how good it is to go crazy, or when I get angry, what will be the result, you know, so, Controlling my temperament is easy, through the formation of my thought, To <sigh>, The last time I had a fight with someone, was with my father, and it was because I wanted to eat, but he wanted me to buy wine, So right, when the food was ready, I was hungry to eat and he was like no, so that somehow frustrations me, and, the way I treated it was how good, I could just eat when I get back and I'll do him a favor., you know, And then, after you know that I could just eat in peace, so, Yeah, that's good., my family, It's pretty good., um, my mother my father have a good relationship still < s> still married, and my brothers and sisters, We help each other out, So that's good, it's just, Yeah, it's like a team., a situation I wish I could handle differently, hmm, That's a good question., I mean,, can I get a scenerio, All right., um, a situation I could deal with differently, Now see, that's the thing, how I feel like, If I'm quiet in any situation, I could find out., You know, but when it came to a Rubik cube, Maybe, How would I deal with the situation just by, Uh fail uh fail make mistakes, because I would make the right mistakes and follow the right lessons, so, This is the best way to answer your question., you know, Yeah, that's good., a positive influence, Pretty much., Anyone who told me the truth was a positive influence you know., For example:, Yes, even if it may hurt like oh the truth hurts, Well, they're not trying to be mean, they're actually, good influences, so I would say my friends, My mom, my dad., my brother my sisters, Yeah, that's good., mm, See, that's kind of like, You like me I've had some pretty bad experiences with as on shot tip and with a knife, But at the end of the day, what it did was to give me more insight, it made me more conscious, and, it taught me how to read people a little more like, easy to feel things and also how to avoid situations so, although it was bad and it kind of like, Scare me, It prepared me like, the world you know because that happened to me when I was twelve thirteen years old, so I was already exposed like, You know, like rifle knives and all that stuff., It's bad, but it's good in the long run., You know it because, when you get out of the burglary, It's like, Nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know it in your head like oh I've been through worse, so it's not so bad that you know, and, So yes., the toughest, um, Man, see this right now uh for a moment when I was stuck I was like trying to think that was that was part of it, but uh toughest decision as far as life changes, Lives, whether the school should continue, Higher education, or not, mm i somehow chosen, to like, I went to school, but I decided to pursue my own like, I learn more by connecting with people who are already in the field where I want to be., So that was a tough choice, because there is no, In order to guarantee that I, For example:, how to run the right people, But I took the risk, and you know I met the right people., Yeah, that's good., Yeah, that's good., Yeah, that's good., It's really very simple, Sometimes it's like I could sleep in ten minutes., I could turn my mind off like I'm just calming down., How slow down my air patterns, Yeah, that's good., mhm, lately, I felt, Good, I feel like I have free will., how at this point in time I feel like, when I have chosen a path, Of a kind used in the manufacture of motor vehicles, My heart, I could, You know you're here., But I'm kind of like, still decide it's like everything in all these paths in the air, I'm just trying to make my own, I don't know., that's where I'm at I feel like I have free will, So yes., lately as in the last two weeks or today, < slaughter>, All right., - Yeah, you know., um, Yeah, that's good., Things happen that would change like, my feelings and, For example, right now it just happened, What are you doing?, for now as, this experience for one is like a shift in my mind, because, Yeah, it's like, it's technology you know it's like a journey to see how far, For example:, you could think about it, and then do it, Reality, So that's kind of like moving my thoughts right now, this experience this whole experience, Yeah, that's good., Uh post-traumatic stress disorder, no, Depression I know what it's like to be depressed, but diagnosed by a doctor, Depression, How, how it feels, How does depression feel?, It feels like, It's like a bird in a cage, Being depression is like, a fish that cannot swim in the water, I feel like depression is like a bird without wings, um, Pretty much it feels, As if you were limited., But then the thing is, To get out of this depression, It's like you have to, Awaken and change your perspective, and focus on, as I would say colors help colors, and help people who talk to people, Yeah, that's good., be depressed, mm let's see, mm, I don't know., For example:, It could come as if it could happen every day, like in small doses., so, as I could say today you know earlier when I was just alone I felt a little depressed, but then what happened I fixed it like, called a friend and, met with him and yeah, I mean, at this moment, I feel pretty happy that you know., I'm talking to a virtual person, it's pretty cool, and, Yeah, that's good., Now I feel happy., < slaughter>, um, sometimes hard head, Like he's trying to teach me..., a certain lesson, whether it's art, or as in my character, and, Yeah, he'd probably just describe me like that., For example:, For example:, he would listen, but at the same time he will still do what he wants to do, Pretty much like, I don't know., Yeah, I mean, that's what he's telling me, but yeah overall good person, probably just exercise, around my diet food, my food intake, and yes, just movement, Pretty much it, my health, mm, I'd say when I was in middle school., or, Elementary, also a little high school, but what it would, Yes, what it would be, it would be either, um, good pretty much my art <Laughter>, like if I ever did something and I thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kind of like, Like garbage, And then I'd be like oh, Damn it., either I could accept it and be like yeah it somehow looks and then fix it, Or what I'd do back then would be like fucking you know, Just linger on that thought., and then just like, Stay a little while and I'll finally get out., Of course., Most of the time, it's people's words., and ideas, the, Yeah, that's good., Yeah, that's it., Regret, Yes, I have some things I regret, Like what?, All right., Sometimes I feel like I should have finished a whole university thing., but, I mean at the same time I feel like, if I really wanted to go, I had been going, So yes., That's some kind of regret in my head, Ten or twenty years ago would be to seek spiritually, Feeling comfortable, you know, learn how to choose your thoughts your thoughts I would teach myself, um, Choose the right people you surround yourself with because it definitely has a big influence in your environment, uh certain events that you would experience, and as far as your general happiness, Yeah, that's good., yeah among other things, but yeah, what I'm most proud of right now, is my painting, Yeah, that's good., I'm proud of it because, I feel like these pictures I'm releasing are things no one else could duplicate., You know, it's like it's some kind of thing and it's like where you know it., It has its own signature, so, So yeah, I'm pretty happy about it, Yes, thank you very much., All right, thank you., mhm, Goodbye., < slaughter>",0

Molly, a ridiculous amount of grass smoked, was left behind drunk, Someone wanted to give me some mescaline I didn't want, but it was like March., before I went on the other trip that was like the

draw, my dream job is not working a job and am I, This is the dream job of getting paid for me., Well, that's it., I'm pretty good., like two weeks ago I was at this after hours, one I was already like super drunk and two it was after hours, Three it was like after hours, Man I had some pens, These guys took away my pens < clears throat> Pens in my like Fanny Pack I had like a Fanny Pack, so I had pens in there because I'm doing art, he's how close dog you can't record this and I'm like, All right., I'll just leave her here and I'll get her when I get out and he was fine., I'm coming out and they're gone, Accidentally overturning a beer, And he gets mad at me, he's like you have to go now, and I'm like it's not my fault, that's your fault, but then, But then, while that happened, my homie was attacked by these three great old security guards, And then you know when I saw them attacking my friend when I really lost him., And I and he and I should rather let go of my friend now, he's like what you're going to do, and I'm like what you're going to do and then how he threw me to the ground, then I and no, he had his arm over me, I put my arm over him and threw him on the ground and then it was broken, But that was the last time, I got angry., it was cool it was fun, Life, you know, huh I made <gibberish>, Perhaps this situation could have been handled differently., It could have been handled differently if they had handled things differently, then I wouldn't have to react., It's not like I was angry that I was distracting from the reaction that I had to react like that., because like justice, like I couldn't, it was unjust, it was like, I'm not a mean person at all, but when I saw, one of my loved ones being attacked I had to come, and how you know how to react that, And they were the hot ones, You know what I mean, I was like yo ye niggas tripping like yo, chill out this is a tiny little white guy, You're a huge Mexican nigga, like you're falling back., You know what I mean, it was crazy., < slaughter>, Guilty, I don't know that when I'm hungry, I'm gonna steal shit from business., when I don't have money, I guess I'm not really guilty because I don't really know, yes I don't feel guilty about, Food should be free, know what I mean, But..., Yeah, I don't know., I lie I guess I lie <l> Everyone lies sometimes I lie sometimes, Perhaps a little bit as idle here and there exaggerations, Okay <ok>, nah nah never, the toughest, I guess..., I don't really know what the toughest decision was, but I get confronted with tough decisions, and that would be like, I have so many friends sometimes, I can't really hang out with everyone on a weekend, So it's like I have to make decisions, like I'm going through this sector of the city., I'm going to hang out with x y z niggas when I go over here x y z niggas so it's like, Hard, you know., These are tough decisions because I never let anyone down., so uh yeah stuff like the decision to hang between friends

blind old lady., that cooks really good, and it's tight I don't know, something I could erase from my memory, I wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory, 'Cause it's gonna be like, because how, the experiences you're going through make you who you are, I think weak people want to delete things or block things like, There's no way, I mean, there's shit that was tough., But I would never say I wouldn't want this to happen, Because you know you have to learn from experience that you know I want to make you better., All this shit is like a test you know., This bad experience is just a test you have to overcome, and be stronger and not like curls on and be like oh my God life is hard oh, You know that shit's for weak people., I don't believe in it., I have compassion for people who, who want to do something like that, but I still like it, I don't see logic in it, mm, I mean, I stay up pretty late doing all kinds of reckless ass shit so uh, but when I'm home, And it's pretty easy, I could just go to sleep, You know, when I get tired, I get tired, Yeah, that's good., lately I've been on this as I've been celebrating hell hard lately like oh my God for at least six days, how to

own my own business and I thought management was a, a good uh foundation to build and uh learn more about it so I decided to just go into management, see the different aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and to, and then economy is just, just for long-term investment I really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and investment funds and, start buying my portfolio up, so I thought economy would be a good way to make a long-term investment financially, so that's why I made my economy, Yeah, I'm really excited it was, one of the best choices of my life, Yeah, that's good., I consider myself more outgoing I am, I'm pretty friendly, I don't mind opening up to people and stuff., I like to be outside like walking, I like working at the gym, but..., I usually like to be outdoors I love nature and just be outside, I just feel good., of pretty good for most part I'm pretty gentle chill guy and when I get angry here and there, - I don't know., It only takes a few minutes and before I know it, I just blow about I tend not to hold on to things or stay, angry and resentment, just because, There is no need, life is too short for all this, um, I can't even remember when I was arguing with someone., I have no idea., Probably when my uh, my brother and my girlfriend came in a little, little argument, like two birthdays ago and it's kind of embarrassing since, I wish I'd taken care of it., Right then and there, instead of letting it just stretch out as long as it's been, it's just embarrassing for both parties, I wish I'd only communicated with both of them and, said to them, you know, set aside their differences and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution, But now it's just, Inconvenient, Yes, it does., the hardest decision I've ever had to make, Man who's tough, I don't think I've had too many., Hard decisions to really say the toughest decision I ever had to make to, Maybe, not to Colorado for my undergrad, Two three years ago, was a little hard just because I kind of think what if, But nothing else was really too hard in my life that, was really so hard of a decision, I don't feel guilty about anything., pretty good person I think and for the most part, I couldn't figure anything out., something I could wish I could erase from my memory., nothing to be really honest i, I love all my memories they are usually positive for most, I know it's kind of, Strange to say for someone, but I've lived a pretty good life and, I'm happy, Yeah, that's good., I'm usually quite independent, so when I see her here and there it is., we go through long times without contact maybe a few weeks sometimes even a month, But when I see her, it's, It's good that you know that I like to say hello and show them that I still love them and, It's not like I don't want me to contact her, they could always contact me, but..., it's good for most I think as a young adult, mm, the family of my girlfriend uh, They were very positive in my life, if it wasn't for them, I would go in another direction., Just because I didn't care so much about high school., really long-term thinking, and uh just to see her and, what their family does and, how they think differently, how with your higher education and how to go somewhere in life and what if you do these things, this is what it could lead to,, And they were very successful they own their own uh, accounting practice; and, see that influences me to reach higher ones in life, Yeah, that's good., it's pretty easy for most of me just close my eyes and, Wake up in the morning, I'm tired, sometimes I'm tired, could feel that I'm a little drained and uh, maybe a little groggy here and there, And that's it., feel pretty good for most of it a little bit, stressed just because the finals are uh next week, and uh I want to do really well and only you know, close this last semester and I graduate in two weeks, and, for the most part, that's the only thing I'm really nervous about, but for the most part, I'm really excited about, I'm going to be fired for a week after graduation maui I'm, see what the future holds, where we will live <l> Me and my girlfriend will live and, what other trips are planned for the summer I'm just happy to be finished with school for a while, Yeah, that's good., I have never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d, I have never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>, the last time I felt really happy was likely to see my girlfriend graduation a few days ago she uh just graduated from nursing school on Monday, and uh seeing her go over stage and all that just because we've been together for six years and they're going through, the care programme for five; and, It's just, Seeing all the ups and downs is really good to see that someone simply strives through and achieves what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of them., Yeah, that's good., Probably outgoing friendly, positive vibes

she had, but, she wasn't a really good friend because she, One day she started., only, um, to be very negative and just to talk about me as if we were enemies and everything and, It didn't really feel bad about me, but it just made me choose my friends very smart, yeah just friends with certain people who don't have positive things with themselves or just, not only when I notice things about people who should determine whether I want to be their friend or not, you know that maybe she, bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and I should notice that this is a red flag and I shouldn't be this one, Friends <Laughter>, Yeah, that's good., To stay in school, Stay positive and stay focused and surround me with good positive people, and only, stay on the right

about their actions or behavior, I would just close my mouth and internalize my feelings that I learned that, It's so wrong, And so, in the probably last fifteen to twenty years I have made it to a point to my vocalize, Dissatisfaction with someone's actions immediately and that, Uh takes care of the anger right away, Yeah, it depends on what you mean with trouble, uh I think, anyway all the way around as soon as you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end, It diffuses the problems rather than, prolonged or delayed the disturbance, I go back it would be not to pursue uh medicine

here., my home town not very often around most of my family moved away so I visit them, but I didn't really go back to oklahoma much, < sniffle>, Oklahoma is quite different around, Uh l_a is much more exciting, There is much more to, To do here and to, Uh the sea is obviously very nice so, um, You know that's a good question., I wanted to try something new and I always loved the beach and, I thought uh and I also like big cities, so I thought l_a could come a good place for me, very it's probably one of the best uh decisions I've ever made, < slaughter>, Pretty easy I think around anyway it seems kind of natural, it seemed like a good fit, I just really like it here., Oh, it's great, I've got some roommates and we're really getting out of here I live a few blocks from the beach, Every day I can walk on the beach or, You know, hanging out with friends, and it's just like being on vacation all the time, it's really nice., mm, I studied philosophy and political theory and government, and made a little English literature on the page, um it, I think it just happened., I went to liberal art school and got a kind of exposure to a lot of different, areas and, I simply followed what I liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that, um, not exactly I work for an educational nonprofit, so I work with graduates <grad> with graduates around in the social sciences and humanities, But I don't really use my philosophy background very often., <Laughter>um, You know that I actually studied to become a success coach, So, I work with students is a kind of nicer, Aspect of doing, but I would really like to work with others <o> with other people so not only students, but to help them achieve their goals and realize their dreams, I'd say it's pretty hard in the sense that, um, You know, it can be a challenge for people, actually, are motivated and do all the work that is required to, made to realize their dreams, but and it is also a challenge because there is a life in it, uh requires the collection of money so to find people who are willing to pay for it can also be difficult, I'm definitely on the shy side I'm an introvert so, I'm pretty good at a situation with people, but if you get me in a group with more than a few people, I'm very much an observer, so I tend to listen a lot and I'm not so engaged, And I think this is, something that goes it is noticed by others and it is perhaps a little strange for them especially if they are not introverted, So I would say, and it's also a challenge for me, I tend not to be the person who imagines himself in a room full of strangers., <Laughter> pretty good, I think, But I have a temperament so I can get upset from time to time., not really around it can be a challenge when I drive < laughter> but other than that no, hmm, hmm, I'm not sure., It would probably have been a discussion about politics., and it would probably have been a friendly argument, um, Probably with one of my liberal friends so, but I can't remember the appointed time, < slaughter>, < sniffle>, mm, I'm meditating, For the, do it almost every day, I also go to the beach I love the sea and I like the sounds and just out there is very peaceful, and I like to read and am alone with my thoughts, That's nice., mm, Let me think about it for a second., <Sigh>, hmm, <Laughter> I have a hard time coming with everything I mean, I'm sure there are many things around, simply nothing comes to mind <sniffle>, <Sigh>, hmm, Okay, I'm sorry <Laughter>, hmm, Well, that's not exactly an event, it's a dream and it's not special, go to traumatic dream as far as dreams, but, I have it sometimes., probably more often than I want so that I wouldn't be upset if it, Do you know if I didn't have it?, Um, and it's just a version of a dream I think a lot of people probably have, but..., I'm usually in school somewhere., at the end of the semester, I didn't go to class to do the exams, I'll fail., and, You know really unhappy about why not I, learn and attend class as I should, Um, that was actually no problem for me at school, but now I have this dream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating, and I'm not quite sure, Why I mean, I know why, but I don't know what it's about, because it's not like I'm consciously worried, at least about the failure things so, No, I don't think so., At least not that I'm aware of it., < sniffle>, I feel guilty, I have a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew., and they live on the east coast, And I love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and around, I lived there when he was younger., to spend a lot of time with them and, Since I was in California, and especially last year, I've spent a lot less time trying to, for example, I saw her for a week at Christmas and then I went back, in <i> at the beginning of May, so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time I had seen her, and that I felt bad because, we enjoy each other's company and he, You know, I really like being there, but then he gets angry when I go and he asks when I'm coming back., So this is..., That makes me bad sometimes, mm, um, Well, I have a brother, I'm very close to him, He's younger., and, He's four and a half years younger., He's married, I have a nephew., My two parents died., So it's just the two of us and we have a large, extended family, but we're not that close to most of them., um, on my father's side is a brother, Um, and he's married and has a couple of kids, so I have some cousins on this side, but then on my mother's side there's, <sigh> five <fi> four or five other children, most of them with several children of their own so I have a lot of cousins on this site, but they live throughout the country and around, So we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook around and there a few I talk to on the phone and visit from time to time, But you know we're not so close to our extended family, um, I would say well, I mean, I have a lot of friends that I think were positive influences, Scrubbed_entry, When I came to California, um, I started at a non-profit work and it was kind of a strange place, it was very different from what I was used to, it was a bit challenging and she also worked there so, We worked on a joint program over the summer and got to know each other and, We have just built up this really strong friendship and, She's kind of, I'd say, my best friend probably here and probably only in general, and now she's moved to Vegas, which is a bit tough for me., But we're going to Napa this weekend, so it should be good, but she was a very good woman, because when I came here and didn't really know anyone, she was very positive., And you know, since I'm an introverter, it's not that easy for me to make friends, it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know, I think she's kind of bringing me, so it's a lot of fun hanging out with her and that was nice, I'm a sleeper <Laughter> so it's pretty easy around, Sometimes I know you know., Depending on how long I'm awake < clears throat> I can get hurt < wou> a little upset and so sometimes I need to take a while to decompress, but, I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that's very helpful, Um, and I can sleep, uh, You know, I sleep generally in 90-minute cycles., so, You know, usually six or seven and a half hours, but I can easily sleep nine hours if I have the time and inclination, I don't usually wake up in the middle of the night., or at least if I don't remember, so, Well, I don't actually sleep very well when I travel, is one of the things I do for work, that I travel, a little bit, because I work for a company that's in the east, so I work from home, most of the time but then I travel, like a week in a month, And when I travel, I take the red eye, Um, and then I'm going to visit with many friends in the evening so I don't sleep that much it's not that I, Sleep, bad or bad it's just that I don't have so much time to sleep, and on the first day, after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay, but usually the second day is not very good, So I get much tireder uh and it's harder to concentrate, and, I don't know it feels like a fight., I'd say good., um, Summer is a little <l> is a busy time for the organization I work for, so I'm a little, I don't know if stress is the right word, but I know I'm a little worried., Everything is going well this summer, but in general I feel pretty good, I can't think of anything., There's one thing I'm fighting for with exercise as I like walking around a lot, and I wander with friends and, To I was really motivated to go for a few months, but then I went away to the east coast and when I came back, I was much less motivated, Because I didn't really train when I was there., and I had been out of habit, although it was only about ten days and so now I'm struggling to try to get back into the routine and it's not as good as I want, It's okay., Thank you., no, no, All right., Scrubbed_entry, He's having a lot of fun and, he really likes me and I really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and, We're going to make a book club now, so we're going to skype and, Maybe I get more time with him so but uh just being around him is fun, hmm, <Sigh>, She'd probably say I know how to have fun., But that I can be serious, and, that I know you care about others, uh, and that I'm loyal, and, I'm not sure what else, um, I think those are probably the most important things., < sniffle>, I wish I had more self-discipline, so, um, I wish you knew I could diet or eat healthier foods and not have a problem, Uh with sugar because I love to eat sugar, I wish I wouldn't postpone because I got much better about it, but I still do, and that can be a challenge, Um, and I wish I..., xxx, I don't know., uh, I think I wish I was in a relationship, so, Probably those things, mm, hmm, So at the last organization I worked with, I had a boss and she was, I don't feel like she's..., I don't think we were very compatible., I pressed my buttons or so I thought, and so on, One day she was really upset about something because a board member called her and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer., Um, and he was upset about something and, It was something to do with my department, so she called me to her office and let me know how unhappy she was, um, but it wasn't me being a manager for many years around and I, have very strong opinions about how you treat, Challenges with people <peo> with employees, and the way she treated the situation with me was really inappropriate, I thought., She wanted to scare me and make me feel., You know, incompetent or at least that's the way I thought about it., and, I knew it., I tried to be very calm and, said I'd take care of it, and I took care of it., after that our relationship was not the same anymore and I stayed left there in the end <st> uh, To go back to the old organization for which I hadn't worked so long after, because I just didn't really have much respect for her after she did this to me., or after we had this interaction so, < slaughter>, So I heard this advice the other day and or so, thing and that I thought was really profound and I wish I had, Read it then, This is, When you think about buying something instead of thinking, uh oh, Here's this beautiful coat that costs 100 bucks I'm going to buy., it uh don't think it's as cost a hundred dollars think it's as cost ten times that, Because that's effective what your money could do if you don't spend it on this coat, but it invests it, you know, intelligent, you'd have ten times as much money., You really should think about it in these terms and I think I was much more a consumer than a saver and so I wish that I could uh, Ten or twenty years ago, I was more aware of this, <sigh> probably, Scrubbed_entry, They asked me to be his sponsor and his guardian if anything happened to them., And that meant a lot to me because it made me feel that they trusted me and thought I was a good person who could take care of their child if something happened to them., so, <sigh> let's see, good uh in <i> it wasn't really recent but in February I liked to travel and a friend uh and I went to singapore, Uh and I have to fly first class, We used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get those around, Tickets and so uh that was really pleasant because, to pull the seats down you get to sleep the food is delicious, you get special attention and I was also not in singapure before, so that was kind of cool too, safe, Thank you., See you.",2

a marketing plan, um, uh, I don't know that it's hard to talk to someone who's not in marketing, it just requires, In order to gain knowledge of:, uh, You know how it is made and it takes several months to do such a thing., um, Well, I guess I'm a little shy originally, but, um, I'm getting more and more out, just because of work and stuff., um, I like to train uh i, I walk with my dogs, we go

if I should always stay on it just to wash to the car and so, uh, Well, I had a conflict with my brother, and so I had to decide to have an alienation from him and that makes the greatest sense and that was a bit difficult, Decision, but just because of his angry behavior, it wasn't that difficult, but..., It was a bit difficult because I loved him very much., um, I'm not near my family., um, but I don't really have one, I've got a, a Japanese friend uh oh I think the sensor came from I have a Japanese friend I'm uh very close to her is like my kind of my mom, and, Scrubbed_entry, uh, I

rather not talk about it., To be in the past, but it will be treated, um, Five years ago, Uh I was I was just very sad very depressed and so uh I was scared too, so I went to, to the doctor and around them helped me, and I have uh psychotherapy, yeah for the p_t_s_d though, um, I don't know, I guess uh, It's just..., just kind of supportive, because because of the problems I have with my family, it's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and, You know, it just gives me good feedback and helps me make good decisions, this kind of thing., I sometimes have nightmares about my family, Yes, thank you., oh uh i just try to get better sleep i xxx i xxx i xxx before I go to sleep i somehow, How to, meditate a little to be calm and then hope that this will help, I feel happy all the

pretty, I wouldn't really change much, I'm pretty happy with myself, I don't sound imaginable, but I'm pretty much, now happy with me, That would be about my parents who abuse them very much., I don't talk to them anymore, so <Laughter> about everyone you know, if you know them, you know that they..., You know that said <sai> did terrible things to me so, I'd rather not talk about it., Let's see., um, Well, I just started reading a book I like to read cookbooks and I just read a book called Um when French women cook and it's about, uh, a woman relationship with different women and friends in different parts of France and that and the kitchen and so I'm really enjoying that book, mhm, um, I usually know you to get the grocery that I enjoy I really like to do the grocery I go to a few places, and clean a little and around, oh just oh relax, oh, Yeah, I'd say..., to have better self-esteem, because I used to have very low self-esteem, which one knows of abuse and so, You know, I wish I was happier in the past and you know it took me a long time to be happy because, To you know no matter what I did no matter what I did no matter what I was I was never happy in the past I was I was always you know fighting with, being depressed, I didn't even know why, and now you know that I'm aware of it, because of whatever events it was, that it was from my parents this about a relationship and so, I mean, what the Council would be, not for a relationship that, is bad for you as sometimes alienation is the best choice in an abusive relationship, um, just the way I live my life the way I treat people I think you know about, I think your actions are very important and I try to treat people in a good way., And I guess you know I'm proud that you know about my work, like

because he's mentally handicapped., He has the mental capacity of a seven-year-old., Although he's five years older than me, So just because of this dynamic, it's hard to have a close relationship with him., but I'm pretty close to my parents my brother lives with my parents, um, I'd say my, my youth pastor in high school, he was a really positive influence in me, um, only he has a, he has a drive and a zeal for, for the persecution of the truth, um, and just..., study of the Bible, and, and because of its influence this kind of, To want to study the Bible, I think I've gotten better at it., there were, Times in which, You know I'm getting angry., and uh, You know it can only, somehow really reign over me only the frustration, and I'm the kind of person that needs me, Usually it takes some time until I get angry and some time to, to calm down again, But I did, I've learned..., Over time, the really angry, And keeping that anger within yourself doesn't do it., It doesn't., attack the other person or the thing that I'm angry at, just somehow attacks me, and so it's really not a it's not a good behavior to, to keep it that way, If things piss me off, I'll try, uh, how to talk to the other person tell you know that this situation makes me angry I try to talk through them somehow, and to resolve it and come to a resolution, To compromise even more than just, but try to really solve the root of the problem, To <sigh>, Well, a, a few weeks ago or maybe it was even a month ago, um, my wife and I were on a trip with her parents, and her parents had already left, We just drove down., orange land area for this trip, and, My wife wanted her to expect certain things to be done before the trip, or that certain things be packaged., and, but had not really, In my eyes, she hadn't made that clear, but in her eyes she had, And so, when I tried to meet these expectations, they, um, You know I didn't get her after what she wanted and she got angry and so from my perspective I did what she wanted, And somehow being attacked for it., so, Then I started yelling at her., and, And we know that we had this conflict, but then..., you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had somehow talked by, and we had found out what was the cause of this conflict, um, ask the moment during the conflict, uh, very you know only mm very angry you know that you can feel it, In the body, um, Part I, which I guess, the, Anger was probably the secondary answer, but my initial answer was that I felt that the feeling was attacked and that came out as anger, so, I'd think..., yeah so at first I felt attacked and then that led to anger, mm hmm hmm hmm, I guess it was..., decide to go, To go to our training last year, I felt that God had put my heart on me., that this was something I was supposed to pursue, My wife didn't feel that way, and, i, I just felt very strong that this was something we should pursue, and, but at the same time I knew that if my wife did not support it it would somehow fall apart, so, I kind of gave it up <r> gave it up, Um, and I and I said to her, you know I'm not gonna force you..., You know, if you want to go, then we're going, but if not, then we're going to do something else, we're going to look at something else and we're not going., That was difficult for me because..., Do you remember that kind of felt like a loss because I felt deeply that I should do what I should do?, um, But then, after I kind of gave it up, then, um, then she came to a point where she said no I have a peace about doing this, and then we went ahead and persecuted it so, So it was kind of difficult for me to give it up, was <wa>, tell me about something bad or something I can erase from my memory, um, Oh let me see, I'm not sure., I don't know, I can't really, think of something very traumatic, I'd want to delete it, but I think, They know good things and positive things and bad things they all somehowa, shape who we are, and, So I can't think of anything I want to delete, Usually, It's not usually that bad., um, are you referring to the questionnaire where I said that I had problems < trou> some sleep disorders, um, the work that I work the, the, The way the planning has shifted, so that i, So lately I've been working some night shifts, or cemetery layers, so, um, Come home in the morning, You know, when it's bright, it was hard for me to sleep., But it was mostly because I stayed up so late because of work., Uh, it's pretty simple., um, if I don't sleep, then I'm gonna get crooked, uh, I've been feeling good lately, No, not really., no, no, um, hmm, I don't know., I can't think of anything that, The way of the ordinary, but, um, yesterday, we took my wife and I, took our three < th> our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest, to stay with her grandmother, But we took her to the park and they played., and, Yes, so those are always happy times when we bring the children to the park, um, I think he'd say I'm a, a family father, That..., I'm sure he can count on me., Usually my friend I'm doing at the end, um, various work around the house for him, Because I'm a craftsman., So this way I think he'd say I'm kind of reliable or someone he could go to to advice, um, I guess I'd..., I guess I'd like to be able to, um, Start conversations with people, Simpler, sometimes, I'm in trouble., I'm just talking to people., especially if they're in a group, if people are one on one, then it's usually easier for me to talk to them., but somehow talking to people in a group, I wish I was a little better at it, Now, if there is, All right., what I wanted to say before that was,, When I give a speech to a large group, I don't really have a problem with it, but if it's more interaction, it's kind of difficult., uh, Advice I would have given myself ten or twenty years ago, um, Probably it would have been to go to college immediately instead of going to school later in life., um, That's it., I thought that made the biggest difference., in my life I think, um, Well, I have four children and, I hope I raise them right I hope that, That..., You know the mistakes I made, I can somehow lead them, through their journey in life and I hope that they, at the end a little, better for them than, when I, um, Yeah, I just hope, Hope somehow through them, that I can, you know, leave <lea>

like you had to come with me., That was how I had to learn that in the past like two years, like two years ago, I just couldn't understand this concept, and to answer your question, I'm thinking about thinking, the hardest decision I had to make, is, I'd say:, likely, likely to break with my ex probably, um, xxx <sigh> ooh, around <sigh> where do I start, <Sigh>, um, my ex was not a good person just in any form or form of the word, She did a few things I didn't feel quite comfortable with., only to the people around them and to me, and, i, < Deep breath>, <Laughter> You know, They say you should forgive people., to do for mistakes or things, and I just think there are some things that people can't forgive., No matter how hard you try, and I think there are some things that are done once, that it can't be, andone they're just they're the way they're, and I think, I'm thinking about what she did., I just like xxx, eh, Things just fall apart after it's just us, mm despite us try, It just didn't work., I mean,, I don't know that I don't really want to talk about exactly what happened., Oh, God, what are you doing?, Oh, man., to delete from my memory or just to delete from ever

but, It's still, It's still there., and I think, I don't know, I mean, You can try and look you can try your best and find something positive, But nothing is the only thing., what you can do, is <i>, Just think it was like a freak accident and it's never gonna happen again, but <Laughter> I live in l_a and you know, <Laughter> Earthquake, <Laughter> they could happen <Laughter> and I just think, oh I'd rather, Do you rather know it's coming than not knowing it's coming?, Yes, <Laughter> yeah, <sigh> um, mm depression repeats several times, It's not a surprise., The first time I was diagnosed was in middle school., - That would be..., <sigh> ten a good twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years, I don't know xxx, I don't know when I was in sixth grade, that's, It's when the first time I was told I was depressed, um, as far as p_t_s_d goes, to go to Katrina, um, and then, you know, I'm just..., post katrina mostly < laughter> that was the big deal, um, I guess that had been previously diagnosed as being depressed and still in high school, It was kind of not that I wasn't really looking for help, it's kind of that I was kind of coming to my high school., And they were like here's help because we know you're gonna need it, Um, and I was like oh good, thanks for not really asking for it, but okay, I'll take it., um, you know, It just happened somehow., no not not anymore, um, eh, <Sigh>, <Laughter> that's a good question about <Laughter>, You know I really don't know., I guess it kind of stopped, just kind of was how good I'm not gonna do that anymore, sometimes, Sometimes it's the way you feel today., And so and so, you know, It's kind of good, I feel good right now, but, Ask me in two hours and who knows, you know, um, <Sigh>, I guess..., It has helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen, and just keep walking and moving with your life, um, mm essentially only, mm how to continue you know, Things will go on, <Sigh>, um, Wow

asshole and I'm not really an asshole I'm just, you know, I'm just having problems like everyone else., In particular, I have, Asperger is a kind of autism., That makes life simply fantastic, You'd also say I'm extravagant and eccentric, 'Cause it's totally me, I just..., I don't know., I think I'm still alive, so I should live because I'm still alive, And you know, Who knows how long I'll be alive, So I should know, live while I live and only, Go out and do things and not, do not sit and be calm, except when I read, and I like to read, <Sigh>, um, Stop fucking with me, no, it's kind of messed up., um, I think, I would have told myself then., um, Because I knew., my evil ex, I've known her since I was six and she was five., I think ten years ago, I would have grabbed my shoulders and said that you see this girl, whatever you do if you're not with the girl., Don't trust her that she can't be trusted., And more importantly:, don't, Don't leave your guard around her, because she'll exploit it., and I mean how physically don't leave your guard mentally, um, yeah don't date here just don't do it's not worth it < laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain, It's not worth it., The fact that I'm still alive, Maybe, Yeah, that's good., Uh I don't know cycling to comic con I was pretty proud of this pretty proud that I managed to do it, um, only, I don't know, I

the best for my personality I prefer l_a more space, a warmer climate warmer people, only one other, different Uh-Vibe, that I like better, after my husband and I ended relationship, I had family out here, so I thought it would be easier, to start here from the beginning, as some of the other places I had lived, or stay where we were at, extremely easy I came to visit here every year while I was in college so I was extremely used to it, plus I had also, taken out of school by six months and lived out here, and went to school out here, so I was totally used to it, Well, like I said, the weather is number one it's just uh, less crowded it is more free space it is a, a quieter friendly atmosphere, less hurry, The smog would be one., and when I drive the traffic, In certain areas it may be, but, um, in general, There's not much I don't like < l> it's, as I think, the general threat to the earthquake, but that's, is not really such a factor because it rarely happens, the price of real estate <Laughter> that's another one I don't necessarily like, I can't see your shoes I can't see your shoes at all, so, I don't travel as much as I used to., but I've travelled all over the world, new experiences, Well, I used to be an international flight attendant and then I traveled later, through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so, I have visited many different places and, I have to say it was them., all quite a lot of fun because you know there are different cultures to learn to see different things, Enjoying Experience, my experiences I would say in order, I visited Europe more than that I also visited, Uh in South South America I guess because the cultures are so very different, I would probably say rather shy around in general, in comparison to people I know are really very outgoing, but also, I let them describe me as starting, I like to read I like to walk or go electricity or walk, Listening to music you know, I'm very good at controlling my temperament, oh, Probably when I was, married to my husband many years ago, there could be many things I don't even know in specific, but just everything in general quite a lot could get into a debate slash argument with him, It could be a choice., uh, some of the cases if I could have been with him and I, you know it got emotional, or, let me bother him that he's such a big deal of something, instead of, um, You know you saw it., not reacting something, maybe, but it would always be, we were also urged to respond like this, You know you can't always say that you can ignore a person there, because it's often just about ignoring the situation and it doesn't escalate., but some people, You know you're not responding to the so-called norm., if you ignore it, They'll only know they're escalating, but that's not always the case., I taught middle school children and you can try to rest, to use methods with them, but that doesn't always work, but you always have to take care of how the teacher, You know your professional behavior so that you don't really, Even if they know that the children do something outrageous or potentially dangerous for themselves or other children., Well, that could be, several, mm, I guess it's a decision in..., together with my mother decide to let a relative have surgery, uh, that you know that the result was uncertain, it could go either way, and in this case she died so, you know, It's a pretty tough decision because you don't know, but you also know if it couldn't be very serious., Results also for them, mhm, Oh many different things that could happen, you know in life that you are always second guess, Things you might be able to do, but, They can also be learning experiences, so it is necessarily a good thing,, Delete them you know if, They can see it as positive, sometimes people can have a, strong reaction and they don't really stop by, uh Impact of the event, Because there could be something that, you can choose from that, But there I grew up in a house of, Dysfunction so there was, Just domestic abuse you know and..., There have been many cases, so you can't just say one thing because there are many traumatic things., But it would also have been a different outcome if one had learned to deal with some things., who appear as adults in life,, sometimes I see among acquaintances or friends who, had not really strong experiences, fall apart or just have very difficult times to deal with,, You can listen that you know that you and I, because I understand that not everyone has the same experience you know., Go through them, Levels of, understanding and you know,, how you know someone, They have a balance of background information on, which will help them undress and see that you know that things will, Progress in a better way know that this is not like, the end of the world or as terrible as it seems it could be, and you can also tell other experiences with them, of things that were worse, or, You know, seem to be, and of course there is always in general I mean, when you look at all the misfortunes of the world, You know that most of these things don't affect, we or the people we know here, , so that, ü perspective, which, You know that you're someone from her, I won't necessarily say self-absorption, but the apparently, Intensity of her experience at the moment, Now we have a good relationship with her, anyway in most cases there are different levels of, To stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced, so it has, made them interact with life and people you know more than others, some have not been having, so much, Experience in life that helps them to deal with things you know in a different way, so it keeps evolving, and i, go into positivity as a trace of, You know how I react to trying to testify., a more positive, Answer from them, instead of feed, sometimes the, very strong reactions or reactions or interactions that they may have, Excuse me., I didn't hear you repeat it., My mother different teachers friends, Well, my mother has always been a very calm, around person for the most part reckless, although she has

of things or study, or, You know., I'm trying to get more hours a day because I have to do things, then you know it's less, but, um, in general I have no problem sleeping, It's only if I let myself stay awake because there are more things I want to do, I have the feeling that okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it generally goes because I have several projects that I work on so, But generally good, For example:, I mean,, Not particularly, I mean, I just seem, um, less stressful as I get more things done I just get and the stress comes from sometimes there are a lot more things to do, in a shorter period, but, you know how to reorganize, some of the, Things That Need To Be Done, You know you can smooth this out., No, I didn't, but I know it's something that, a lot of uh say veterans in
