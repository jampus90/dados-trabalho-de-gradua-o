301,"thank you., mm k, i'm doing fine, thank you., i'm from los closeles, oh, great., i live in west los engels of the west, it's all right., i , no, i live alone., i love being from here, so i grew up here, it's natural., the weather for good the weather, it's always good, it's never bad, there's always something to do, it's rarely a boring moment, transport, traffic is terribly good likely traffic is terrible in almost every big city, but i hate traffic, not really i mean, i have enough things going on here, so when i travel, it's usually somewhere within the driving distance, i studied uh business, i did it., no, i've been done for a few years, so i haven't gone to school in a while., one day i'll go back to graduate school, but, my dream job would be to just work for me and make a lot of money., i don't know that i don't really have a dream job, just something i can do, i can work under my own conditions and be decently paid and be in a creative creative environment, um, i don't know, i think it's just a question of finding the right situation, so at the moment it was people are a little conservative, what they want, so and how they want it, so it's a little harder than it seems it should be, but i don't know, i think if the situation is right, i don't think it's too difficult, yes, no,, i work as an assistant to an administrative assistant through a time agency, it's just basically i'm being sent out to do uh, to do desk jobs, yeah and no, i mean, i feel like i could do more, but you know, it works like this., you know what i mean., i'm pretty close, i mean, they're so, oh, god, really crazy., stupid people just do anything to piss me off, um, that's basically <ba> that's the big thing to only irritate stupid people who just do things to provoke me for no reason, what is a good example?, just random people who find it funny just to sit there and get an ascent out of me, but it doesn't have to be one no specific, situation is just people who just think it's funny that i think they're just generally sadistic and they think it's just funny to just prod you as it is to poking a stick on an angry dog know that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so, oh, god, i told you., i don't remember i with these situations that i usually try not to remember <laughter> when it happens i just let it go and just like the past the past i tend not to look back, what do you mean?, all right., god, what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym, listening to music, i've got a lot of musician friends so i'm just so i'm usually around musician so, something i like, i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to everything that is art and creative in general., who was a positive <pos>, i think they're just friends in general who seem to do well and i think they're very inspiring and, that's sometimes a bit tough in a city like los angeles, where i think everyone's on their way to reach their own goals so they don't, sometimes it's hard to find someone who picks up or tries to be inspiring., i don't have anyone in particular, but people raised something here and there., you know exactly how hey instead of doing this, how to do about this or hey you're good at this, why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know, i'm always looking for new ways so they always point out things that maybe i could do differently, instead of just saying negative, hey don't do that that's not, that's why you're doing that it's a waste of time, i guess it depends on who you're talking to., i'm fine that maybe i could work on it., um, i don't know, i mean, i think i can do it better, well back to the point that people provoke me, so i mean, i'm not trying to blow steam and get them under my skin so i usually try not to get it to me, but i don't know, i guess with temperament i think it depends on how i handle my stress, lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation was a little better, no, um, nothing big, i mean, maybe when i was younger, i could have traveled more, or i could have worked towards something that paid better job, but i mean,, these are all things i think at every point in life that you always think i should have, but you know,, but then again i think that's for everyone, of course, i mean, i could be a banker or i could be a lawyer or a doctor and about ten times the money i'm making right now, but, but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine, so it wasn't meant like that, yeah, that's good., so, um, i think, i think my, in my life, i knew that, i have a lot of things i have <ha> there are more dislikes <laughter> than i like, so i kind of cramped it up to what i'm good and what am i not good in and what am i going to work well or who am i good at working and who am i not going to work well with, so i sort of sort out and then the list type of, mm of the kind of itself answers so, no, i don't think it was hard, but it was just, but i think it was a real reality check and i think it's kind of a good thing because sometimes trying to adapt to things that don't really fit you makes no sense, it's like trying to push a round pole into a square a square hole and it's like it just doesn't matter how you try to push it in, it won't go in, so sometimes it's just so good to go down a path that seems to work better for you., unforgettable experiences around hmm, i think it's just, i don't really like everyone in particular, i think every day is almost like an unforgettable experience, whether it's positive or negative, i think it's just everything if it's just the fact that, i have a job and i can take care of myself is almost like an unforgettable experience maybe for the average person it sounds stupid, but you know, i think just the fact that i'm able to, i am able to get as far in life without how completely self destruct is already an achievement, so i feel like, i've come somewhere., maybe not to get to the point of the average person they like to think how good, why aren't you a millionaire, but you know what not everyone can be a millionaire, yeah, that's good., um, when was the last time i felt really happy, um, i don't know that i'm not really someone who likes, i don't have really high or low lows, i mean, i haven't reached lows, so i mean,, i don't know that i'm usually pretty, i feel like a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like i'm reaching a thing then i'm pretty happy so, i guess to answer the question probably, mm probably yesterday i just feel like when i'm able to achieve something then, hey i'm happy, i don't know, i don't really have a best friend, but i mean well to answer the question in general friends, i think they'd say that i'm pretty much out, i'm pretty, determined, i'm trying to you know i'm trying to you know that i'm trying to interact as much as possible i'm always outside of networking as much as possible, so, i don't know, i guess that's basically what i think they'd describe me as, all right., no problem, all right., see you.",3
302,"i'm fine. how about you?, i'm out of los angeles california, what a part, all right., my whole family is friends here, a mix of people and much to do, early childhood education, no, not now, but i'd love to get back in., love working with children see them smile, um, guess it goes back up when i was a kid uh i like to be happy and playful, so i guess it just transferred to my adult life, working with children as a school teacher or in this capacity, yes, it is, but if it is a passion of yours, it will always be fun, i'm close., sometimes too close, i have four sisters and one brother on my mother's side and on my dad i have, six brothers and four sisters and we're all intertwined, so that's why i say we're too close sometimes, no, i have a lot of friends i can interact with and uh we always do different things, so i say i'm not, curse, < slaughter>, just let it out., a few days ago my nephew, did not call me back, a little crazy because i put some time aside to spend with him, and he just blew it away and didn't call me back., yeah, i know., i'm fine., when my mother died, it's about, five years to the day, so, it's getting better., time makes it easier, much, because there are many things that make me think of them every day., anything uh driving from a particular, restaurant that she likes to watch uh shows different t v, just everything that could trigger a memory, by my mother, yesterday, uh think about the good times and, i'm not staying in this place too long., come on, think about it and go on., mm not officially, but i think i could be depressed, all right., i mean, since my mother died, it's been pretty hard., and then, the work situation here in california is not stable, so that has a lot to do with it., yes, it is., such a kind of kind just for myself, reserved, mm not really, it's pretty simple, dimples irritable, zappelig, just a big nerve ball, what do you mean?, i guess, so yeah, i like to travel, meeting with new people, different places landscape, uh different ways to try something new at a new location, uh just came back from memphis three weeks ago, go and see family and friends uh it was pretty nice got a chance, see around, something new, change <cha> change of scenery, wow, keep to the plan and not, go straight to the left or right, um , only different circumstances in life, which, gradually pressed me to the left and right, every day, uh a few relationships don't stay in school, um, missing great opportunities with employers, to be funny, loyal, spontaneous, life of the party, grew up together in the same community, went to school together high school friends, my big sister michelle, o my friend troy, um, i mean, there are others, but these two, whether good or bad, they're always, in my corner for me, thank you., yesterday <yester> celebrated a birthday yesterday, oh, it was just a little intimate, recruitment, cooked a meal had family and friends about, heard music watched film spoke, about the old days when my mother was here and when we were all a union, so it was just a nice evening, thank you., see you.",4
303,"okay, how about you?, here in california, yeah, that's good., oh, well, it's big and wide, there's a lot to do.., in order to provide employment opportunities as other countries, so pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here, traffic around perhaps the violence rate bad news, although you know that you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still need to watch it so you know, look out what's going on a daily basis, sociology i have a two year degree in liberal art, but my main subject was sociology., no, i'm actually a m t a bus operator, now that subway is constantly growing around my dream job is to move into the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervision next week so 'because they're looking to promote within the company so that the good thing is there are a lot of possibilities in the metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition fees and things of this nature, thank you., well, it's not really hard as right now it's easy if you use it now because they look to promote within so that you know so that i'm already working there, that's a good thing, so it's good to go ahead and take the classes you need that you're interested in and go on and the ladder as soon as possible, what do you mean, i'm sorry?, all right., read a long walk hot bath meditating just close my eyes sometimes, i'm pretty good because see that i run a bus operator you in situations and situations you need to stay calm and still professional at the same time, well, i look at it as if it were going with me i mean it comes with experience you know about you doing something on a continuous basis usually you'll get some somewhere down in the line you know well so i see it so that i've been driving and dealing with the public for years so it's like you might know the people treat how you want to be treated, no, i'm pretty good at it now., maybe when i was younger, you know yourself when you get older, you get smarter, you learn different things, and i'm still learning today., i'd say my family you know, my kids you know, even though you know i've had a lot of deaths around me, but that's just part of the life experience you know, you were born here, but you have to go here one day, but, my children will hold me, you know, healthy and you know, i love them and my family, thank you., no <laughter>, to give good examples that you know because you're the first teacher you know and want to be a positive good example for your children, and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home, well, um.., if you're the first teacher your kids are you see them on a daily basis when they wake up, so whatever was taught in the apartment they're looking for 'and learn every day you know if there is a home school you know people children have a tendency to do things they see you know what i mean so that you try to keep it positive 'em good morals and values and how to deal with other people regardless of race and you know different things of this nature, i have a son four and a half years old i have a daughter seven years old and i also have a twenty three year old, yes, i'm ready to be, well, my daughter's pregnant with a boy, she's got three around little girls, so i have three grandchildren and one on my way this time, which is a boy., yes, thank you very much., the most difficult thing is , now at the moment, i'm a single parent, so it makes itself difficult, you know, and, they can be expensive in times you know it depends on the situation of the person you know whether they have help or a job you know things of this nature to help the situation better, but it's hard to you know, but you i try to you know you can keep a job food in the house you know just care and support my kids the best way i can, with my children or just time, what's unforgettable to me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree, so it's kind of like yeah, it's kind of, though i know the baby of ten kids you've got, and i've always kept this in mind, although everyone's pretty much got a decent job for my whole family, but i'm the only one with a degree, so i kind of knocked on my back, as you know., you know that i'm just what i remember graduating you and my family there and supporting me., thank you., i'm glad i've achieved something you know, even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma and i had, um, i was working on my bachelor's degree, but i ended up in a bad car accident, i never went back, i got distracted and you know that i was working at the same time, but i was just like more than i needed income than to teach at that time because i was a young parent you know because i had my daughter around seventeen, so i was like i needed the money to support her, but i never went back, but i did., i feel like i'm taking a few classes now that i'm on the subway to help me pull up the ladder, so i'm starting a class next week., thank you., hm, the advice i would have given myself, that i would probably not have been a young mother at a young age and that, i probably would have done it., stay in school you don't know that the accident only distracts me and not i would have stayed in school i probably didn't have children early you know about, i would probably have stayed at school and probably had a part time job or something just i feel like, education is an excellent thing for a person who only knows and learn different things keep your mind open for learning new ideas every day, so i think this is a plus that you know in one's shoes just to be better, that they know each other through education, maybe to promote in your company or whatever the case may be, that they help you improve your career, i'm not quite sure., you learn from your mistakes you know, but at the same time you don't keep doing the same things i feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change yourself, you know like me, even though i'm going to school late, but still i'll let you know that i want to make myself better., yes, my oldest daughter, we had a fight because, only, the life she is living and the things she is going through, and i had told her that she just had to make some changes to improve her situation, and we fought because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it., hear the stuff you say, even if it's true, or, or they just know that they just don't want to hear it, that they might be going through something they don't want to hear, but we were arguing about it, but.., that just happened, you know,, i just told her it wasn't me., i'm sorry., very close, very close it's just that the situation is my daughter in her just needs to make some changes to improve her life, and i'll say,, she's.., she's kind of stubborn in her way, as you know, that i was raised to listen to your mother, you know, your mother won't tell you anything wrong, and i've told her over the years that you know different things, and it's kind of like i've been talking to a wall because she's done the opposite., and now she's sorry that you know because she's like my mother told me that you know mom that i'm doing the opposite, so i guess she's gonna have to bump her head a few times to get it, it's kind of like i told you i left it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change., it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she doesn't hear me and i'm like it's gonna take forever to change, but it's up to the individual whenever they're ready, you know what i mean, if the person gets tired of something that makes them change it, it can't be if you want to do it, but, the ball is her yard you know., i can only do so much, oh wow, i've had my days around, since i'm two little ones around me kind of like trained them to go to bed at eight o'clock because you know they have to go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's sleep because it kind of like, it's like being ready for the next day, or you know how you feel when you rest, what kind of person you're going to be on the day you know, because everyone has their days, whether it's good or bad, but that's just a part of life, and i feel like when you've had a good night's sleep, i hope you'll have a good day you know, pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving the bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job yourself when very stressful, so i feel when i'm rested it will help me, what am i so tired of lazy, you know, feel like i want to lie down probably going to sleep <laughter> the rest i need, but <laughter>, i never thought of that., all i know is that you know., because like i said, you know everyone has their moments that i've never thought of., hm, no, no, i don't really have a best friend, but a person i've been dealing with and who i've been working with, she'd probably tell you that i've bypassed a go better a lot., reliable responsible, i'm a man to man person, i get along with others you know, i'm kind of like, um, i leave a good one a good sign, whether i know you or not, if you know how, like you and i now, you know that i.., you'd probably say, oh, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know, something like that, thank you., all right., i'm trying to stay happy i'd rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what i mean, especially when i go to pick her up from school or her being hey mom you know that just somehow make my day, only they run to me you know it and are happy and excited you know what i mean, thank you., you are more than welcome you have a good day, goodbye.",0
304,"i'm doing good., from los engeles california, around the cool weather the beaches the people the schools, development of children, yes, to be a teacher of special education, it's not hard because i love working with children., yes, dishonesty, perhaps, um, like when a guy like especially when it comes to relationships, when they lie to you about something that's very minimal, my mom i want to say my mom, to very close we talk every day, very close, although i don't live with them, i try to see them as much as i can, it's okay <laughter>, it's good., it's, yes, i do., they're friendly, it's just that they're very quiet., because i didn't get used to this environment., it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap, so that's good and they're friendly, so it's okay, i wish it would have been a little better, so yeah, yes <laughter>, i had another way to live with someone else., and i'm still friends with the woman and i come to find out that we're connecting more than the roommates i live with, so i'm sorry to move in with the roommates i have now, against whom i should have moved in the beginning, so, but i'm stuck for a year, so it's whatever it is, that's all right., how do i know who, i, yes <laughter>, there's nothing that really makes me angry that i can think of at the top of my head, um, um, maybe when it comes to schools, how they might treat the children especially colored, that makes me really angry, mm yes, because i do things from within i think so to do things internally motivated i guess yes, yeah, that's good., wow, i hardly argue with anyone <laughter>, yeah, that's good., oh my sister, i guess my sister who was about a month ago, uh i felt very cheated and insulted because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespectful to me in any way because i'm an adult, so yeah i didn't feel the situation at all, um, only that she interferes in the business of adult people and, it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she heard what was being said, and she felt like through my actions that i chose someone else about my family if that wasn't even the case, but because she didn't know the whole situation that she just automatically accepted and put stuff on facebook about me disrespectfully calling me by name and it was just so <laughter>, and she then comes to me about it as she did all these other things on facebook i don't, that's one thing i don't like is if you hate i have indirect comments like if you have to talk to me directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people, this is a pet peeve of mine, so i really don't like it., yeah, well, i mean, we're fine now., so that's good., yeah, that's good., not, people so easy to believe, so gullible, not so gullible, i guess i've heard that lately, as i think, someone is saying something that someone is saying without really thinking about it or without them proving it, so i think you could say i had a lot of mistakes i don't want to say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than i was getting older and going through the same situations so around, yes, i think people are too easy and i give people too many chances, so, yeah, that's good., when i went on a cruise that was a happy experience when i went on a cruise with my family to mexico when i was sixteen, about six years ago, yes <laughter>, yes, i mean yes, i guess it was <laughter>, no, i really want it., um, try to see new things new views of the world around trying to see the different types of food around how the government is and how they run things out there i think, um, yeah, i'm planning to go to the bahamas next year., i plan to actually do a lot of travel next year, so, yeah, that's good., it's pretty good., oh, kind of., i'm tired <laughter> and i fall asleep in class and what's not, yeah, that's good., it's my fault., ahem probably today, yeah, that's good., well, i fell asleep late, so it's my fault., no, i feel pretty happy now., mhm, no, very friendly and funny, talkative, to get through high school, we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week i'll try to see them at least every few months, they are everywhere <laughter> around yeah, no comment on this, they're smarter, they learn more than we learned in the day they learn, they're very advanced, but when it comes to technology, they're not out, they're always on the computer on their phones, they don't play outside anymore, they don't care about nature or the little things in life, they just do, but when it comes to their mentality, they argue smarter, because the schools get better, i won't lie that way., when what happened, i was just.., all right., last weekend i guess, right now., um , what did i do?, being with my boyfriend makes me really happy, so i just hung out with him last weekend and i can never see him that much, yeah, because he works i have school different schedules, it's not that bad <laughter>, he's my friend i've known for six months., we met by a friend together, in l a i guess, all right., you're welcome., see you.",6
305,"i'm fine., i'm originally from california, uh born in glendale, i'm not so happy with that., just unemployed at the moment but uh, active in search of uh, uh do what i'm supposed to do uh there's some uh, some prospects there, but hopefully i'll learn something today, yeah, that's good., well, i have one, it's a girlfriend, so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing, excuse me., we're pretty close., uh i met her last year and uh, we've been through something., disturbing times, but we begin to see a light at the end of the tunnel, uh, the disturbing times, uh, i would, let me see uh, all right., i got a d u i last year and lost my job, i'm a truck driver by trade so, such a way, threw me far away uh with a fourteen hundred dollars a week job uh and then go to nothing like plus losing my license somehow threw me away really, and i couldn't get around, i didn't really uh, i found everything i was interested in, so i started cooking., and we try to see which other route i can go as far as uh a kind of career and uh, so, i decide to go to the culinary field, but, you know, i still have to work, it's hard to find work with uh without going to school., and uh so, but i think i applied to ralphs today, so i hope i get the job i should actually have, so.., um, but i'm starting to see a light, as i said at the end of the tunnel, now a little bit gradually, my dream job would probably be a forest service, out in the wilderness yeah, i like being alone, excuse me., all right., you know, i have a lot for animals i'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like it, i don't like people too much, uh so being out and uh i've always enjoyed being out, that's how i'm a truck driver i've traveled the world, i don't like being in a warehouse or an office., outdoor kind of guy so, one of my trips would be uh, i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the lower island uh there that they built this bridge, uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh, i was there to work., uh for a very white oh uh a very white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus, so it was interesting that many people on this island didn't really see many americans, because that was also one of the islands we bombed., so there was a lot of negativity, but i've got quite a good idea, you know, outlook uh on life uh especially during the times you know i, i enjoyed it that you know., through all the travel and meeting new people and to eat you know different around different foods and uh it was a good experience for me, all the experience was pretty good for me you know, just traveling around with circuses and uh, you know it was great., uh, likely, a few of the things i like about l a, there's not much i like about l a but, i like hollywood, i like the film industry., the uh huge uh, um, different people you know differently uh, different ethnicities of uh people here you know uh, i enjoy talking to some people who know many foreigners i like to see where they came from and what it looks like there., the traffic is horrible, you know, transport < slaughter>, uh ignorance uh, be disrespectful uh disrespectful or whatever you know other people disrespecting you or other people, um, that's it., dishonesty, excuse me., uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i drive the bus a lot so uh, you know, or i, when i ride my bike, uh, people tend to drive me almost over, so if i don't pay attention to the traffic all the time, uh you know i find myself sometimes, you know you have to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of having the right to go or something like that., yeah big time, what do i do if i'm angry?, um, i'm probably sitting there, sitting there, airing, you know, i speak my opinion, even if i'm often myself, you know exactly how you know assholes or whatever you are., now you know, i carry stones in my back pocket, so i can know it's happening so much where i'm just i'm just surprised about what people do sometimes you know that you almost know about everything you know, i'll probably almost run over probably on a daily basis, and if i don't watch, i'd be in the shit stream., it's hard to deal with people who are particularly trying not to respond because there are consequences for your reactions., it was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest., i'm pretty honest with, i am open and honest about everything and everything, and uh, what it was about uh just she lied to me to uh told me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something and that and this aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie, so i just, you know that didn't like it at all., excuse me., um, i'm trying to miss the word for it., just that i don't know now if i could believe everything she's saying now, so it was uh, i felt hurt you know, uh, you know that here we're in a relationship for a little and good, that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is being honest, um, i don't like that i said i'm not holding back and i'm pretty honest in everything and everything i do or say so, you know and if you lie about something good, you always have to cover up., more lies with the lies you've already told and i just, you don't see anyone you know, so somehow it took a lot of me to trust her now, or you know whatever i am, you know, it's true it's not you know, so it's somehow hurt our relationship, there's nothing i can do about it., uh fun i, how to go to the beach uh, i love shooting darts, but i haven't done it in a while i love to paint uh i get in watercolor painting, and i'm pretty gifted about it and around, uh i want to try some other media and uh let's see here i love fishing, i haven't been gone in a long time., and uh, i like driving a truck, you know, it's my job, you know, i was a really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities, but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like stars i'll see if i'm looking around, pick some of them., astronomy uh stars up there and around, i'm a pretty easy guy to go, so shoot pool around, sunshine only, which i like, uh most memorable experiences around, good or bad, uh, the most memorable experiences, probably., play with lions and tigers uh, to wrestle a baby elephant in a mud puddle, uh, i'm just enjoying myself., i know, not, i don't have much family as it is, uh, at least here in the states, i'm not from central america., but i'm not close to i've got uh, three brothers a sister, and i'm probably not really close to any of my siblings, i'm talking to a brother, uh, a little.., my other youngest brother you know he just i would rather not know that i'm talking to him, but it's you know, only i'm trying to keep it on a professional basis my sister i'm not talking to at all my other brother among me, i haven't spoken to him in years, so i'm just near my mother, uh, my niece., a few of my nephews and that's it., i've done everything i can to avoid it, um, to avoid them, uh yeah, i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask for them i know, i'm talking to my mother pretty bit of my brother a little bit, but i just don't mention these topics or when they're being raised i usually say that you know it's on them and i really don't want to deal with them so, it's been hard lately, it was probably hard for the last uh, goes to one year, you know that i.., depends on my thinking process at the time i said i was looking for work., so just.., wonder why you know i'm not gonna be called i just mean i have racing thoughts, so , or i'm getting depressed you know because i or i'm worried about things you know that really i don't control, so, i don't know., lately i just slept a little too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to sleeping only four to five hours per night, but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired, lately i've probably spent the last few months, um, tired <laughter>, i know., sometimes when i don't sleep well, i just stay with the same things that bothered me so you know that i'm more of a guy you know, i love working., um, and if i'm not, it's just a little too much time for me to spend in my own head, and so, you know., i there i either when i'm busy or i do what i know you're in what job i kind of know you get it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me, and uh, so i can remember that you're either working or thinking at home and then thinking about knowing that i don't have to worry., you know about money, you know, bills are paid and i can just focus on other things, either you know, do the things i like, or, maybe spend a little more time with my girlfriend or something like that, how do i do something?, how can i deal with them?, um, i just.., don't try to think about it, it's not about whether you can handle it or not., i just do it's uh, i'm more of a guy who just, you know, it may take a moment for, to the, saying that i'm done with something, but you know, it's when i don't have control over it, there's nothing i can really do, the only thing i can do is control what i do and that's actively looking for work to go active on uh interviews, i'm talking to others about work so i can somehow know that i'm going back to.., back to the basics you know that i just don't allow a lot of things to bother me, it bothers me but i'm not trying to keep it bothering me, when what got me in trouble, my mood swings i mean, um, yes money i mean you know my past i have a past so uh the kind of tends to uh, i don't know if i'm hired, so i have to deal with different employers who, uh say uh crime friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i'm trying to tell you i've been teaching on uh, on uh how to interview, how to uh, how to answer some of the questions you know, come pretty a little and uh, i'm kind of thinking about it, but i have to keep pretending that this isn't the one that, who i want to be more like this or you know, i've done, uh, i did it., i have done my time so to say, but i took the time you know the last time i took only a lot of time and, and try to uh work on, the problems that have bothered me so much, you know what's positive, i've been thinking about my g e d differences many classes around uh uh going to school, i didn't go to school., and uh, anything that would somehow change my old ways and uh and try to move on to more productive activities, excuse me., i still haven't heard you., the, the people are deceptive, can you repeat that once again, all right., i was diagnosed with bipolarism., um, it's hard if you don't know., i'm not medication, so i mean, i used to take medication, but, um.., again i try to live from life uh i try to live life according to the conditions of life and i just know,, i know that the medical institutions always want to label something and, and what i don't like about it is that they're just experimenting with pills, you know, i was probably on every imaginable pill there is and around, you know, some of them were too strong or some of them were not strong enough and, so i just try to deal with things uh, it's just my life skills you know i don't want i don't want to work with drugs i know certain drugs work for as three to four months six months and then they go well here i'll try you on this and or i'll try you on that and it's just an ongoing process and i'll probably go for about the last two years, for about three years, i said that you know what that is, and.., whether it's different than if i'd be on top drugs for it, i don't think so you know it's still the same stuff that i'm still getting the same problems and i'm still, uh get the same fear as if i was on medication for it or not so i just, and i'll deal with it you know, sometimes it's not good, you know that i get very irritated with people i don't like people, i don't like crowds, i don't know how disgusting people like huge empty rest, um, but i'm getting a person you know it's not that personality, but i think people can see me and just say that you're not messing with this guy or you know.., but still you know, i like driving public transport quite a bit and around, you know you have a lot of disgusting people on it, sometimes i have to get off the bus., that's how i deal with people because i know there are consequences if i didn't deal with them like that., so i just let it go., i'd rather take the time to leave the bus and wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad, had a problem before i quit, uh, i don't know if i knew i had a problem before i found out i knew other people., um, i have a lot of ups and downs, so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me that you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that around, many remarks were like oh, that's what's wrong, you know that was what was wrong with you, we want you to have found that years ago, i don't think the drugs really work, but what i do, i think, um, as you know, just getting older., type of uh, you know it works, you know it, i'm so in contact with life, excuse me., uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while, um, recently, and it helps a lot what you know just to erase my anger, uh my thoughts.., many people may not understand, but uh, a therapist is, i think the bigger thing is that i can just figure it out, whatever it is for me, whether it's uh., people you know uh, uh, other problems you know were whatever may be the case, i just think to talk about it and they are so good listeners and can somehow like, you know they're giving me the same advice you know i'm giving myself or whatever i'm giving to others., but it's always helpful to hear it from someone else who, will be a you know you know they're going to school for this, so you know, but it's good to have, yeah, that's good., well, i'm not going around like that anymore, i kind of miss that you know how i said uh, uh, i really miss it, but uh, it's just one of those things that you know i'm just acting so you know, uh after you know if i'll ever get a chance to go back to therapy i'll probably, to good monetary reasons and uh, you know, i don't have health insurance, there's a lot of things you want to know, but i can't tell you,, you know, money situation isn't so great right now so, how my friends describe me, um, they would probably describe me as uh, uh energetic uh outgoing person uh as soon as i get to know people, um, i laugh you know i laugh i laugh a lot, um, but.., they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh, uh, hidden person i don't reveal much you know,, and uh so, someone who had a positive influence in my life, someone who.., someone who had a positive influence in my life, uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i started with uh, with exotic animals he really was, you know, he was uh, uh german and um, they have not been taking place, i don't know what he saw in me, but, he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and.., showed a lot of trust in me and that in it also built trust in me, and uh, let me know that you know there's nothing i really can't achieve when i imagine it., you know, yeah, that's it., you're welcome., to <laughter>",7
306,"beautiful, uh colorado, mhm, career, career opportunities, uh unlawful, uh for training for the weather, for a friend, not often at all now, every few years, oh the weather uh the beach sunsets on the beach, uh the thought of uh career opportunities, um, an educated group of people demanding market, it's an adaptation uh to come here many people misjudge it a little it's a relaxed appearing city, but it's actually very much to know uh sensitive to you, uh success and commercialization and this kind of thing, so you have to keep the pace, this is a bit more difficult, i think if you make the adjustment first, and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market where you just have to work hard as you do it in others, oh, be a lawyer., mhm, oh just because you have the power you can use oh you know skills to be able to affect people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being an assistant in this area, oh uh a lot of it is no longer around just brothers and sisters from the state so not particularly close now, dishonesty, lack of sympathy, uh insensitivity you know, very good., when i'm something, regressively so laughter , mhm, oh wow uh, oh just a friend a friend who's just a, has a fabulous job is uh spend too much money he needs to save, uh by means of a work situation only one work connection, together friends mhm, ah close close now we spend time we got uh we go and have fun sometimes, uh walk walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach area is a kind of fun rodeo ride occasionally, and uh and watch movies, art galleries, oh uh my daughter, i only have one daughter who graduated from u c l a law school and uh i raised her all alone without any help, so it seemed like an achievement that was worth the two jobs and the work was, i think it's difficult, i think it's a difficult job that requires a lot more work than most people give him credit for if you want to do it right, you know, it's always second guess of your behavior and this kind of thing, i'd say group pressure., it can change everything a parent has tried to put in a child that is good, , so this was a really bad time for us, to i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you are in, or the uh, i think they are a little misguided i think a little uninspired unin uninspired at the moment, i think they're burdened by the worries of the wars and so on, and i think they can probably get a, uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as opposition to only more separate group than a family fam once they were i think, you know how uninspired at the moment, i worry sometimes because you know problems with work, but it's pretty easy., no, i don't feel like i'm not sleeping, i just know you know i'm gonna worry about something at work occasionally., oh, god, a few weeks ago., oh just uh you know, unfortunately we need to worry you know that i'm lucky, that's not easier it's just the collaboration between people uh it solves most of everything you know so you always want that around you, only stressed, yeah emphasizes more, mhm, to yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not how you feel or misjudge things that you might judge differently if you were better rested, uh not depression, um probably yeah i was that as a possibility i had an employment lawsuit a few years ago and uh actually sued it and won the settlement around something about whistleblower thing implications in implications of that and around and i was somehow bothered about it and so i found when i came out of it i couldn't immediately find work in my own area, so i had to go back to u c l a and a new uh professional direction and, i sometimes felt scared that it would happen again, you know, and you think that would never happen again, you know., to just that i noticed that i noticed that i felt very uh in my legal class, i had a section on labor law, and there was a very complicated file that i had done with a lot of work and study for my case, but once faced with it again in this class setting i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized that i was traumatized by having to go through that again to know that yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down, from what i understand and so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i had to get the paper back and wow you know no adrenaline just wow, there is a xx, back back, just uh just extreme uh you know, avoiding something to do, that should have been easy for me, and uh and think about it as thoroughly as i should have studied it or deport it uh the feeling of going through the paper, this kind of paper, even if there was only one class assignment again, you know, well, not lately, you know for sure when what happened about ten years ago, now it was decided in court about seven years ago., and yes, it was effective, you know, it was effective in the way you see most everything and in your trust and this kind of thing, i'm sorry i repeated the question., i feel peaceful, yes, i was peaceful that it is, but angry that it has ever happened., so it's hard, i'll probably never feel peaceful about this topic ever it always, the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through the yeah, i don't think i've tried anything to avoid it., i think that was also an aggravation for me because i'm a patient person, realistic and around and i tried everything to avoid confrontations in the matter, but it was only necessary to try, you know, help me cover the damage to my daughter's life, i don't now maybe once in my life not now you, if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you overcome the perceptions of people or their judgments of you if you can, effectively explain something and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself, that others usually have judgments about age or something like that, um, well just raise a daughter you know or uh, they know only to the experience of thinking that this was one after all the years that was a success was their graduation from the legal school, yeah, that's good., i'm just.., like a lot of work had a good end, uh you know happy that it fulfilled wishes or dreams for this child have been fulfilled, you know that and she was able to make this success, wow for laughter , i tend to be happy with life, because the alternative will do harm, that you know your ability is successful., so i'm trying to force luck i think in most situation in my life route i find something about it, uh, when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy, i travel a little locally i traveled more than i was younger i really enjoyed, but only too busy in recent years, only new places to take the ability to take care of the worries we have every day work, or worry and somehow see them away for a while and something new, you know the way, i go back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale and uh and spent the night there and around and it was only in spring when there were not many skiers and it was just nice and very quiet, many restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was nice, yeah, that's good., wow uh, only, i work hard loyally., to be creative, to just see something you're creating, you're trying to create, something you hoped the picture would know if that was the case., you know, just hard work uh just met or presented yourself in a certain way that you know that it makes you happy, to my daughter around very ver pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she sends me pictures all the time, all right., see you.",0
307,"< slaughter>, um, musk, my family moved to the u s and then i moved down here for college, uh it took me a long time to live here for about a year since i graduated, so there was a lot of ups and downs, but finally it was adapted so it took a while, though, it starts and i have two roommates and there's always a bit of drama here and there between, the girls but for the most part after a year and a few months i think we finally learned how to live together, but it was pretty like a reality t v show for a while, one from college and the other from craigslist., it varies depending on whether we're mad at each other so much, i guess pretty close, right now, we're a little distant., oh over the distance, okay, we haven't seen each other yet, we haven't met in two weeks., because one of them got into this car accident and so she's been distant since then and somehow locked up in her room, and the other one always works late, so we just got our schedule out and no one really tried to hang out with someone, so it's kind of, we're just waiting for someone to take the first step., it's okay, it's getting better., it depends on with whom, i'm, dealing with i think i'd say with some people i don't think with my family very good my friend it's not very good, but with other people i may not know so well, then i am able to control it a little more, but it becomes more passively aggressive than as full of anger, oh, 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch., yeah, that's good., uh probably my best friend nicole, she's probably been best friends for like, god since high school newcomer year is the high school when we first got to know so yeah, um, of, of what, my friend nicole, around we met in french grade beginner year of high school, we were in the same class and then we kind of started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we kind of started hanging out and then we just got closer and since then we've been really close, mhm, um, uh go out with friends go out in bars go dancing cycling hiking, stay active to go to the movies go to eat in restaurants uh photography, um, just hanging out with friends, i guess, whatever, uh, it varies as if i'm really close to them when it comes to things like school work., such types of, things, but when it comes to relationships and friendships and personal things, i'm not really talking to them., so i guess superficially close, but i rely very much on her, so we're close., mhm, that's a good question, i guess it depends on who it is again., i guess people who're ruthless are careless flakey ignorant, and, uh, imagined, yeah, i guess that kind of people, and when people just.., what makes me angry, that's a good question, i guess a lot of things drive me crazy laughter , but it's mostly how people react to different situations can make me angry, i think, yesterday, and it was my friend and we argued because he tried to be healthy and save training and money, and so and so, so by doing what he does, he's ordered pizza in so he doesn't save money and he's not healthy, and so i was frustrated with him because i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and every time he's like i'm going to do it, i'm going to do it so he constantly breaks promises that another thing makes me angry are people who don't follow through, about other people or about me or angry, xx laughter , um, angry i think i'm going with the no i don't feel angry often, get the fuck out of here., that's a tough way to just be paid to be me, i don't know what i'm trying to find out because i quit my full time job because i hated it, that it was usually sitting in an office all day, which i thought was extremely boring., so now i'm working in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself., my dream job, i don't know what it would be, but i know it would involve people and i would like to have a kind of finished product or some kind of performance towards the end, i guess it's something i've realized, i like to see it, the result from all my hard work because i loved in sociology and as much as i did that major is clear to you, it's a whole lot of theorization and argument, but without any real solution, so it's just like in the end all you have is these theoretical elements that you can't really do with and show nothing for your work, except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so, something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography, i love cooking baking in particular so i don't know anything, in this, rich i think, i've been traveling a lot my family is known for trips we've gone to, gosh seven eight different countries i have lived in three or four different countries, i haven't traveled much lately just because i don't tie any money and jobs somehow, but i'd like that, i guess my dream job would be a photographer who would be fantastic for national geographic,, to or a huge photographer who travels, that would be great, but anyway, yes, i travel a lot, in the new places new faces new experiences i become restless very easy, so it is nice to be constantly in motion and, see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just don't get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and worldliness of everyday life so it's beautiful,, stir up things, oh, god, it's all right., i'm trying to think, one of my travels, i think we can talk about it, i don't know it's funny, although i've been one of my most memorable trips in many different countries, one of the trips i made with my family, i was a three week road trip with my family, there are five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon., i know unnecessary to say it's as if you were so close for three weeks camping you always start on the nerves of others, but it was really fun and like when i traveled so many places, i realized that it was like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were around the southwest and the big canyon to zion to the great tetons to yellow stone and it was absolutely amazing to see that all the natural beauty so, um, and we saw a grizzly bear black bear many bison a wolf and it was really cool these kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really surprise me because these things are not man made, and as pretentious as it sounds after a while, europe is somehow not getting old, but it's as if you know that you have the same idea as, white old white men build large buildings and artwork and it's beautiful and everything, but as you just kind of like okay i want to see something that is natural and beautiful, or something that's different, cool, um, quite simple, as long as i, getting healthy no i always sleep so easy, oh grumpy and only very lethargic and little energy say not much and just somehow away in my own world, i don't usually get enough sleep anymore and i've trained more, so it's kind of, excite me, so it's not that bad., that's good., i guess i was more negative right now, but it has to do with such circumstances as uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job, nothing else has found that really found nothing else i'm interested in, so, it's more like ugh, what i'm doing there., yes, it's hard on the market and just like i'm very picky because i don't want to just sit in a little bit of my own cabin because i quit my job just for that reason, so why go back to another job just do the same thing i quit my other job for, so it's exactly how i have to pay for it that i quit my last job to get a better job, so it's kind of like i'm stuck in this section, just like living paycheck to pay, hardly does it and just wait for the right opportunity to come, but it's like, when i give up and sell my soul and go back to the company world of sitting in small cabins, i don't know, yeah, it's hard, but i mean, i think everyone goes through the same situation after college so, but i guess it's hard because many of my friends because i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a girlfriend who teaches english in afghanistan and i have another who has met the president you and one who teaches for america another girlfriend who is in the harvard uh school for how harvard master mass you know to get their masters, so it's kind of like ahh, all this comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so, i do it sometimes, but i'm gonna be hawaii next week, so right now i'm fine laughter , yes, but yeah normally it was kind of like down because, i'm just trying to find what, i should like you to know what i want to do next and how money situations that are very stressful especially if you have school loans to pay the insurance rent car loans as it is just food, as i can not even afford food, so it's just hard to live like this, especially after you've paid as much money as an amazing college education, so it's a little frustrating, but there are a lot of people in the same situation, it's all right., no, i don't think so, but i mean, i think everyone's going through depression here and there, so i don't know if you can, but don't diagnose how medically i'm not on medication, yes, yes, oh, let's see., uh try many different things and don't be afraid to fail, because i'm one of those people, if i'm not going to be the best in something, then i'm just not going to try to accept the best or do anything or go home., so, i think i would have told my high school self that go and try a lot of things, even if it means i'm not the best in it, so, ten years ago, well, that would have made me like twelve, i've done a lot of things i've always done., i think i would have continued to write as much as i was younger. i used to write miniatures like little stories. short stories for my parents., and i kind of stopped doing these things because it's like i'm not good at it, so i'm not gonna do it., and i think if i just keep doing these things and trying to get you to know different classes, i don't know, different sports i kind of grow up with football i don't just know, expand me rather than find something i'm good at and just stick with it, but never really try harder, kind of just like stay i always stayed on a level somehow, but as soon as i'm good, i just stay for good, i'm not trying to go beyond that., if that makes sense, now it's super lame, but i'm looking at t v., laughter , but i have always read one on my time off or just listen to music or just take a nap, or baking, but now it's like i'm standing on my feet all day interacting with people i just want to relax by sitting on the couch and lying and being like i'm done, so, laughter , that's a difficult question., probably the day i was admitted to pomona college., um, i was a newcomer to wellesley college, that's the women's college in the east, and i hated it of how the second of how the first week i knew only that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the whole year, and i just applied to a school to transfer pomona college like that to claremont, and, i didn't think i'd come in and i was because it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like the odds that this is ridiculous, i don't think i'm coming in, and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing, um, but then i got an email from one of the admission consultants i had met when i visited pomona and he was like hi tatiana like, um, i just wanted to see if you had any questions about pomona at the last minute., and i was like why would he email me the day we find out if we know you, accept you or not, except i have the assumption and so sure enough a few hours later i got the email that i was accepted in pomona and i was ecstatic that was like the best day of my life i was so happy, that's probably one., yeah, that's good., it was fantastic, then i took my mother and my little brother for dinner and i went and bought me a few new clothes went and exactly how went crazy colored my hair pierced my nose i was as if we started this whole thing around laughter , yeah, that's good., vulnerable, fun, maybe moody that you never know what you get sometimes.., likely, uh definitely friendly, and quite like a positive person, um, but sometimes maybe a little, aggressive, but, for the most part i think positive things i

312,"yes, how about you?, here, yes, the weather, weather mainly, yes the main weather, i'm sorry., not the people good some of the people things like that some people, okay, i'll cut you off., not as much as before, i was in school earlier and have traveled many places for conferences and such things, but i'm not in school now, but later i'll go back to school and i'll travel more, but no doubt, i don't know., i don't enjoy traveling, uh that's a good question that you're actually pretty good at i studied physics and aerospace technology, but physics mainly, yeah, i'm actually, just now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like this kind of thing and i'm going back to college hopefully that's why i'm sometimes nervous on the questionnaire, impressive, professor in a place like u s c or u c or l a or so, where the professors work three hours a week and the graduates do the rest, you're really pretty good at it., i have a lot of people., the first one i appreciate is my physics teacher in a p physics teacher in high school, although he led me to an engineer instead of a physics major. he was still a very good influence he told me., he's the first one to teach me this., school was not about a class, but about learning, all right., i'm pretty good i think, i'm single, so i don't turn into many arguments, but it's probably my brother over, he always likes to play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games, but they're actually pretty good, it's probably so and i get angry at him and him trying to defend himself, and i'm right that's all, pretty close to, i see her pretty, quite often i see parents a few times a week, they're getting older, so i helped with food things like that, and i see my brother, equal with him equal amount <amo> at the same time my sister i teach her children my nephews uh so i see her about once a week also, interesting, yes, because i spend a long time doing math and reading, and not to talk to anyone who is introverted, i guess i play video games or i learn, i learn, i think a lot, at least i'm trying to.., i roll my eyes, what i've been told is a bad thing., um, and that's it, i think., < deep breath>, poor education, basically parents are more self centered to themselves in contrast to previous generations and the children only, do what they want because the parents are not there for <fo> the parents are not parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion, <sigh>, um, i guess.., , um, , , thank you., i don't really have a best friend., introverted remembrance, i'm obviously biased., but they are, i'm really good at math, i'm not sure you can't say you can't get better than me, but the thing is, it's just that you achieve a certain confidence with it, where no matter what it is, you need to learn mathematics you can always find out it around i'm patient i think, and i'm disciplined where i can spend many hours i can spend many hours reading books that may not be important, but they might be important, so i have to do it anyway, this kind of thing, when i have a good workout, do good in video games little things like that, um, what is really happy when my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing, if it goes well, that must put me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood, thank you., right now., it is the fact that, research that i've made it this far, research wise, that's all, that's all., interesting to, when you start at school, you read about einstein and things like that it's that he's this general hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics, and, you still haven't realized that you're interested in it, but you're not sure if you're actually going to make it., and finally every step passes as a lot of time you want,, as time goes, you can get closer and closer finally make the goal finally you realize that you're just not as good as einstein, but you're up there you can add research in physics to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you don't see you doing yourself if you're a child, all right., um, a few weeks ago, when i got a good grade in a class, thank you., yes short, many years ago <ag> yes, i don't know that i always thought that i always thought that it was my dream when i was a child, that's why and i just walked so, around i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen, i was commissioned on twenty one and i was only for about a year, so i went on twenty twenty two, yes, not really, i don't think i thought it was just something that you grew up something about <abo> something that i already expected it to be, so it didn't change me that much, graduate school, in physics, no, yes, it depends on whether i really train hard the night before <bef> the day before, if training is pretty hard it's bad, but if i don't workout it i don't just know it's hard anyway, i guess moderate, thank you., yes, it's okay., i'm probably the way i am now., normal i don't think i'm so happy about everything, but still pretty okay i can still work, no, maybe something, i'm sorry., no, yes, yes i have changes in my mind, to get back to graduate school it was a while and something worried happy that it looks good, but worried that it might not be good and things like the, what do you mean, if i know this is a computer, but how hard it is to deal with these thoughts or how hard it is to go to school?, i understand, all right., i agree, no, not really., probably continue to do what you do, even if i don't believe it or not, twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yes yes it was fifteen, i think i was very happy and happy how it worked if it was a little different, i don't think it would have worked so well., although it's not perfect right now, i think i'm doing really well personally., thank you., also here, goodbye.",2

314,"yes, very good., feel good, los engeles california here, mhm, one of the few, about born born los angelinos, i don't know., homeschool my ten year old son and uh, i am a homemaker i have five children and married twenty two years, mhm, so this is a full time job?, we could go to israel about two months ago., for a pilgrimage with our church yeah so i'd say yes i've traveled a little bit, uh good last we went to israel as we did two months ago for a pilgrimage we were about nine days and, it was fabulous that we spent the first five days in chorazin., which is near the uh, galilet, and in a place called uh uh, i mean, the name of the area is chorazin, but, uh we were in a place called adonis galilea that's a um, a house for the welcomed, to christian uh, pilgrims and jewish pilgrims, i enjoy how really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting people and of course seeing the story i mean above all israel i mean, it's the, it's totally old, but.., most of the people i enjoy are the people i think to get a better understanding of how different cultures around, live, no, not at all, just don't., i've known all my life that i've always been, open and ready to socialize and, i always remember my younger brother, i say i'd talk to everyone and i'll talk to everyone., just because i enjoy learning about other people, um, most of the time, like at the end of the day after i cooked dinner and we have dinner together as a family, there is a word game on the computer that i like to play for a while and then, to see t v have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax, that's what we're doing, and you know,, because we have a lot of work to do, we don't stay up too late., i like to watch crime dramas, um, really crazy probably not much to, i'm frustrated with my daughter, for example, not cleaning up her room, almost always, that makes me angry, but.., in terms of how really to, always how hotly angry i mean differently than like, little things my children do to you, especially my oldest child, who is twenty one, you know he can be so confrontational., except that nothing really makes me angry, i haven't felt it yet., contribution to society help uh, help, to educate responsible people, i guess, and of course the love and the affection and the, the fun and excitement that goes with him from all stages that go, i mean, like right now, i'm in a phase where my kids, are either adults or teenagers i have only an eleven years old and the rest are all teenagers and adults, so it is really funny because we are able to talk about current events and, all kinds of things that are going on in the world and you know have uh, challenging discussions and such things, so it's a different level than taking care of babies and, you know diapers change and stuff., the most difficult thing is that it's twenty four seven., um, you're never a parent, you know it's and so you have to accept it, and that's what i remember when i first, with my first child to, think you know when i brought him home from the hospital, that's it, i mean, there's no going back you can't, i mean, you could if you did something terrible, but.., i mean, under normal circumstances, you can't change that, and it's a permanent thing, and, um, it's.., in a way it takes away your freedom, but in another way it gives you a different kind of freedom, mhm, always, i'm sorry., i didn't understand what you said., some of the things that made a positive impact in my life most important was my church, around and my faith, but also my husband, he was really a.., he's kind of very, how logical thinking and very you know grounded, so when i get emotional or get upset about something, he's always, we'll balance each other if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him., it was a great gift in my life., i don't think i'd be categorized as someone with a temperament., sometimes i get angry sometimes, but i don't like it, rarely have i experienced outbreaks around, i'm more likely to know to tell you what i don't feel to allow it to build, so you know how my husband and i don't, rarely fight like have, arguments that, screaming and screaming or something like that almost never happens, because like i said, i'm more like a kind of person who communicates right now, so when i think something, i usually communicate it immediately instead of having it built., i usually argue with my older son because he, um, you know he thinks he knows everything., he is twenty one years old, so he has the knowledge, it's all mentality, and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know everything and, if life continues, he will learn more., he is very self confident and very self confident uh, even uh what is the word itself insured and so he thinks that you know that everything he does is right, and, he still has a lot to learn, that's all, mhm, it's it can be mhm, i think.., that many of them are around, pampered and live in an environment of uh, immediate satisfaction, um, what i think will be, to affect the future of this country, but.., you know that with all the technology we have, there's really no way to go back, so.., i hope that.., they will be taking, i mean, i think this country was built on uh hard work and ethics, and uh, we hope our next generation and the, generations after, can hold that to, i don't know if that's possible., mm to, loving care for, funny, we laugh a lot and around, carefully honest, things that uh, i mean, my best i've got, well, actually, my best friend is, there's two people, there's two sisters i grew up with, and.., we, i, for several years, cared for her mother who had alzheimer's before my parents got sick, so i had a very close, have a very close relationship with them still do, and so around i'm considered the fourth sister, so i'd say these are my best friends and.., we love each other very much, it's a good relationship., no, no, yes, most of the, mostly, mm minor depression it was more anxiety, uh, probably.., it's probably been five or six years, i mean, i had when out and over my whole life, but it was never originally diagnosed, as as a teenager i think is when i first started with the fear, but, um, except that i know you, so, depression goes with fear when it's not under control, but now it's under control., i've got a great one, what are you doing?, no, i think it was what they call free flee floating free floating fear more of one of uh organic, for reasons in other words, there was a chemical imbalance, in my brain, i felt pretty good, actually the holidays were great to, we had a, good family celebrations, a little stressed out because to, we make a big decision to help my parents, my dad's really sick., and we offered to move in with them, they have a big home, but we would have to do a lot, some renovation and some, to help and some obviously move around, and so we are in the throws of it and around, so that's a big change, but i'm looking forward to it because, i don't want my parents to be alone because they're in the '80s., as they get closer to death, i want my family there with them, um, usually not easy, all my life i think i've always been, i mean, i'm not i've always had.., at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night, um, going to the toilet basically, and uh, other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean differently than that i sleep well, but sometimes when i wake up like really early in the morning, then i can't sleep again i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then, go back to bed and, back to sleep idepends, which is my schedule and when the children are, must be early in school and there are a lot of factors, yeah, sometimes it does., mm, i think i could complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know, but.., i think, overall, probably the same, my children know that i'm going to tell myself kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful, she'll try to cook my other daughter dinner or something so you know, you can put in a little more pitch, not really, no, not really, nothing significant, what are you doing?, uh, actually, yes, i do., i have the feeling that therapy is useful, we had a problem with my daughter., um, she also suffers from fear and, we've had them in therapy for some time and we're just about to end, a group with her that was six months long.., uh, group for d b t it's called and it's like a, it's the first time they've documented it with teenagers for the first time., and, it was really good it was, very helpful it is just around, how to live at the moment and how to actually know physically and mentally, strategies to keep your uh you from, your mind of getting mad you know, worrying about things or you know, in this case, some of the children have tried to get themselves or whatever so, um, this is the focus of therapy and it was really good my husband and i both go with our daughter, and it was really.., really informative and really helpful, i think, oh my daughter was around her, in a bad way she was you know, suffer a lot and, we knew it and.., that's all we've done., um, for example , really joyful and happy i would probably say, if , it would probably be in israel if we renewed our marriage vows in the in knaan, you know where the wedding of cana took place, which was really moving and beautiful., and it happened that our wedding day was, on our anniversary day we flew to israel, so it was right at the same time, it was beautiful., very meaningful, and unlike that, i would say you know how, uh other joyful occasions were you know like christmas and you know family meetings and, you know my father's birthday was 80 years old., on christmas eve, you know that something like that, um, that's an interesting question, i'd say, um, as soon as i'm done like things i have to do, like when i'm, have a lot of tasks ch a lot of work to do the house or, running errands as soon as i finish, i feel like a feeling of performance, you know exactly what i mean, i've worked as an administrative manager at u c l a for many years., you know when you finish a project or you get your whatever end of month stuff done or if there are a lot of different things, you have to keep to the deadlines, there's a feeling i've managed to make you know., so i think that would be that you know the most for me.., last, um, how to feel good and how to feel, how feeling reaches, dream job hm, i think i've already lived it, i'm also a birth doula, and, yes and um, so i've visited a lot of births and now i'm really just doing it for family and friends, and it's the most rewarding thing that you might ask to be involved in, the birth of the new life into this world so, i'd say that's probably, was my dream job and i didn't know, i've trained a lot after you know i've done my management stuff and.., was awesome it is and was awesome so i no longer work in a hospital, the hospital i worked in is now closed., but.., like i said, i do it for family members, um, i happened to be with a friend of mine., she uh she had the same o b as i had with all my kids, and, i came to bring food for her husband when she was at work, we were you know, close friends, and, she wanted me to stay, and she didn't want me to leave., i didn't plan it, so that was the first birth i had participated in outside of you., what is a completely different experience, so after that i was really interested in studying possibly un nurse midwife, but then i discovered this thing called a doula that really gives you, even much more hands on uh one on a contact with the patient what i like, so i trained to do this at a hospital in inglewood, about fifteen years ago, for my son is fifteen, and he was one year old he was not sixteen a year old., so, um.., yeah, that's good., and i was, um, now it can be difficult in terms of hours, it depends on how long the woman is at work, but, uh and you also know how, for me i always tell my friends and my family if they want me to be their doula, that i can't guarantee 100 i don't do it for business, and so and that's why i don't like doula's back, which, if i'm sick or not available, can fill someone else for me, but so far, all the women who asked me, i could be there for some reason, so.., um, the only one i missed was a friend of mine from church, and she wanted me to go with her second baby., i was with her at first, but the labors went so fast that she didn't even call me laughter , it was in the middle of the night like she was like, she wouldn't have two hours of work if she had called me, i wouldn't have been there in time laughter , so, um.., it was really fast, but unlike the, you know., yes, i was able to visit all the births of people who asked me to do, um, throughout your life or in your job, probably my own birth, i mean the birth of my own children, um, as if there were an extreme, feeling of joy excitement relief, because you are naturally out of the pain, and then it's like it's just a question from you., from there it goes on, but it is, it's like something you can't explain, it's just fantastic., after birth, and i have experienced both ways that i have made both., natural and, my last child was about c section, so i had both, both experiences, um, i had a kind of crazy nurse with my third child she was a little bit, psychotic, but otherwise we're laughing about it now, but when i was in labor, it wasn't funny, and around them, she wasn't there when the doctor i mean it was my third child, born very quickly after he broke the water and oof, my husband was there, but she wasn't the doctor yet and she got a lot of trouble, because after that i had only two contractions, my daughter was born in bed, so it was great for me because i didn't have to go through any of the contractions, but, i'm sure they weren't happy., then fill out a lot of paperwork, so, now i would give mysef for ten or twenty years, um, ten or twenty years ago, i was probably more, not like.., don't relax like.., how i now feel at my age that, i don't have the same worries i have then i don't worry about, i'm not worried at all about what people think about me, i'm not worried at all about what, you know, you know, like i said, my daughter, oh mom, you can't wear this because people are gonna say that, i'm just saying i don't care., you know, but they do, because it's still in their minds that this oh mama you have to dress like that and dress like that, whatever it is., so it would probably be the wisdom you reach with age,, you see how life is so many things that are more important in life than worrying about small things, what you are most proud of in your life, very proud of the, probably my family my husband and my, my children, i mean the fact that we stayed married, that we, we are a tactical family that, um, my children see every day how, their friends who come from divorced families or single parents and, for , they actually express, gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still know that we are still a family, so i'd say that's probably it, um, probably the, one of my best qualities is, uh, be able to listen to people and be able to, don't be judgmental., through the years i had a, a lot of experience with around, people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from the church and, it just taught me that.., everyone has weaknesses everyone has problems, and i don't think i'm better than anyone else, if you think you're better than someone else, it's usually a sign to me that you don't know yourself well enough., all right., all right., goodbye.",1
315,"all right., yes, okay and you, inglewood california, yes, no, it's okay., um, you mean my girlfriend and my daughter, yes, you're okay, it's okay, it's cool., yes, i do., well, i'm a football recruit, so i'm traveling., uh around the world to sign various football players for our sports management companies, uh, only the independence that it can be alone to be free and not bound to a thing you know it's great, i remember traveling to uh, , and bring him to clubs and that and that and we're not that kind of organization, <laughter> yeah, around dishonesty i <sigh> i don't like it when people are dishonest to really bother me and don't honestly not real around, that this upsets me very much, um, i tend to, just, try to free me from the situation to clean my mind normally walk or something or just walk in a room alone and just try to clean my head < he> my head, i agree sometimes, but i can definitely be better., oh, uh,, i argued a few days ago with my lady and it was about to, our daughter and some of the things she does at school and she wants to educate her in a way and i think, i want to raise her style from another way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so i think discipline is a great key and the key is life and she was raised a little differently, um, i don't just know, angry excited you know if you're in an argument that's what you feel so, they do and say things that, the, that bothers you and you just keep going., um, yeah, a little., i don't just know., i don't know how i feel, but i can't say how i feel., a little bit, a little, um, i don't know, just.., reality, um, honesty, the truth is just right outside the door, i'm pretty close., i'm pretty close to my family., oh, not only her subject, they've been raised differently., i think society becomes even wilder with the way children are raised and no discipline and the things they do, what we do, they live and everything is inflated so much where, um, it's up to a point where it gets out of hand i think kids these days are to some extent much wilder than i was and, and generations before me and just able to do and say and lack of respect and you just know, education wise it's just i think it's just hard times for kids and the way they act uh it's, it's ridiculous to me., um, i definitely like to see sport uh i like to play i like to travel i like to skate, um, i like, just like a guy who likes to see different sights and visit different places, how different <difft> i'm a big movie person, so i like to go into such theater stuff., um, i really live it., i always wanted to be in a kind of sports industry and that's what i'm doing now i just uh my goal was to get a little higher in the ladder and own my own sports management company around but i'm pretty good for me so, i'm happy, yeah, that's good., no, it's okay, i'd say it's pretty easy, irritated, tired, <sigh>, i don't know it's been a while., a few weeks ago, what did you say?, no, not really., i think he would describe me as a standing up guy i'm trying to be a good loyal friend and, and an adult i think he'd describe me like this, uh school went to school grew up together i know all my friends for pretty much my whole life, yeah, that's good., uh very close to me our uh my friends and i'm very close uh around us doing pretty much together still at this age, i'm honest, i'm loyal, very loyal., i'm a hard worker, i think i'm around, to some degree i'm just not the average guy i'm pretty much i'm another breed i'm just wearing and acting a little different than a normal guy, i don't know how i grew up and how my dad was somehow different uh and he didn't go with those in the crowd and i think i learned a lot from him and it's just it's about, type of, the same way i took, um, many things i regret, i regret, many choices in my life, uh, yeah, one.., i'm actually.., let a lady go in my life years ago that i thought was my soul mate and, we had a big fight and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that this break i started with someone else and i told her i'm going my way and she's going her way i think that this is a big deal., a bad decision a very bad decision, yeah totally i think i'd have a step back and really just about the situation a little more instead of uh, be so excited and move forward, i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get so clouded, uh mm i, i need to think a little more when i'm excited, i don't know, just, experience and time, when you know how to make up for your mistakes, and and.., be better over, different decisions after you have made the mistakes, to <sigh>, think a little harder about situations <situatio> uh about situations and things and the decisions <dec> decisions that you uh, think much longer and harder before you make it and i think the result would be a little different today, um, my grandmother was always one around a positive influence uh she's a big black woman uh with an old school, i think i added that she's a great woman in my life., , in baseball and around, yes <laughter>, i was a pretty good player, i was a pretty good athlete growing up to i was one of the top, , and uh that started a future in athletics and that's what i wanted to do so that i achieved my goals so at the time it was a great one big thing and it's still a big thing it's a great achievement in my life, to <sigh>, benefits able if i or if i am, have an objective or, or something i'm supposed to do this week or this day and i'm doing it always puts me in a good mood or getting my work done and i'm doing the way i'm supposed to do it in a timely manner that always puts me in a good mood, um, to be a positive role model for younger children who are in our sports academy program, i think, when i got older, the process of thinking and the way i look at life has totally changed and, i think i can find a lot of kids i can handle now and say that you know that this is someone who, this is a positive <po> a positive influence in my life, oh, uh,, a few days ago my football team around us are made in the playoffs the playoffs so that makes me always happy, thank you., thank you., see

325,"yes, um, i'm fine, it's a little weird that you're talking to a virtual person., around i was born i was born in l a i was raised in the suburbs around i have lived everywhere i have lived in the valley long beach and now i am in the culver city, um, there's good food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it's not getting cold i don't have to shovel snow, there are many ways a lot of variety all different types of people uh i think this is really great, this is a much longer list i like to get out of here, the traffic i think is number one, i think everyone hates traffic and everyone's so busy, all the time it's really hard to be with someone who's so interested in their job and, uh, we're also in traffic., i just graduated to have studied marine biology, i was i was going to school and i was originally studying graphic design and i found this kind of unfulfilled, so i made a trip for a while traveling around the world and started diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so i came into it, everyone asked me that lately since i graduated, i think i'd like to take a breath., um, i think maybe, management of research, you know, i'm not sure i'd like to., something in tropical marine ecology perhaps like a nature reserve to manage something like the, it is a difficult question to answer <laughter>, i know., um, i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world, now i traveled to central america for eight months, um and i visited a variety of different countries i, i went diving., i think i think intolerance injustice in the world these are probably the things that fire me the most, vent makes my friend that count <laughter>, i'm pretty good, it takes a lot to really get me to the point where i kind of blow my top the very few people who have seen me angry around, up to the point where i scream and scream angry, i don't know that i just don't get there, i think i'm a little afraid of losing my temper, so i keep it under control, it was yesterday when i was arguing with my friend about it,, getting a job, i talked about taking a job somewhere, and he was very supportive and i really wanted him to say no go not take this job for six months because i miss you and he was just supportive so around, we argued about this <laughter> and it was ridiculous, so we laughed at the end and that was the end of the fight, to meditate, go into nature to stay away from the computer, away from technology, away from people., i'd say not really around i'm a single child and it's just me and my parents and we're very dissimilar for example around i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh, couch potatoes that they like to watch reality television, so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do to as far as common activities, so you know i love them and everything, but there's not too much common reason, yeah, i think i'm a very social introvert, but i.., seem to find the most social encounters to empty out where, as my friend for example, he around conducts a lot of joy and energy to people for me it's always a little the opposite that i need to charge, i don't know if i have a best friend, but i guess i'll tell my friend he's kind of my standard best friend., he would probably say passionately intelligent, he always tells me that i'm really hard on me, which is true to be loyal., i think i'm just proud of who i am i don't know if that's the answer most people give, but i think i'm, i'm really proud of who i am i'm trying really hard around i have a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's kind of rare to find people who are friendly and i look at myself, a friendly person who cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so i'm proud of it, < slaughter>, no i didn't, no, yes, i was probably about fifteen at the time, so i think eight was that seventeen years ago, yes, i cut and my, named one of my best friends, to call my parents and let them know and at this point they took me with them for treatment, i wasn't the first time i'd ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before it was more, they thought i had a d h d so much, it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in instead of asking me for help, i haven't stopped for about three years, uh, because it felt like i checked in with a probation officer i just didn't enjoy the relationship i had, but i still have the psychiatrist i'm going to for medical controls, < slaughter>, i think it's useful if you have the right therapist, i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist, it can be incredibly harmful that i have spoken to people who have had bad experiences and will never go back., lately i've been a little down around i should say a little down as usual because i graduated and, my routine to go to school, and make school supplies twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it is a little, strange to find out what to do with mine, to find a way to be productive and to know what to do with my time is also a little bit to, depressive statement that my intelligence and good grades at school do not translate into real world skills and there are not so many jobs for marine biologists in california, almost impossible since i was a little kid, i've had trouble falling asleep and.., about four years ago it really got bad, where i just couldn't sleep through the night i got about four hours of sleep, sometimes i would wake up every hour and i would only wake up a complete wreck in the morning, so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep, you're a virtual person, so you probably didn't see that, but it's pretty much like i, i'm just a panicked, terrified wreck that i'm losing my ability to deal with., i'm losing my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temperaments, i can't regulate my moods, i'm just really volatile, probably a few months ago i think i might have been on a trip away for a weekend and forget to take my medicine with me or something and then i can't sleep and so it's what happens, uh <makes sounds with mouth>, really happy i mean to, i don't know, it's easy for me to keep track of when i feel really bad really happy i think i felt happy on new year's eve, really happy on new year's eve, that was around, ten days ago i was with my friend and some friends and we went on a trip to palmspring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them, i can't see them very often because i was in school and i was so busy, so it was really a nice reintroduction to real life., i think i'm nice, i'm considerate, i'm tolerant, i'm pretty open minded, i'm aware of my mistakes., i'm just trying to be nice to everyone and, i'm very curious about the world and things i don't know that i really like to learn, uh from the top of my head first thing that came to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really, me and my friends we know have jumped off the boat and you come across the edge of this, uh limestone sink hole and it's really blue and you just fall on about forty hundred feet in, something like two minutes, we did it pretty fast not everyone could do it so fast and around when you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge, they're bigger than people and because it's that, cave system and it is really cloudy and there are sharks swimming everywhere around you so, that was pretty good <laughter>, i try to remember that i haven't had much free time in the last three and a half years when i was in school around <laughter> so i guess reading hiking around, i'm just dating my friends., relatively low key things going in movies with dinner parties cooking with my cat playing, not that i can really think about it, i'm sure i made mistakes in my life, but you know i'm still here, so i can't be that bad, hmm, um, i don't know if you're holding on to your clothes, 'cause the '90s are back in fashion., hmm, to be cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets in around outside in nature, type of away from the hub of the city get a good note <laughter>, i think my friend just gave it up, especially last year, he really inspired me that he stopped drinking he stopped smoking he's, he really inspired me that he stopped drinking, he made many positive changes in his life and i know these things aren't difficult or not easy, i should say to <t> to see someone overcome such a thing that, i was really inspired., all right.",10

328,"yes, < slaughter>, how are you?, uh watts california but now i live in west l a, <laughter> yes, i love the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that around you are thirty minutes away from everything it is a great city, the traffic is terrible, i studied child development, yeah, actually, i teach kids how to be safe in uh traffic situations, oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker, that's what i want to do, i want to die by doing this job movies, well, when i was in high school, i did a lot of theater productions and i love everything about film, so i once had the opportunity to make a movie because i didn't get a job as an actor, i just became addicted i love film making, < slaughter>, last time i made a film, only this last october made a short film., there are about three people who connect, but they come to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they originally imagined., thank you., really crazy uh, <laughter> really crazy i, you know, i guess what makes me really angry is when my daughter is acting stupid at school, when she doesn't do her job, and when she doesn't watch and i get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences, that's what makes me angry., yeah, that's good., yeah, yeah, it sucks that she's one of the smartest kids in her school., no, it's very difficult because many things in themselves that, they're going negative to them and it's as if you're fighting against yourself trying to change, but you know that little person you are, you know a hundred times, and it's just hard to deal with, but.., except that it's okay, but being a parent is never easy, <sigh>, the hardest part about being a parent, i'd say,, try to give, this little person so much life experience, so they don't make mistakes or so they don't get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away, but then they don't do it so, it's getting very uh, um, annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the information and they don't want to take it, they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt, it's sad and then they want to come to you and you're like ugh, i tried to tell you, but you can't be mad at them because everyone learns their own way so, mm, yeah, i guess for a while, when you think about it, uh, when you see them go through their fights, it's hard to watch, but it is a necessary movement of life children must learn how they want to learn, because as soon as they get it they will have it the same way, however they get it, you as a parent are glad they have it., all the love the children give you, yeah she loves <lo> you know love you and especially my daughter, who she always wants to give me hugs, she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i do a great job when i'm like < laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but, they know that they have this unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for, that the children tell you that you're a good person., i like that., hmm, oh,, ooh <sigh> you know it as if albert einstein said it best that our technology has surpassed our humanity., and there's so much technology out there that kids learn so fast that it's almost like they're little adults, but.., they miss the steps to being a child, they miss going outside, they miss learning about things naturally, rather than just going to youtube or, they know where always facebook and get it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information, and they just have to fight through all this information and they're not growing up organic kids these days it's not organic it's puffed up it's pushed, and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world, so that's what's wrong, hmm, me <laughter> just breathe in and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation, argued, i had a fight with my fianc e a few months ago., god i forgot i forgot i don't remember, it was petty., yeah, but it didn't take long, because she's like me, that she doesn't like discussing things that we like to care about when it happens and that's it., hmm, my fianc e, well, i mean, we met when i was at, with a charter <ch> not a charter school, but with a, recreation center we met there and we talked that we haven't seen each other for a whole year., and then we got back together and we went on a date and it was great since, my family we are pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a father who lives in a neighboring city where i am around, as close as possible with the distance and certain decisions that my family have made over the years, you know, far away and, but my immediate family like you knows my fianc e and my daughter, like we're close and it's great., < slaughter>, i don't travel enough, but i've traveled a few times uh within the last five years i just came out of new zeal and so that was a great experience, yeah, that's good., i enjoy meeting new people who are the biggest in travel, i like to see new things that i like to immerse myself in different cultures and situations and i like, just being away from her, that's good too., well, i went to new zeal and uh not too long ago and i had <ha>, i've been learning about celsius for a week because you know, here we have fahrenheit and that was fun, uh, i learned how to play cricket, uh i learned how to get out of a capsized kayak, and i've learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb, but they had a lot of lamb oh and their seafood < seaf> seafood i can't eat, but they have really great chocolate chocolate is <sigh> it was so good, and ice cream was also good and uh people were really very nice they it was a very special time for me to go there it was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back, yeah, that's it., some of my best qualities around, energetic uh very sympathetic uh intelligent, i'm just getting together with me i work pretty hard, and i'm very slow to get excited about things, no, mm it's pretty simple, i think i'm getting pretty moody, you know, i could be a little snappy with people if i don't sleep well when i, lack of sleep, but as soon as i get some sleep, i'm okay, mm fine, no, , um, you know, he'd say i'm pretty funny about lax about a lot of things, uh, life as much as i can, to have good friend and always ready and eager to help, <laughter> just wake up in the morning <laughter> it's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good, i love laughing ugh when someone laughs especially my fianc e, because she has a great laugh then, that puts me in a good mood, hmm, thank you., , and that's what i want to do, i definitely want to work in acting and really get some really good roles, so he was a positive influence he stayed out of trouble, he has a good working relationship with people and he is always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging, oh, we went to junior high school and high school together, so he's my best friend., yeah, that's good., <laughter> yes it is, wow there are so many uh, , had this bag m and m's and we had gone to a game, and there were two girls who were a few rows down that you know we weren't particularly interested, but you know that's what kids are like, just that they don't know how you know they don't like anybody, but you know,, anyway, we got this m and m's and while it was dark, we started to throw m and m's and hit them in the head with the m's and m's and then we came to school like three days later we were called and there was a sham process, to get, , so we could free ourselves from it as if the whole group of the crime did not make us guilty, and then we got into trouble anyway, because our teacher just didn't want to allow us to get into trouble, so we had to clean up the farm for two days., oh man you call it uh i love diving i've only done it twice, but i love it wants to go back into it like traveling, i love to train, i like to train now, uh, i thought it was a duty, but now i'm really getting into it, that i love watching movies that you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so, that's it, hanging out with the family., everything i regret to him < deep breath> you know what i think i think < slaughter> i probably regret, not, go to will schmied when i had the chance, yeah uh wants blacksmith came up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped into the bushes and, i haven't met him yet. my boss thought it was funny, but i wasn't ready to meet him yet, but i think i regret meeting him., advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago, i would probably say that if my stomach told me to do something, i just kept doing it and did it instead of sitting and analyzing it you know days weeks months later, if i feel it in my stomach i should go for it with my stomach more, really happy, hmm, really happy i had a film festival that i put together and things were so intense that we went wrong, but then it went right, but then people came and grabbed the house, i was really glad we had a packed house at this uh film festival, so that was about a month ago., yeah, that's good., <sigh> let's see, i think now at this point i'm very proud to have a short film along with a minimal budget, but it has amazing actors it has a great plot line and, i didn't think it could be done, but it's done or done nearby, and i'm proud that i was

a realtor instead, to be on a t v show, it's pretty hard to be discovered and uh, you must be lucky and know the right people and be talented, <laughter> yeah, not really no, i don't travel so much that i moved to another city every few years and then i've been here for a while, so i don't travel much, the weather, there's always something to do, and, that's pretty much it <laughter>, um, people here tend to be a little ruder, and around it is only always a fast pace, well, when i moved here, i was twenty five, so it was much more fun, because when you're young in town, you can have a lot of fun, and then i came into the real estate and did really good for a while and then the market crashed and so now i'm old and i'm not making money, so times are hard, no no i am much more <m> more an extroverter, um, if i don't get what i want <laughter> and around, rude people, and, only ruthless people, i'm pretty good at controlling my temper if i'm not like drinking alcohol, it would make my temper worse, but if i don't drink, i'm pretty good at controlling my temper., the last time i had a fight with someone was, someone who owed me money, uh i live uh in westhollywood, no i live alone i have a dog, it's good, i mean, i don't like my neighbors, i hate my neighbors, but the ones upstairs just moved out, so that's good news hopefully the ones who move in aren't so loud and the lower ones i just can't stand because they're arguing with me, what are you doing?, why, because they say because of my hardwood floors that, i've been there for ten years and they're still arguing about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors, yeah, that's good., what was the question?, my mother was a very positive influence that she always tracked me down., she lived with me for the last ten years until she moved to rhode island recently to live with my brother., very close to my mother, not so close to my brother, but we're not so close to me., um, so i mean, we love each other, we just don't get along all the time., from the, life of the party, ambitious for, and sometimes cut throat, on what i am most proud of, always able to be through the things i need to get through where i want to be, i'm generous, i'm loyal., i'm kind., i'm accommodating, and, that's it., no, yes, about four years ago, to be good i had <ha> i was beaten and i had uh identity theft, and, uh, you know, i was just scared to leave, so i had to get over spending a year like this in my house without leaving, um and just depressed all the time i said i had to get out and start talking to people and so i got, thank you., okay, i'm panicking about the job situation, you know, because my bills are pretty high and i don't have a stable income right now., so that's what worries me the most is my uh financial situation, yeah, that's good., um , yes, i mean, well basically it's like i just stopped drinking together recently, so i don't drink anymore, so i realize, yeah, i mean, it's good because number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like how i handle when i drink, so that's a positive thing, but now that i drank, it helped me just forget and numb me., now i have to feel through the feelings that are pretty good because i can talk my way through them, so i guess i'm developing, yeah, a long time ago, you know, i took a lot of medication here and there, and.., they really would numb some of them me some of them would, i feel hyper that's how i recently decided to take < t> three to six months in the last six months just to take nothing, so i don't take anything i barely take an aspirin, just to get my body into a normal state, uh, not really., always worry about just a lot of worries getting worried about everything, oh what happens when i'm in a car accident, what happens when i can't pay my mortgage, what happens when i, eh eh anyway just so many things i worry about and that was what depresses me, i know., at a certain point i had, a few good therapists and i had some bad therapists, i like the ones who talk to me., and give me some guidance in contrast to those who just listen, and then they just say, okay, your time is so high and just prescribe me medications, so i think i'd be better off with a psychiatrist < psychiatrist> psychologist than a psychiatrist, um, well, i'm not going to therapy right now, but.., the therapy i had before, it was more like people trying to just come in, check me in and give me medication., i had another therapy where i was back and forth, like okay. well, that's what i'm thinking about, and you're thinking about it, and this kind of therapy is better., um, i'm just.., i didn't get the right therapists recently., so i knew the root of my problem was drinking because it's a depression., you know that stopping drinking definitely has me a much clearer mind and just working through things you know yourself, um , i can't think of anything right now., um , it's been a long time since i can't really think of a time when i felt really happy., thank you very much <sniffle>, um , okay, when i was a kid, um , i had a little dog and that big dog came and attacked him and killed him., so then a little later my father, came and he said to my brother and me, we were kids going to the car, there are two packages in the car, so get them., so i was like yeah because i never listened to my parents, so i was like a spoiled brat, but finally he said go to the car, what is that?, oh okay, he said go to the car and get that out of the car so i finally left and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food, so that's one of my memorable experiences, yeah, because i'm an animal lover., um, the way i treated the people before, when, i was hurt i was really mean or rude to the people, when i felt like you knew i was hurting i had to hurt everyone around me so, um, but when i've been drinking since i heard that i didn't do it so, so i think the problem is drinking and now that i let that go because i did it for the wrong reasons, you know that i did it to not believe i didn't do it to be sociable, get in a career that is really stable, like uh eh you know like a doctor or a nurse or a lawyer, something you know, or in advertising i would have in that a selling position it could be very good and very good or very bad so, you must always be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales, but if you make your money, save your money don't go spending it on extravagant things, when i have a job when i'm able to work, when i help other people, when other people around me are happy and laugh, when i can make people laugh, that makes me in a good mood, okay, thanks., you're welcome, thank you., see you.",8

a year or two., you know i'm away from my family., what i was used to in new york, the neighborhoods the people and only ever acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here, the weather, you can't beat the

interested in movies since i was a kid., and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination, i've been in the last, likely, almost ten years i have travelled more than i had in the past <pa> well, i have always traveled, even as a child my parents would travel around, so yes., seeing new places and uh seeing people who are different than i see how they live, and take to the sights, uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever had to go on the safari and, just going out in a jeep and seeing <laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible, oh yes, this is one of the great experiences of my life, and i also got to uh, a place in egypt uh at the end of this trip, um, uh, called uh, sharm el sheikh, which is right on the

do i like to listen to music, i like watching movies helps me relax, because it brings me out of you to know whatever could be in my head, i meditate every day, i like to take walks in nature, which is always reassuring, especially down at the uh of the ocean, uh, what it depends on <laughter> sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times, uh , i will do like a form of self hypnosis and calm myself down, which is something i have recently learned how to do, which is very helpful, and also since i'm not meditating it about things as easily annoyed as i have done in the past, some things that really makes me angry, i think uh think about injustice, done in the world or to people when, uh, it doesn't really have to be that we could all get along., um , and make the world better,

questions?, take advantage of every opportunity that came my way, always <alway> i think say yes, uh on every occasion is very important and doesn't matter, how you think you know you need to be confident that you will be able to achieve what you want to do, no, but i was depressed in my life., uh for the most part i have felt good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh, i think you sometimes know if i allow <allo>, regret to come into my mind that can bring me down, but i can usually tell you to come out when it's pretty fast, uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh, an opportunity around how to explain it anyway there, sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is a way i that if i had made another decision, i could have more money or my life would be different, um , not really i mean i feel, pretty much the same, what made me look for help for <laughter>?, i've been good okay, it generally helped talk to someone when i did that., i have no problem sleeping., uh ,

<f> i'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little mysterious, to i would probably that i should, they would like to see me achieve more and uh and uh reach my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier, i think.., it's hard, it depends, sometimes i'm very introverted because i like to write so it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i'm out of this uh i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself with, as one hard way or the other everything depends on my situation and my mood, my best qualities around, i think i'll take care of it, i think i'm smart, i think i'm funny, i'm going out., um, i have a sympathetic personality, you know that people said that, i'm captivating, but not oppressive or overly captivating, there's some kind of cool detachment., um, and creatively intuitive, <laughter> yes <laughter>, the last time i felt really happy, i don't know that i woke up this morning, i was pretty happy, i had breakfast i was happy, the sun was shining, <

334,"all right., yes, pretty good a little tired, washtone seattle washton , when i was 18, my parents decided we wanted to move to california, so we moved to pasadena., yeah, that's good., i went to work about two years ago and took a look at the area, pretty simple actually, i'll adjust., the warm weather not with rain nine months of the year around, population in the first place, the uh the area, how big it is traffic, when i first came here, the smog, that's better now, no, when i was younger, i was but i got away with the work i did., sure, when i became, when i died my mother and i needed work, i went for a job called petition, and uh you have to go to the stores and talk to people about signing petitions, and you do that after a while you won't be shy about talking to someone, even when i was in school, i took public speaking and i learned that it really liked more than i thought i would, so i did the census job that i actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to do the test and i enjoyed it., right now, i'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance., um, and i'll start working uh trying to get money from people uh help kids in the uh in the world, well, the one on the uh job helping kids was also a paid job i needed a paid job, the uh one for insurance i was getting older and i needed work that was steadfast and that's something i can do until i'm eighty five or ninety or whatever., < slaughter>, to be an artist, well, i was good with art, i like painting et cetera, but i didn't know if i could ever live with it, so i never really came in and every time i tried, i never seemed to have come anywhere, so maybe if i'm like eighty or ninety maybe i'm going to go into ceramic or something like that and do that as a profession, not unfortuantely i do not, that's okay., i'm not, my mother and father are dead i have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or i don't talk to them or anything, well, i have a kind of attitude that if i have myself and friends i'm okay, uh read, uh, watch sports when they are available, uh let's see i used to play golf i can do that again one day, but not now because of the cost and time, people who are rude, well, normally i ignore it this morning actually i told a guy to stop what he did and we got some kind of argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done, very good because i had a very bad temper when i was a child and i told myself that i had to control it, this morning because of the guy who makes a lot of noise., and in a place that just wasn't the place to do it, i mean, it was a public place, but.., and that was just a small argument and i'm done with the argument as soon as i say what i say <laughter>, yes, not now that i can think, uh how to read, um, when i can travel i travel uh i don't travel long distances, but even out to the river is a kind of adventure for me, seeing things on the way, and back, talk to people, maybe, well a number of years ago i went back east to uh massachusetts, to work there on the way back, i took a greyhound bus all the way back from washton d c all the way back to california, uh into the washtone first and then from down there, and uh, work in massachusettes for about six months to eight months, enjoyed the area a little, but didn't want to be there when the snow came, and uh, enjoyed back in the bus had people near me almost all the way different people and, had a lot of fun, yeah, that's good., yes, i was in the air force and uh when i was eighteen nineteen sixty five during the vietnam war, no i was in big falls montana, it really didn't years later i probably uh learned more from the fact that i got out early and maybe i would have stayed in, and stayed there, but i tended to end things when i was younger and so now that and other things i decided never to end anything, i came down here uh played pool for a number of years uh finally graduated from high school that i had dropped when i moved, uh went to college got my bachelor's degree and an a a degree from pasadena and cal state l a and started working different jobs and uh that's it, took care of my mother, uh business that was my head i also studied cyclical anthropology and philosophy and history et cetera, no, not never depressed <de>, lately not so good between the fact that i sleep in my car and it's very cold and then sometimes i get uh, and with all the things in my life right now i'm thinking about things and so and plus i get up at four thirty in the morning, that's okay., uh tired, and sometimes i get a little grumpy but not very, tired with all the things i had to do and uh weather and sleep, no, uh a little sometimes about how maybe i should have started all this years ago, i'll just keep going., i'm basically telling myself to stop it and keep doing what things to improve, not very anymore, it took me years to study to do that., i don't know if you call it zen or not, but, a few months ago, when i passed all my tests, and uh medicare <medi> uh medicare advantage, and all of them for every company she sent to me, i stick to everything i do now, i'm persistent, i won't leave things out of my hands until i do something about it., i used to be uh, what's the word?, i'm putting things away that i don't do anymore., and uh, i always treat people beautiful, until given a reason not to, and i usually don't talk to anyone about my bad stuff, < slaughter>, not very, because the same thing that i have trained over the years, so as not to talk about myself, i'm talking to other people, i'm talking about them., let's see., my mother, gandy, um, bertrand russell, let's see., i'm not sure who else, other people i had, but i don't remember their names or they were teachers et cetera, earlier in life uh like i said uh everything didn't end things i'm very sorry about, nope., i could have done better., probably the advice i've given myself to get out of my butt and learn and get an education uh and continue to do something with my life, that i have survived, well, i'm sixty five, i slept in my car for a number of years i went from sleeping to sidewalk where i got a car, while i did improve my credit rating, i got a number of jobs that i was very satisfied with., i had a lot of friends., both homeless people who are homeless and not homeless, and uh, i'm in pretty good health, and where like other people in my family died young, so i think that's what this is about., uh good jokes, uh people who have a happy time, go and have a drink with someone on an occasional basis, about eight months ago was the last time i had a beer with someone, let's see., probably uh, always within a foot of a living wild deer, it was in uh green lake in washton, and i uh was behind our house and this wild deer walked in the field and i started moving, and it came within about a foot of me, and the only reason why it left my father drove the ride way and it made noise and the deer ran away i was in fondle distance from him and i wasn't sure if he would have petted or not, but i was about to <laughter>, like you, see you.",5
335,"yes, i'm fine., i'm from here, originally los angeles, mhm, i like the weather, and my family's here, which is why i'm here, i've moved away for a while, i like that there is a lot of, culture <cult> although everyone says that there is no culture in l a, there is a lot of culture, there are theater and film and many museums and so many things that all kinds of people i like the diversity, mhm, um , well, i don't like having to withdraw against my will, so start a new career, i'm starting new in my career, so that's not really something, i retired because my dad was sick., so, thank you., thank you., so that's why i'm here, but it also means that i live with my dad and my brother who are like horter and ridiculous., uh, acting, theatre, it was, mhm, yeah, that's good., yes, i am., i'm an actor, i'm doing a theater show, auditioning and teaching., something like this kind of thing, well, my parents are both, artistic people and i grew around them and for a long time i sang and then uh i went to study music theater, and somewhere along the lines i realized that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose, but i still do both, mhm, no, i don't know., i usually have no problems talking to people, i'm pretty friendly., i can usually tell myself with most people their secrets within five minutes to meet me what i feel is a sign of an extroverted <laughter>, <laughter>um, i take a bath or read a book, go out with my friends, go to the theater, uh, anyway sometimes my work is very relaxing, as sometimes as a song sing or one of them go for a walk, mm hmm yoga, things that drive me crazy, injustice <laughter> i can be very sincerely outraged i suppose to, people who don't see these things and people who have a similar claim, i think, claim and feeling of privilege that can drive me crazy, yeah, that's good., uh , it depends that i usually argue with <usual> often that i appreciate my case <laughter> or i usually call my best friend and complain, talk to her about it, pretty good pretty good i don't have too much temperament, um, like a real argument or like a debate, <laughter>um, if it were a real argument, it would probably be my ex boyfriend, and we were just arguing about why we separated stupid things like this., oh, i think i was kind of, over them until then, but, it was sometimes, < slaughter>, um , the last time i felt really happy, has been, how really happy, probably hanging out with friends last night i had a good time, uh, , it's nice., it's nice., my best friend would describe me as an open book, for which she often makes fun of me, as if she would just tell everyone everything around her would make me, compassionate, and, with a strong feeling about who i am, i think, yes, she would also consider me as not like a good feeling of social norms sometimes likely that is something that she, makes fun of me because i want to tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have holes in my clothes and something like that, but nothing, nothing bad we have a very good relationship, hmm, yeah yeah it doesn't have terrible problems but yes, it got me in trouble before sure, no, i didn't, no, but i think i had it, but i've never been to a doctor., because i had a traumatic situation where someone hurt me., and i, i felt that when i saw p t s d later, i realized that i felt as if i had all the symptoms of how again in situations like that i would panic and it was very, uh i thought it was a really long time, i think.., i think i had it, but i just don't know because i've never seen anyone about it., um , sometimes yes uh, certain physical things with this part of my body can be a trigger or around, it happened in a acting class, so sometimes certain teachers, when they, to criticize in a certain way, i start to panic, even if they're absolutely right and i know they're right and as if it were something that, someone else could tell me and i'd agree to it, sometimes it'll make me a little excited or panicky yeah, no, well, i mean, my dad's sick, so not great, but when you think about it, it's not terrible., i have bad dreams., uh , like stress dreams i'm dealing with my dad., um , like being abducted or my teeth fall things that when you always tell them as if there was something outside your control that's like exactly what it's so, it's not the best, but it's just dreams, at least so, in which direction, all right., easy very simple, i'm tired and maybe a little irritable silly i'm gonna be really silly, yeah, that's good., um, i, i'm pretty non judgmental, from other people i stay open, i can make most people laugh., uh creative, um, i, yes, these are some of the best i would say, yeah, that's good., i love meeting new people and seeing and learning new things uh and just getting out of the routine i like to stay in hotels uh i like most things about traveling i even like to fly i like all of it, well, i just finished a tour a few months ago to go up and down the east coast and then perform across the u s and uh for kids everywhere, yes and then we ended up here in l a, yeah, yeah, it was great, it was a good time, yeah, that's good., um , lemmi we think, we went to, the hot springs the naturally occurring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to relax, yeah, that's good., a lot of people i would say, i mean, my dad's probably coming to my mind., uh my godmother is a great positive influence in my life as well, uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some of my best friends from high school around and college that i somehow grew up with and, will be who i am with them, yeah, that's good., mhm, uh, little things for sure, yeah, that's good., uh, i regret, the way i dealt with it, a friendship that once ended uh i regret, to bind to certain people i was with, uh , but nothing big i tend to go well i won't do it again, but i don't spend much time, how excited about things i've done in the past, hmm, get up for yourself., um , <laughter> don't date criminals <laughter> uh, i think that i, i have no difficulty standing for things i believe in, but sometimes i have difficulty standing up for myself., i think i really internalize the idea of how, you know women are too needy or.., i don't know these kinds of things and then and so as a teenager and growing up i felt like you were good then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took a while to be able to like voice what i want, what i needed from other people and agree with, and it's still something i'm working on, i'm glad you think so., um , <sigh>, that's a good question., my friends and family, and uh, i mean talents, i'd say, yeah, that's good., yes my ability to take situations and, take up bad situations and continue and, make the best of everything, all right., <laughter> thank you, goodbye <laughter>",12
336,"hello., safe, well a little tired, indianapolis indiana, uh i'm a singer, i like to sing, to diversity my girlfriend is uh, from taiwan, so that they are different cultures, transport, the, crazy people, it's.., seems hard to get something really accomplished, < slaughter>, it took about six months to find out the directions, twenty eight years ago, a long time, i haven't been there for eight or ten years., all right., i don't like my brothers, so i don't want to hang out with them., i started my girlfriend uh we got over uh just went back from orlando and uh she likes to travel so, meeting new people, seeing new places, uh helps me get out of l a and get a different perspective, i just did the avatar seminar, which is like a, raise your consciousness and clean up the crap in your head, < slaughter>, um, yeah, i feel better, uh had a lot of psychic attack and, it's uh i'm psychic, so it's very hard to deal with, < slaughter>, um, well, um.., there's more to life than what you see., many things are in other dimensions and in other places, so you need to not only deal with the emotions, but people uh direct energy on you, um, must do a lot of clearing and grounding and, stay true to yourself, i'm both, well, i'm introverted because i like to spend time alone, and i'm extroverted because i like meeting new people uh times was totally introverted, watch movies t v read uh do crossword puzzles i'm a singer singing, writing music i write a novel, it's kind of like the matrix., to good i wrote the first twenty pages pretty fast, so, um.., i'm expanding it now., i get inspiration uh it was actually a dream and then i wrote down the dream and now it's gonna be uh i could probably turn it into a movie, < slaughter>, yeah, that's good., if people don't respect me, that's number one., no, i just that my brothers don't respect me, that they don't really do it., um, you know i want to love my family, but i don't want to hang out with my brothers, so it's a conflict., exactly, pretty good, i get angry only once a year, to my girlfriend about two or three months ago, she wanted me to do something and i said no < yawn> and, i don't know., yeah, that's good., she's my girlfriend i've known for about a year., pretty close, um, once i, sang and, , and i sang in front of an audience and that was great, um, well, i'm looking for ways to expand my consciousness so that i can have more money and more wealth in my life, so i can uh, have my own house and uh live in my own creative space, < sniffle>, i sing i'm a singer so let's see how unforgettable so uh that's what i like to do, no, oh, that's the hard part i don't have., i don't know, maybe it's because when i was, a child who beat up my brothers, and, i don't feel totally rested in myself or in my life like this, uh, i feel like.. < sniffle>, i don't feel quite sure, yeah, that's good., um, a little irritable, but i've been sleeping better since i met my girlfriend, so it's not quite bad, my what, behavior what, i don't know., well, i feel more positive i made the seminar and uh, so i get rid of some crap in my brain < sniffle> and be positive about life, um, well done a lot of exercises uh, reduce my stress and much of my stress comes from uh judgment me and other people, yeah, you could say that., < slaughter>, uh, all right., < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm <

my own good, uh <sniffle> , all right., watch t v gets up, but, <yawn> uh lately i feel like i have to, um, have less judgment and more fun, i did the seminar., um, it was about a week ago, i think, well, i went to this seminar i got there, i was able to, lose work and be <yawn> < sniffle> in a different environment because my work is stressful and < sniffle>, my life is so stressful, uh <sniffle> i was able to take a break that is great, i'd say i'm going away fun smart, uh, but i mean in l a people in l a they don't want most of them don't want to spend time with you, i don't know if it's me or me., < slaughter>, uh, that i spend a lot of time worrying and criticizing myself instead of making progress, avoid it, watch t v or watch movies or try not to think about it, but it doesn't solve the problem, well, a little bit i didn't pay my bills much, which i still owe., it is a kind of self destructive prophecy <proph> prophecy, uh stop criticizing and, start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen, my friend was very helpful., well, she's funny and she loves me and takes care of me and, uh, <laughter> yeah, to singer and i am intelligent and creative and multi dimensional and, uh, i'm a good listener, well, i've written about four or five books i uh, my voice that i think is number one, because when i started, i didn't have much of a singing voice, but now i do., goodbye., see you.",7
337,"yeah, that's good., i'm fine., how are you?, i am originally from a suburb of l a from the san gabriel valley, i like the variety i like the atmosphere of the city i have lived other places and it's just, not, as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here, so i like l a, like all the things that are so close together, then there are a lot of interesting things that are completely different parts of the city only miles from each other, uh, may not like the traffic all cars but i can live with it i mean, there's not so much i don't like, i studied music for vocal performance i studied music technology things like, yes, i'm singing in an opera company, but i have a day job because it doesn't pay so much if you don't work for the opera., so i have a day job that i work in a call center that mainly works on, actors and actors and such things and it's really good, because when i get a call, i can call and change my shift very easily., so it's actually a pretty good gig, and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know there's some recording some live sound thing, but i'm kind of wanting to get away from the, do some video work sometimes, but again i want to go away from that i want to go back to the, because i find that more performance is more interesting i like talent more than i like crew <laughter>, so somehow i want to get away from this side and start working more towards actually doing what i want to do with my life, sometimes i mean by my personal life yeah so i have a bowl that i get out there to deal with people, but when i'm home, you know, i'd rather think of myself or my husband or my cats or talk to the family., you don't really have too many close friends < clears throat> but yeah you know, i'd rather stay with me., mediocrely close to the family i've left, i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so, but how, thanks <laughter> but how uh my i'm close to my husband and, you know, i have some cousins i'm talking to, and my aunt i have an aunt with who i'm talking to a little bit, but it's not like we interact close by every day., but it's, a little short, mostly i sing or read or write or, only, hang and try, clarifies my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work, but i try to do that and try to just, make everything clear and see what comes back in, and, sometimes <ss> sometimes that sometimes it doesn't work, but mostly to create things, to contact my family, some <so> you know about facebook or whatever, works, but, mostly in my spare time i create things, i would like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot around, i mean, my idea of, like a birthday party, going on a road trip, and i like to travel around more, i would love to travel for work things or whatever, but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to travel, see <see> uh especially traveling by car seeing how the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know how to change the vibrations of the region feel, i like to see what's out there and i know that there's a bigger world outside of, where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see this, but i like to leave this and go back to my own world <laughter>, <laughter> < empties the throat> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <l, um, let's see., a trip i like to take is to take the trip from here to nevada, whether i go all the way to vegas or just go state line, around my cousin and i would take what we call, leave a ride because once you reach the first exit of a highway, you are either in another state or you are at the end of the highway, so we would take the only, type of improvisation with how <li> a day or two notes just move things around just stand out, so these are actually trips i like to make because i take off and then sometimes on the same day sometimes overnight, only small short trips, which, are not very involved, but you can just walk and see things and see how, to you know the desert landscape looks at different seasons, how people react at different times of the year in different areas, so close to home, but not, but not close to home near home, but uh still a world away, so because i don't really take time like a two week vacation or whatever, but these are just small things that, somehow things back in perspective and and my head and things like that clear, i mean because there's a kind of feeling of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't drive on a highway, so i like to do that, the last time that happened was may of last year, that was the last time i could do that, we actually came my aunt with my cousin who is ten years younger than i am, and we grew up kind of like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland kingdom where they live, so they took me to one last hurrah and we drove up to vegas, and looked around and came back because i actually lived in vegas for a while, but i didn't like it, so she kind of, i showed them some of the local websites around there, and we came back and were, you know, an overnight stay, but we were driving like this all the time <laughter>, it was kind of an interesting, things that are by nature unfair when people are mean to older people, children or animals, people who cannot fight back, and they are mean to them just because they can't fight back, and, i'm actually.., how to see people who are, strong <st> as strong as the people who want to stand up and be an advocate, or what's wrong with you?, so i think this is one thing that really makes me angry just being cruel or mean for no reason, you don't know people for people who can't fight back, or for people who didn't do anything to earn it., just that somehow really drives me crazy, if i am angry, i will try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me, then i will somehow end lasching out either, you know, orally, just, cut it with a quip or, you know, i mean, i'm rarely gonna yell at anyone, but i'm trying to tell you., if i try to go away and defuse it if it doesn't work, then i let them know that they're annoying me and coming away from me <laughter> that usually works, not in like legal problems or so, because normally i will find a way to, i want you to leave me alone., um, so there aren't really big problems, but because i think it's because it's gone putting and it's not expected < exp> the expected reaction, and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because i know that's gonna work and get people away from me, so it's not really in trouble and if, it's trouble, it's usually trouble,, it's from the perspective of the other person and it doesn't affect me at all, because it's usually a situation i can get out of., as long as they leave me alone, you know, i'm not leaving., last time i was fighting with someone., for example , person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or someone not in my, the last thing i can think about was, i, quarreling with my husband about the care of my mother in law because she has dementia, and if we were one of the reasons we came here from the inland kingdom, we were to take care of her, because she's not going anywhere, except l a, i mean, she's like hardcore angelino as you know we know we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live somewhere else, but we came here to take care of them., and he wants her to stay in her apartment, and i want her to move in with us., because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she were to live with us, but she wants to stay where she is because she cannot see that there is now inherent danger due to the disease process, but he wants her to stay where she's supposed to be, that she's able to have what she wants, because he's a mama boy like, i'm a mama girl, although i lost my mother, like four years ago, i'm still a mama girl and i'm still going to be <st> and i'm still and i know that, it, brings you, a feeling of satisfaction to fulfill their wishes because you care so much about them and that's what they want, so you want to get it for them and because you know that they know that this has happened to you, when you grew up trying to give you what you want because you wanted to., and you want to do that for them now, like a way to give them back someone you care about someone you feel you deserve., but it's kind of dangerous for her, and i don't want anything to happen to her., but i want her to stay, who she is, as long as she can, because i know how to erase the disease that she has, who she is, after all,, and finally she has to be taken to a place where she can give her twenty four hours of medically trained care, but until then, we can deal with you knowing it between us because it's not that bad., but it comes where she really shouldn't live anymore <shou>, so the solution now is he stays there most of the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do, i handle the outer things that i lead the errands i bring them to the store things like that he makes the day to day things make sure she has <ha>she eats makes sure that they know that clean clothes things like the, so i mean, it's a partnership, it's a partnership, it's a partnership., a double effort it is very much a double effort, but i want her to move in with us, so it was like, a source of it is not really like screaming screaming argument, but, lively discussion <laughter>, you know as a debate, meh, it's not insurmountable, i mean, life will never be easy., and if that's what it is, then you should be worried, because someone can pull the carpet out under you., as long as you're above everything and present in your life, it won't be easy., but you deal with it and you keep moving, uh the most positive influence i believe were probably my mother and grandmother, because my mother was pretty much a single mother and my grandmother helped raise me and she actually, gave me a lot of trust, and were realistic about it, so i mean, i think i have some kind of, realistic kind of downer temperament for me, but they helped me see that it's just inside me and it's not something i can't get over, and that you know life goes on, you know my mom would say to me if you were 40, you're 40, whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life., and i think that was a big influence on how i lived, how i lived my life since she died, i regret that i did not take care of myself in my mother's last year of life because i think it has clouded some of my decisions., now i have underlying conditions and everyone in my family is diabetic and i didn't care when she was the last year of her life because i was too busy getting her home, i wanted to take her home., so i didn't eat properly, i didn't take my insulin properly, i made myself insulin resistant that this year just because my blood sugar was as high as a year, eating only terrible food when i ate, so it really took a toll and i really got very sick, and i wonder well if i don't, if i had taken care of myself and had my head completely straight and my vision and thoughts were not complete, were not clouded, i would have made better decisions on her behalf, especially if she needed them., and when she needed me to step in and make the decisions for her because she, she had a health disaster because she had a kidney, and she had kidney damage that led to kidney failure., your health insurance provider misses that, so she ended up with, such a kind of this whole thing, disaster where everything began to break at once, she had a stroke like a fifties, which she had a small stroke., and it just went down from there, so i think well, if i hadn't, if i had taken care of a better care of myself, i would have been able to take better care of her, and i know, there was nothing i would have been able to prevent her death, but what if i had been able to make it easier for her, if i'd taken care of myself and that's like a great regret i've had, oh, i know i'm <laughter> but it's, my desire to take responsibility, for everyone and everything that matters to me to take responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really do, to direct them into my own vision because they are their own, individuals, and they do not know, be what i want them to be and i know they won't be, but i still have you know my ideals, and i want the way that i want everything to go and i want everyone who is important to me to be happy and also to be able to, fits into my life, in a way in the best possible way, but i know because they are other beings, and i know i won't be able to do that for them, and they won't be able to do that for me, but it's still my ideals, so sometimes i have to look at it and go well, is what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually their, and i know it's theirs, so if you really care about someone, you're just gonna support them and go with them, but.., it's still, kind of hard <laughter> for me and i know i have to get through it, um, ten or twenty years ago, probably to be in the beginning of my own life because i wound up around my mother i mean her, became sick literally the weekend i finished in college <laughter> and i had a job set up and i had to pull out of it because she needed me to take care of her, and i think i would have been more aggressive if i had started my own life getting a job out there., the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like this built up instead of just completely her daughter for about ten years, so, i think i probably would have done that., but i'm telling myself that you keep who you are and learn to separate., you are who you are and what you have to do for your family, to keep a feeling of yourself that is probably what i would have done and do things for myself to keep that feeling of myself that is probably the supply of what i would give myself, ten years ago <laughter>, no, but probably because i didn't go to the doctor because i don't want to know., and i mean, it's not, i know there were times in my life when i was very depressed and it's usually circumstances., and had to pull me out of her, but i'd rather pull myself out of her before i resort to treatment., and it gets <ge>, um, after my mother died, i mean, it had been such a long fight for a year that we had lost and i didn't know it., if i was responsible for logically doing so, i knew it wasn't me., but, how could i convince myself, two weeks after her death, i'm with, pulmonary embolism, in one in each lung because i didn't look at myself for a year and i thought, oh i'm thirty years old when, you know what i'm doing to myself, i can't get over any laughter, but.., i mean, i had to take more medication., because of the, it was a struggle to get my own health back to be able to, to get out of this depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden., the carpet was pulled out my like ground fell out of my world after that so, that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression around i was almost divorced because it was because i just didn't want anything anymore, so, and i was really away from my husband, until that time we were married for about two years at this point and i started very far away from him just pushing everything away just, you know what i'm gonna do with the rest of my life., and it, it's already, a fight you know, you mean there are times when i couldn't get up., just stay in bed and sleep all day you know., but then, to recognize that , when my mother died, i had four cats to watch for two, my two are her and so i adopted the two who were her, i mean good, they have no choice if they can buy their own food and buy their own food., i took the responsibility to do it for them., so that was a motivating factor that they had no choice whether i would get up or not and take care of them, i mean, i could go without eating, i could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't, they didn't know., they actually have me up and, and let me go and face things, even if i didn't want to, not only didn't just want to somehow lure and die, but that wouldn't have been my choice and they i mean what would happen to them, if i wasn't there to take care of her, they'd be, you know sent to a shelter or whatever likely, and maybe they wouldn't have taken me back and adopted me from someone else, maybe they'd have been killed., for me i mean to make selfish decisions for me, so it's like i need someone to take care of me to get me out of bed <laughter> and that was actually a motivating factor, because i found out that if it were just me, i would be able to live without a lot of stuff, i mean, i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it not to be a big deal i don't care, as long as i did what i wanted to do with my life, but, i need to take care of a family., so i have to get out and do things, you know, i need to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day you know, day job i need to know you,, but i'm trying to find a balance between the two, because that's what i want to do with my life, but still i have to take care of my family, so i'm, work on a balance between the two, very <laughter> but it's worth it, i mean,, it would be very i would have much less things to worry about if i only lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>, but keep, a residence below pay bills things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it, you know, if you want something <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through it, and i and i know that, but, it's gonna be hard sometimes you want to give up, but then, it's how good what the alternative is, i mean, i don't think i could live a pleasant life., because if i did, i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be something uncomfortable or i won't do anything to myself i'll just be, be happy to just stay in bed all day, hang out with my cats or whatever, and i wouldn't do anything, very, scary and nervous and i mean what if, i can't find it., enough you know enough work to pay my rent or whatever if.., you know what if i can't?, to keep, a similarity of stability in my life and it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable, but, what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs, and i don't think it's things that didn't happen and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that didn't happen and i know that, but it still happens <ha> it's still crawling in, so this is actually, a source for, anxiety, but then try to let the fear go by doing things by finding out the things that make a solid plan and go after it., but i know it's a cycle, and i'll assume to be really scared and oh my god, what am i going to do, what am i going to do to say okay what is, the basic thing i have to take from here, i mean what <wha> what is only foreign and what can <c> what can what, is what are the actual non problems and what is the real problem, and so, figure out how to do things this way and then the fear starts to disappear a little bit, but then something will pop up and what will pop up again, mm i have to, uh , find out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know what seems huge on the surface when you start hacking it away, you get over it pretty fast, you get through., the last time i felt really happy, i don't know., zz, um, i , huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually really <ac> that actually surprisingly dull me, because sometimes i feel happy sometimes not so much sometimes just kind of, in the middle, um, really how happy happy i don't know, i can't imagine when this happened., i don't know you don't know., i mean perceptions of other people, probably as someone who, strangely enough, someone who is left behind and you know,, treats things as they come, but i don't see myself like this, in general, and it's a, probably that i can think on my feet and, i'm not afraid., huss my ass away and do whatever i need to survive and do things, to do this., and i can make it creative and i try,, search for balance, likely, probably the best things about me <laughter>, that i basically do what i want with my life, although it's not all easy it's not, um, you know, i'm not financially good or what it's still a lot more than many people can say about their lives because i have an aunt i really don't talk to, who and the reason i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable, i mean, she's got, a career that they, it's more like a job she fell into, because my older aunt loves animals, but she didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog nurse., and she was really good at it she had a stable business for a long time, but her hands <ha> know that she began to get arthritis in her hands and, she had.. my cousin's father.., stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business, and she retired early because she retired early between that and arthritis., she occupied my younger aunt, who was still a dog nurse, but she hates it, and it's like you're changing your life so much when you change your life., and the thing i'm most proud of is, yeah, i'm not as financially good at what she is, but i do what i want with my life you know i can, being creative i can have creative people around me that i really like to talk to around me, people i really like in my life and, to be satisfied with, and i see a lot of people who don't, and it gives me a feeling of maybe a bloated feeling of complacency to be able to say i'm not so, and i actually do what i want, although there are victims i still basically do what i want with my life now, thank you very much <laughter>, all right., thank you very much <laughter>, goodbye.",10

it's not hard at all, because all you have to do is take your time and think about everything you've been through, and take a close look at the situation and, uh.., and then go from there and find out what is what really bothers you, it is very rare, uh i suffer from p t s d and uh get this kind of sleep, would be great, because i have recurring nightmares, so of an incident like this, <sigh>, i think it's and i don't know what it's triggering, but i think it's and that's why i'm talking to someone or someone because i'm a veteran, at the uh v a about the situation now, about the p t s d at the moment, excuse me, ma'am., uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares many problems many anger problems uh depression, i've noticed all this in me and uh, i started telling myself i needed help., and that's basically it, i just know, i just know that i was something not wrong with him something wasn't right with me, and if something's wrong with me, i have to take some time to look at myself well and ask myself if something's right, if something's right, then that's fine, if something's wrong, then you have to take care of it., and uh i just started looking for help down there yes, something yes, it's something, because i can sit down and talk to the therapist., well, i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and tell them my situation, and we're usually going to go through the problem., and uh, i went to class to talk to my doctor, so it helps me a little., yeah, that's good., it's a good thing., excuse me, ma'am., no, no, not really., my best friend, she would describe me as a funny loving good person always there trying to help others uh, think more of others really than of myself, but if i know i have to do things for myself, i'll take care of it., so you know it, and they really look up to me, they have a lot more respect for me., yes, they see something in me, they wish that they, excuse me, ma'am., uh you can be a little more specific, oh, all right., uh books crossword puzzle, walk, that's it., i thought i did, but i don't think i regret anything because, that's what it is, this is the way it is to me, so i accept it and i move on, because if i regret something in the past, then i'm wasting my time on it because it's gone, that's the past i have to move on, i have to live in the present so that i can be prepared for the future so that i can go into the future., yeah, that's good., <sharp inhalation>, uh <sigh> more education uh, i am more direct and trusting in what i do, as i am today, so yes, that was what i was missing about twenty years ago, uh yes <ye> yes i had been a lot of positive people in my life, uh.., yes some people would uh uh well consistent <cons> i mean consistently motivating me, a certain goal to pursue and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot, and uh, he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things, because all you do is make a choice, it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that the choice is still to be done on you for it, excuse me, ma'am., uh.., that i am able to really be motivated myself, and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things that i thought i couldn't, but it can be achieved, when i'm ready to put the will to do it, oh wow huh, oh really and you know what i really enjoyed, sat with my social worker and we talk about doing things in my life., and school was one of them uh, and just school was one of them and i liked it because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me, yes and i thought that was a great thing as long as you're ready to do that, i'm ready to even go the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school, and yes, that and that and that get me going, oh it's and i love it and uh that will be achieved, thank you., goodbye.",11

course she starts screaming and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter>, yes, it does., thank you., my grandma always gives me encouragement and she's a therapist, a licensed therapist, so

good experience around me riding and that was really really happy, i love horses and nature, which is the greatest thing i love and it has made me so happy and so relaxed that it was an unforgettable experience <laughter>, to be caring, i don't judge, i never judge that i'm never crazy, i'll never get mad at anyone else, just like my family you know, but, yeah just very nice caring and so

of you racing sometimes it's going to be flashbacks of bad memories, only you know., thinking too much <laughter>, um, i don't know, i just think, um.., stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what solves it <laughter>, i'm just trying to stay positive, i'm trying to think like okay, but you know, one day it's gonna get better., um , i'm just

really depressed it doesn't make me feel good at all i get very uh it's just really bad if i don't sleep yes, yeah, that's good., thank you., yes, i was diagnosed three years ago., i just didn't know what was going on, then i realized that they diagnosed that and.., i was how okay that's the problem and i just wanted to help because it's just when your mind is after you, like it's just terrible if your mind is in control of you so, yeah, that's good., yeah, it's hard., yeah, yeah, i definitely always thought i had a problem, i always thought something was really wrong., i always like a little nervous around people, as if i could never really look someone in the eyes, because i'm just as nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i, to have sweat, if i were in the situation that reminded me of the situation, how i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings these flashbacks yes, oh, i felt good, i got more out every day, i'm trying, um, i guess going keeps my mind from my p t s d symptoms, so i'm trying to walk more that helps, thank you., yeah, i'm depressed., around it helps yes it really helps me a lot around i haven't got one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's some kind of confusion, but yes it really helps me, i noticed that i had less flashbacks and.., i was more relaxed, i guess, and.., yeah, all you know is that you're trying to keep more busy, yeah, it helps., the last time i felt really happy about, i guess.., i don't know today, because i mean, i'm glad to be part of this laughter ., um highly proud of uh, good <sigh>um, i'm trying to think about what i'm most proud of., i , think i'm very proud of how the fact that i'm able to you don't know how well i mean most people i know that they deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i really like, you know, a person who can see that i have a problem and i need help, but many of the people i know they're not on medication are untreated and.., they just don't want to get help and i'm glad to get help because i don't want to feel that way and i want to get help for the problem instead of doing that, oh, god, there's a lot i regret yes there's a lot around, i regret that you know that drug abuse you know, but that's part of you know that p t s d i regret about, many uh mistakes you know relationships things like that, i would have told myself., um, i guess the advice i would have given myself was , trying to keep my mind more relaxed, i guess, yeah, that's good., um, well, i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people always say how i smile a lot, but to smile i think it hides somehow like what's on the inside, but you know i'm pretty depressed you know, but, i'm just trying to keep smiling and i always like to give a hand to help and people feel better, for fun i like going to the mall that's a lot of fun, i like going to the mall, i like going out with my grandma, we go places to go shopping i love shopping and i like to

346,"yes, i'm fine., here in los engeles, there are a lot of things to do i love the beach, i love that i love that it's sunny all the time, to the crowd of people, um , this is really the crowd of people, just a little., i just go to new places and discover new things, i was in new york recently, i was there for about three months, um, and it was extremely boring that i went to western new york., it was extremely snowy and.., i wasn't in a position where i didn't have a car, so i couldn't go very many places and i was in a small town, so, um.., i don't know., it was nice for what i got to see, but really, it wasn't really much for him <laughter>, yeah, that's good., um , i'm both an introverter and an extroverter., um , i really enjoy doing things alone, um , i've spent a lot of my own around my preferences and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though i have a lot of friends, and when i go out, i tend to meet a lot of people, but i also enjoy being a lot of myself., um , probably outgoing creative, um , aged, to have fun trustworthy, um , i've studied language around, and physics, and, mathematics, no, i'm not., i'm actually.., i'm trying to be an actress., it was something i fell into when i was a teenager, , and i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it in years., so i figured why i didn't just come back to california and could try so well, something i really like to do, i just got picked up by an agent., so as an adult, i haven't done anything yet, but.., i hope,, in the hope that it will be fruitful, um , i really didn't have too many., um , i guess my sister did really well., um , my friend, he's a, he's a very positive person., um , but.., really i haven't had too many positive influences, um , i'm close, i mean, we're hanging out, i'm not telling them everything., you're kind of judgmental., but.., except i mean, i mean, we're hanging out, i mean, i see her every day, um , oh, my god!, um , it's kind of hard for me to relax, i mean, i'm trying to watch t v, um, and i'm reading, a lot.., that's probably about me reading that i sleep a lot <laughter> i'm a little depressed, so to, yeah, it's kind of , like i said, it's really hard for me to relax, um , it's not that., i tend to think a lot, about the things that emphasize me, i've been through a lot of things, so.., i don't sleep very well at night, and when i fall asleep, i wake up all night, usually with some kind of anxiety attack., um , i dream a lot about the stuff that uh has, influenced me over the years., you usually know how i dream about something that stressed me out and then i wake up and my chest will hurt, um , or just i just can't sleep all night because i think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to sleep, but i.. <sigh>, i just don't know that i feel like this is a vulnerable place for me., because of everything that happened to me., so, um.., so i sleep is just not really something i do well, um , tired, i'm.., i'm moody, i'm very sensitive, um , i'm just negative <ne> a negative person, um, i'm really not., i'm like < l> judgment is not me either, i'm just not a nice person to be here, um , i'm trying to read a lot of time i'm trying to go out and force myself to do things, just to keep myself in touch, so i just sit around and stay on the fact that i can't sleep and i try to make myself as exhausted as possible, to run around and do things, so , it's difficult., i like a part of me that doesn't want to., i don't really want to go out and do things that i have to force myself to do when i have appointments., i make appointments to like for auditions or around, also to do that, i tend to uh, only not, as in the last minute i will try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself anyway, yes, i was diagnosed for two cases., to diagnose i was diagnosed <dia> about three years ago three and a half years ago, and then i was diagnosed again around august, um , the first time it was.., i just didn't sleep because i didn't sleep., and the uh just the stress <st> of incredible stress, um , and then the second time it was a uh again i started sleeping with the not around and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me around, and i just couldn't stand it anymore, so i thought.., i became too gloomy i became like, don't think life was worth it and i that i just had to see someone before something escalated, yeah, that's good., it was, i no <n> not, one of the reasons i went to new york was to try, get out of my surroundings, um, and uh, and that seemed to help a lot, um , and out here i was just the advisors i just didn't really seem to help me much, um, they're just.., they seemed to give me a lot of medication and i don't think that's what i needed, um , yeah, so.., yeah, that's good., <sigh>stressed uh uh lately i was really sad and i don't know why, um , but as i said, i tried to fight this by.., keep me busy, um , in fact,, i'm kind of, a few days ago, i was really really happy and i was really happy, but then i went back to, you know you're going back to the miserable feeling, so, um , well, i realized, i got up in the morning, i really got a good night of sleep, and, i realized i was really happy., because i've been through a lot in my life and i have someone in my life who really loves me and someone who's finally there for me, and uh, you know, he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just very grateful for the, and that made me really happy, um , yeah, that's good., thank you very much <laughter>, oh, god, what are you doing?, um , i've had so many years of just, just bad a lot bad, that it was there a long time ago, since i'm proud of everything, i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through, around my <m> a smaller person i guess would have, got rid of himself a long time ago, but even if i'm really depressed and feel dark and i just feel miserable about many things, there must be a silver lining., so , so, yeah, i mean, i think that's what i'm proud of., i'm still trying to be a good person to try not to be negative to other people, and, and truthfully and i still have to drive inside me, yeah, that's good., so much.., my last marriage, don't come out if i should have, um , and uh just, i regret a lot, <sigh>, the situation that would have a red flag.., you know, some things just don't work., and, no matter how much you try, no matter how much you put in it., i'd tell myself to.., that it is not selfish, let go of a bad situation, and not everyone can be helped, so sometimes you only have to live for yourself and help yourself, , had i known that then i had known that, then i would probably have done better in life, so , yeah, that's good., <sigh>, um, people who, when people fall on me because of my mistakes, that i've done that i have things i've done in my past that people are still alive when i'm trying to forgive myself., people who are mean to other people, uh, people who talk badly about people behind their backs, people who are untrustworthy, um, only anyone looking for the little guy, um , you know people who don't care about the environment or animals, um , i think everyone should be as good as possible., and it's discouraging and it just makes me so angry that people just can't be people who don't let people live, who try to make everyone feel as negative and as bad as they do, and uh i that makes me angry, <laughter> i unraveled <laughter>, yeah, i tend to vent and then uh, and then it's usually over, i'm not trying to mouth bad people, i'm just trying to talk it through until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore, mm, i'm not trying to get angry, because i have a really bad temper, and it's, and it can be out of hand so around, what i do is i <laughter> something makes me so angry i tend to go and take a nap, to <laughter> if i'm not in this situation where i can just take a nap, i usually just walk away from the situation and try to clean up my mind, and come back to him, um , it was a few days ago, it was actually with my mother, it was about, actually, she thought that i had taken a shirt from her, and around her cried out, and cried to me, and round about,, i was tired, i was late., i started screaming <a> back to her you know, because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty, and you <yo> <sigh>, it goes back to my past, you know, when i was younger and you know i didn't care that you knew people's things and i just kind of took and did what i wanted and i'm not that far from that person, it hurt me, so i got angry and i and i started screaming and fighting., mm kind of petty and stupid, but, at the time when it seemed, it seemed uh, viable, um , hmm, one of my most memorable experiences, um , god, i've had so many.., maybe, it was.., i don't know., um , it was, it's probably due to, graduated from pharmacy school, i felt pretty great, i didn't know if i did., uh very good or not uh and i always ended up like on my last test results i always landed <get> like ninety eight percent, and, i don't know., i actually had no confidence that i had done well at school and i didn't even know how to get the grades i got, so that was a really great achievement for me., and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah, yeah, that's good., um , i'm reliable., um , i um , i'm talented., for the, i'm a good listener, um , i'm always here to help people., um , i always try to do the right thing, um , sometimes i forget that i have some good qualities, but, um , and only, i don't know., everywhere i try to be you know how good and the best person i can be for other people and myself, um , yeah, that's good., um , go to comedy shows, um , just.., to have moments in which you just laugh with people, um , sometimes just reading brings me into a good mood, uh , i don't know., maybe it's time., uh huh , all right., thank you., see you.",23

to this question., no, no, yes, um , well officially october of last year, but i think i'm longer depressed than that, but officially october of last year, um , actually i was treated uh for other medical problems and, um, my depression was so remarkable for the doctors, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., um , well, i've never been suicidal, but just to just in i i've just often thought about, eh, that i don't have much reason to live i thought i had a purpose and stuff, but, i don't have anyone in my life., who i think takes care of me enough uh, that i was really <rea> when i was even dead, uh so, i kind of lost myself., and around that was once enough, that i was around enough to uh, you know you have purpuse in my life, but.., i've lost some of it., motivation <motiv> yeah, well, i'm trying to pull it together, i'm trying to, <sigh> get a feeling back from me, i get inspired again and again, but overall i don't seem to make much progress., yeah, that's good., i wouldn't really call it therapy, i don't have a therapist per se, i have a therapist., a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me, and no one really talk about psychosocial questions, for the, uh huh , did you say it was annoying?, eh , all right., and yes., to overwhelmed busy around, i'm just trying to stay alive and watch over everything., no, uh , it's easy if i can't., yeah, if i have a chance to fall asleep, i don't have a problem with that., more, distracted and.., more, uh lousy i guess the word is, whatever, uh if i had a best friend around <sigh>, i don't know about <sigh>, he may have many positive adjectives before, but now only you know, just uh, some people say i should be proud because i survive a hard time or some people think that uh, i'm a loser., <laughter> like this, um, i don't know, maybe around, a survivor, uh persistently, well, i've always been proud of my career and, i give back people who give back to society because i was given., it felt like around <sigh>, so i'm just proud of uh, i don't have much pride anymore, to be honest., i don't know., <laughter> psychology, and, good at first, um not really in itself, although my current career includes a lot of uh, psychology a lot of, i don't know what i'm saying., it's a part of it, but it's not the center of it., well, i guess if my career still goes, i'm in care, but.., i've been sick lately and with depression and other health problems i, uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income, and i start the process because i don't work, very, i mean, i had my dream jobs., i had my dream jobs that i didn't have., i don't know what the future will be like, uh, work, but, um.., something i suppose to work with people again, health uh help in any way, um, no, but lately with the depression more often, i've always said that i've never regretted anything because i'd make the best decision for all things ahead of me, but.., i just wish there were times when.., the decisions i would have been, < slaughter>, were better because some decisions i apparently made or were made for me made my world somehow fucked up, for lack of a better word shit, what i don't understand, <sigh>, to be strong to believe in myself, to remember that i've survived a lot of things, and i'm going to survive that too, to get up and move me, to < sigh>, to have confidence, faith, to <sigh>, i just kicked my ass with murphy's law, as much as you know, i just uh, it seems like i've been trying to make my world better, i'm getting depressed again and again., so, it's almost like i'm, i don't want to give up, but every time i try to move forward, i get knocked back and it gets exhausting, and i have no support system really no one, not really, <sigh>, um , loyal, um, working hard, um , reliable, um , be able to , well, at least i used to be, uh , intelligent, contemplative around eh uh, deep, not a superficial person around, yeah, i guess that's some of them., many years ago, i used to have a lot of trust., pretty dynamic person i used to be people, said <wou> <s> used to say that i was the centered person they knew, and i used to, people help and i'm in their shoes now and i don't seem to be able to help myself, <sigh>, <sigh>, i can't think of anything., right now., i can't think of anything right now., i don't make much fun anymore, but i always go to movies and entertainment venues and travel, go to dinner with friends doing things around, but lately i don't really have any persecutions, a good day a happy day a funny day for me is a day without anything to go wrong, in principle, < slaughter>, mhm, yeah, that's good., see you.",5
350,"yes, i'm fine, thank you., original i'm from good i was born in mississippi so i'm from golfport mississippi, yes, i had no choice, i was a child that i moved here with my parents., < slaughter>, when i was two years old, yes, i was a toddler, yes i like to travel and i travel a lot, to be in new environments and new people uh different things, <cough>, well, one of my favorite trips was the visit of africa, in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical help to the people, a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved, so i went with her and it went from there, so i don't know that i made the decision that way, i'm glad i did what i'll never forget., < slaughter>, i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students, currently not no, now at the moment i to tutor privately for a private tutoring company and look to work back in the classroom as a teacher, mhm, wow, all that uh combined teaching travel and writing would be a dream job for me so, yes, everything that combines these three elements, so the teaching has the next result that, um , occasionally yes <laughter>, <freezes the neck>, i don't know, i think compared to others who have said as outgoing and and a lot of people i seem reserved or somehow introverted i don't know, mm, all right., i don't know that i read, i just started meditating., mm try to breathe and soothe <laughter>, yeah, that's good., some things that really drive me crazy, um , mistreatment of children, child abuse, try to figure out what usually bugs me and then you go from there uh when i can, control not annoying as ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoying, so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not get annoyed if i can help it all, oh i'm okay i can totally <to> when controlling my temperament i think so i don't have any yeah, the last time i had a fight with someone, was, i don't know, maybe a few days ago and it was about, it was about a smell they had on their clothes, but i thought smelled of perfume and they said it didn't do so <laughter>, yeah, that's good., < slaughter>, that's cool., i think i'm very close to my family, we're a pretty close family conversation every day to see us almost every day., there were a lot of positive re influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mom were all positive influences, well, i look, i see, i clear throat, i look at my aunt, i think she's positive, i look at her,, because we obviously grew up with very similar backgrounds, came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and it is very successful, despite the kind of things we have been through as children., and she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom has overcome so many obstacles uh she's had some challenges with her health but she's still trying to be optimistic and she's still trying to, they know to overcome these things and only our lives despite some physical barriers that they might have, so that i can become people who are able to, they know not to allow their current situation to dictate their future, because everything is possible, no i didn't, no, i've been, well, i was diagnosed to, within the last year and uh then last again in the last three months, all right., afraid and just not knowing what to do with some of the things i felt, and not knowing about, you know why i couldn't stop feeling how i felt, there were many symptoms., um, you know, mostly i've gained a lot., i couldn't sleep much., and then i could sometimes sleep too much <laughter> around, sometimes i was sad., how i wanted to cry very much, i felt good., i don't know that every day is different., i mean, today i feel good, but as i said, everything has been different lately i have felt to be more than i can be involved in my own life and how i want, out and do more things, um , no no it's no no i haven't , not different from, before what i experienced before, no , mm, good mm i got around, i guess psychotherapy and.., i don't know that much has happened, i moved to take care of my grandmother for a while., more involved in the care of other people instead of me for a while, sometimes, i know., yes, it is., it's kind of difficult, i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep, i'm sure it's just i don't know what it is anymore because i know you, < sniffle> normally it's about thoughts running continuous thoughts through my mind, that either stop me or make it hard for me to go to sleep uh or make it hard for me to sleep, mhm, to journal sometimes uh that could help if i write down some things and it helps out that, otherwise i don't know that i haven't found any really good ways to cope, it, tired <laughter>, yeah, mostly uh tired around, kind of confused, i don't know that i usually feel happy, it's just.., the last time i felt really happy i was thinking about the holidays, uh, i don't know, i guess that just around uh family and friends just the christmas time i think in general this is just a happy time for me, and seeing people i haven't seen in a while., that's it., how my best friend would probably describe me as around, quiet sometimes cautious talky sometimes around persistent, i don't know that many of my friends say that they're looking to me for some of my accomplishments and, they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i am caring and compassionate, or, to just talk to around, that i put her to one of <o> me like a sister for her, < slaughter>, i'm sure i regret things., rightly, relax and be yourself and just keep going and it sounds clich and i don't want to sound like that, but it's true, it's just about you having to learn how to feel and relax with you and just know not to compare yourself with other people, because what someone else does or where they may be in their lives at a certain time is not necessarily where you, you should be or what you should do at this time does not mean that you are less competent or less able to do it, it just means that everyone has their way and everyone has their way., their time and their development, as they get to things, i would say to myself ten years ago, only, believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and not be, yeah, that's good., to really enjoyed working with to good, all right., a science project < laughter> with around my younger uh relatives my cousins we have a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we it was a ball, i'm the first one to attend college in my family., and then go to college and come back to the community where i uh uh went to school and then teach in this community and volunteer work in this community and help around youth or children coming from the same background that i came from so, i'm very proud to be able to, have the opportunity to improve and improve me and then come back and, helping others to improve and improve themselves, goodbye.",11
351,"yes, empty the throat , all right., to new york, to look for a job in the music industry, uh yes, i'm self employed., to become a music producer, it's pretty hard that there's a lot of competition <laughter>, um, to look for a job, um, if.., about a year ago last february, it was quite difficult east coast is much different than the west coast, i think i've been there twice last year., no, i'm more of a creature of habit, um, yeah., sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd, so it's better to be quieter sometimes and see everything instead of knowing that you're going in and pursuing things actively., um, <laughter> probably uh listen to music and spend time with my dogs, <freezes the neck>, likely to be insensitive to humans around, not very nice to me or.., to see or to see injustices, i think that's it, <laughter>, um, pretty good., you know sometimes <so>, um, probably a few days ago around one of my friends said that she said a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about it, yes, it does <laughter>, pretty close, my best friend, so.., oh, just one of my friends, um, i'm kind of quiet about it, and when a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when i usually overreact, it's pretty hard to find out more about the person that i somehow withdraw and actively engage in myself instead of getting it to the point where it's like around it comes to a point where it blows out of the relationship, um, to probably spend time with my family, in new york, very close, um, my sister and my brother, i don't know they're just great people., and i love her very much and, they're very similar to me, so i feel like i have people who understand me., um, likely, um, i guess loyally.., sensitive to <laughter>, i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a difficult question <laughter>, no, none <free throat>, yes, god, i think probably nineteen ninety seven so long ago, um, i just went through this time i just went through a lot of problems and i felt insecure to myself so that i end up going to the doctor to get some medication and therapy and so, um not at the moment i have been about six months ago, i just thought the therapist wasn't really helping me. i thought we were talking about the same things over and over again., she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time, so i just knew it was a change, it's okay <laughter>, yes, i do., when i feel connected to a therapist and when i feel like it's a great way for me to talk about what i'm going through., um, i'm better at describing my feelings and feelings, i think the biggest thing is to, when i'm in situations, i can see how i react in a way, and i take a step back and see how i can usually almost react in a way., i also tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and somehow bury them and make them feel really bad about myself., so it's nice to talk to someone who doesn't judge, who doesn't really tell me, as you know, that they tell me it's o okay, basically <free throat>, um, to be hopeless all the time, don't you know enough energy to do things i like i had a little concentration problems, um, with strange disturbing thoughts sometimes just in my mind and only overall just feeling a little lousy about life, um, sometimes they're like random moments when there's something like a problem with my interpersonal life or something like that, or when i even see something on tv sometimes that affects me, to listen to music or distract me to try, as my therapist told me the longest, to log., to record things, empty the throat , it was a hard transition to come here, so uh good to be here, so to be half and half in order and not to be all right., i have the feeling that i've been a little more withdrawn lately, but that's what it is., around < clears throat> on some days it is great, on some days it has not been a little more difficult recently., i don't know why i have so many thoughts about my mind at night <empty throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite often during the night <empty throat>, smokes the throat very groggy in the morning , it's like i'm yawning a lot during the day and my friends are always so oh why yawn you are so uninterested in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not like that at all <laughter>, probably christmas time when i was with my family, just really happy and.., feeling that everything in my life was all right, with a good feeling of how i was present at this moment with myself, um, maybe you know., let's see, that's a difficult question., i think probably, i can read people well sometimes, and.., uh i like to say uh i'm good at being a good friend to people being a good family member uh, i'm a hard worker when i have a job, so <laughter>, um, to be sure that i mean, it's life, so there's, of course, regret about, one that comes to mind is the desire that i don't eat so much so that i can be much more healthy <laughter>, um, do not take things so seriously <laughter> to enjoy being teeny and to, i think that's it <laughter>, um, i don't know., that's a good question., probably to my previous job and my occupation i have worked really well with children around, so i did a great job that i was a researcher., to go to a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out, for about six years, i.e. seven years, yes, it was fantastic, um, i was really kind of like, reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat>, so uh, and then i went to work in a.., psychiatry and research with them to deal with drugs and depression and such things, it found like a good niche for me, <laughter> okay, no problem <laughter>, goodbye <laughter>",14
352,"yes, i do it pretty well <laughter>, i'm from oklahoma., mhm, yup oklahoma city, uh the weather is great i love it near the ocean and palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter>, it was pretty easy, there are a few differences it is a huge city compared to where i'm out of so traffic is definitely an adaptation for me <laughter>, i just wanted to live in california. i hate being locked up in oklahoma. i just wanted to go to the west coast near the ocean., i studied psychology and minor art, no, not right now., i think i misunderstood your question, but i'm not working on my degree yet, but i'm working on psychology., my dream job oh, i don't really know, i think i just want to help people, but i can and um, i like to work with people in the field of psychology, so i think i might already have my dream job <laughter>, to relax i like to read or watch movies around i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends, things that really drive me crazy.. probably injustice to other people, people who are abused or abused and people who are lied and deceived, including myself, i hate to be lied to <laughter>, when i'm upset uh depends on the situation, but, i'm just trying, how to count to ten and take a deep breath and let my emotions react to me in a negative way, so i'm just trying to calm down before i say anything, um, it depends again on the situation and how i'm angry at around most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it, but sometimes i think like, like most people i turn to the people i'm closest to times and and these moments i'm not so good at controlling it, when was the last time i had a fight with someone?, it was probably with my parents., i've been having some problems with the car lately and, i'm also slow with money, so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly, but i'm sure we probably fought over the fact that, i know that i have to take care of my own <laughter> things like car problems., i'm very close to my family, they're still in oklahoma, but i'm talking to them on the phone all the time, oh definitely i mean, my mom, i think she's probably the person i'm closest to and she's just, she's a great role model, she's a wonderful person and she's very diligent and very selfless and i just want to be like her., oh, probably the time i went bungee jump over the nile river in uganda, i still have flashbacks from this moment, just falling free, it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy, so it was a funny time <laughter>, yes, well, i've travelled a lot these days, i'm not travelling that much anymore, but i've been working for a cruise line around norwegian cruise line and so i'd go, travel with them all the time and then i also have an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped in different third countries it was really cool, uh i love to go to different places, see new places and meet all different types of people around, because it is easy to simply be included in your own little bubble that you forget that there is a huge world and there is, all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet these types of people and just see the, diversity and the terrain of the earth also and the way the earth looks in different places is cool, no, i didn't serve in the military <laughter>, yes, no, i've never been formally diagnosed, although i'd say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression just after studying it a lot in psychology, during the years i've been, i'm probably ninety nine percent sure i've struggled with depression from time to time, so yeah, lately it's been pretty easy, but over the years i've definitely had a lot of problems with insomnia around just like either not being able to fall asleep, or just as constantly waking up all night and so now i'm not really experiencing too much of it, but in the past it's definitely an ongoing topic for me, i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely important to me i think maybe more than a lot of people i like need good sleep to work, i feel really good., in the last few months, i've been unemployed after i got out of here and, this was really tough around and i just offered my job around just like last week, so i definitely think i've gone through, a lot of crap and just a lot of depression, but it's like i've picked up a lot of it because i don't have that pressure anymore, how will i end up hitting this city really expensive and i don't have a job and, so i feel much more relieved than i had the feeling that's good <laughter>, i mean, just like i said last week, or so i've become a lot more., positive i was kind of like a feeling like a hermit in a way it's just hard to be like in a new city and not really know too many people and, of course, as i said, not having a job leads to, type of, like in your own bowl i think, and that was kind of like it was like it was like it was like for me and just since i got the job offered i just got so much more, trust and like positivity that things start to train for me, which is good <laughter>, oh, it was probably a few days ago actually i was going around, i went to explore a part of the south bay that i hadn't really been before and, it was i just wanted to go on a jogging along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and, it was just beautiful and then i went for a ride of this kind like cliff, where there is beautiful scenery that i've never seen before and i just, how overwhelmed was how beautiful it was and i was just like oh i can't believe i can live here, so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter>, my best friend would probably say that i am very daring and, bold and fearless about, that i am unique, and artistic, and i wouldn't suspect that she would probably say that i'm a non conformist, i don't really think the way many people do and i question everything that can be a good or bad thing, but yeah < laugh>, um , likely, just like, the fact that i really try to live my life with no regrets and just try to make a very, exciting life in a way and i think that especially since i finished college and travel as i have and, i've tried to move all the different places from myself, so i just think the fact that i'm not really afraid that i'm not letting things hold back i just want something or if i want to do something, i can just do it and, i think in a way i like that about me and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do what i want, even though it's hard i'm still proud that i've overcome a lot of these fights, oh, there's like little things i regret all my life, but there's nothing really important, because i think pretty much everything i've done, i've learned whether it's good or bad so, i wouldn't change anything., oh,, i'd say i'd tell myself when i was a kid that i, should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything someone says stop me from believing that anything is possible because, um, i guess when i grew up to be an adult, i really saw and started to believe that really everything is possible and if you really want something, you can go after it and you can get it, so i would just, tell me never to give up and just always believe that you can do whatever you want., oh , let's see, that's kind of tough <laughter>, um, i guess,, i recently went home for christmas back to oklahoma and to see some of my friends from college i hadn't seen in some of them i hadn't seen how since, i graduated so much as four years ago., it was really great, just going out with them and we went to dinner and we went out later and had only a good night and it was really really fun, cool, you're welcome., see you.",10
353,"yes, i'm fine., to pennsylvania, mhm, well, i was in boston a few years ago and then i moved here about three and a half years ago, but around i was just not satisfied with the quality of my life, to maybe once or twice last year i only returned once, one year, um, in any case safer and to definitely a, well, i just miss it because i have a lot of family back there, but l a is okay i mean everyone loves the climate here, um , not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a friend with whom i've been together for three years so that helps him to be from here, but to make it definitely took a bit of adjustment, no, to promote communication, no, i'm actually working right now, i'm not working right now., i want to be an osteopathic doctor, so basically against western medicine an osteopathic doctor is someone who, helps someone with the symptoms and not only treats the symptoms, but treats them as an entire person, so they look at diet, diet exercise, just a variety of things to really get someone to live <t>, a healthier life versus drugs or things that are commonly prescribed in western medicine today, well, one of the big things was when i got out of here to be exposed to the degree i'd never heard of living on the east coast., sometimes, well, i'm very special about the people i like to surround myself with around and, i don't like being with many people, i mean, i like small intimate groups, and i don't like being in larger or larger groups., um, when people do not take into account other people's feelings, usually, try to take a walk when i am very irritated, i'm usually really good, it really takes a lot of time for me to flood and scream or get upset., let's see., uh mm, i was with my lawyer and it was about his treatment of my case., yeah, it was him, uh, they're i don't know, i think they're just a little mediocre, they're not the best lawyers., i have no idea <laughter>, i'm very trustworthy, i'm loyal., i am very interested so i like to try to help other people, um, and i'm always trying to cheer people up, so i think that's a few of them., no, yes, a few months ago about in the last six months, to me was, experience, mental problems that i never really came from paranoia and fear and i knew it wasn't, um, i knew it wasn't me that i couldn't get over it alone., much better i did a lot of yoga and meditation to somehow see things from a different perspective, or other <ano> not per <pe> per view, but a different view and around, this has helped, but there are definitely times when i return to thinking about the event especially because the event caused that i no longer work, um , i think i know i'm having trouble being in public. i'm still dealing with fear and paranoia., to such a lot of times during the day is when it happened, so i'm not so comfortable to go during the day i tend to go into the mornings and evenings, i don't like going to places where there's only one way in and one way out., um, well, i've been trying gradually to raise how much i'm out there to, and i usually just deep breathing around i do a lot of breathing exercises and, i'm just trying to say that basically what i think or what's wrong with me is not real and that, i'm just trying <laughter> i'm just trying to go into these places more gradually much better since uh the last few months, but before i stayed a lot pretty much at home, um , it was good to hear someone's feedback, but.., i have the feeling that i have got more help in my inner conversation, with just one kind of sitting with me and journaling, i know., to <sigh>, well, i feel more like myself, which is a tremendous improvement around, and i'm more, carefully and guarded in any way over my thoughts, um, and also about my decisions, i'm not like this, i'm not so oh you know i'm just gonna do this and i'm not really thinking about the consequences of other things i want in my life, it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now around the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke up maybe two or three times and would be awake for a few hours, but now i'm sleeping through the night again, i feel like groggy <sigh>, i feel foggy and out of her, and little depressed, mm, it's.., i think it's been a while., um, work <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic around, spending time with my family, um, yes, just being outside, enjoying nature, read, around very close, what's that?, um, , um, well, my parents, because they were always very supportive and loving., gives me feedback about my decisions or what i decide to do, but allows me to make my own decisions in life and then, my sisters were just getting very close to you know just always check with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they're always around, looking for me and only with me and then my friend with this incident that happened, he was very, uh usually supportive with just let me talk and work my kind of things and understanding when i feel and don't want to go out in public and, and to be aware that it is not so easy for me to do something like a grocery store, or, to do errands without a lot of fear, i'm very proud of, the work i've done to the people i've helped., maybe that i took this job where i was attacked at <laughter>, that's it., go to retail in insecure environment, don't listen to my stomach, um , what advice would i give, what, uh, to, ruthlessly pursue your dreams, that it is not something like too late or runs out of time and, and to enjoy every moment of your life takes nothing but self evident, um , let's see., uh.., cook well i really enjoy i enjoy cooking around, so i made a few roasted vegetables just every time i cook i just really enjoy it around we have a garden so, we had greens that came and around some chilies, and cauliflower so easy with preparation that, for <f>um, for my friend and i, mhm, bye, thank you.",11
354,"yeah, i'm fine with that., pretty good to do, little tired, i'm from los closeles, the weather and the sport, i can't find jobs right now., i know, uh, not really., i studied architecture and chicano studies and a little history, uh, since <si> i was <wa> little <li> because i was small, i liked to draw and then i like to learn about history, i try to work and go to school, i try to reach my goal and get my degree., play in n f l, what was that?, i don't know what that is., eat or sleep, people who don't make them, go away, um, pretty good., like three days ago a few days ago about some family problems, to be sure, well, um.., likes to train football and ride a bike, um, on the way to this u c l a, i felt great as if i was really doing something with myself, my parents, how they fight < strang> they when they fight, they still manage to put through what they want, and, i'm pretty close., uh, quiet, about my height and strength, mm no, it's pretty hard., uh, i come home too late and i'm usually for like fifteen to like eighteen hours during the day so by the time i come home i'm really not even so tired to sleep, yeah, that's good., uh, when i don't sleep well i get to wake up grumpy or like not in the mood to do things, mm, just like, under pressure a little, not so hard, i just.., stress pretty much, sometimes, only i really don't like to work, but i have to, um, a little, for example , it's not that i'm not a little more violent., but only one side <s> just a side effect of not playing football for a while, music, eating or training, um, i don't know., raising my son and while i was still in high school, no, patience, watch your son grow, i have a five and a half year old boy., i don't just see him this weekend., pretty close, destroyed, they are, they are so progressive with everything that it does, like their grandparents, feel like dinosaurs while they are already born and they already know how to use everything around their house, i can't treat her like kids anymore., they treat them pretty much like adults sometimes it works some it doesn't do it really doesn't work, no, should have stayed on only one path, follow my dreams probably like or just follow what i wanted to do, and so is it., a few months ago, i played football and played for a junior college., we made it to the championship bowl, which was probably the happiest i was in a while, good, thank you., see you.",18
355,"yes, all right., i was born in uh los angeles california, the weather and, the fact that uh people aren't as intrusive as on the east coast, uh, only the uh traffic and the, the smoggy weather, i used to be unemployed, so i rarely go anywhere., i have a b s in uh business with a uh computer uh, option, i thought that the only place where i had a job with a business <bu> business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods, so i took that business computer methods option, oh, i'd probably be like.., a professional sports player or an actor something you like to do, i like it uh, cycling i like to see sporting events, now i can't afford to go to them, so i'm pretty much looking at t v, i like to travel, but as i say, i don't have any money for it anymore., that's all right., people who are chicken heads get their noses in other people's business, even if they're just strangers you expect from a family member., or a friend, but you know, especially with the internet that feeds a lot of it now we know what orwell related to when he spoke of great brother in nineteen eighty four, i don't do much., much different than i usually do, uh and i had lots of temper outbursts, uh , i fight with my aunt, and it was because it was basically, making leading statements to lure me into a trap, to say something about a relative, and it made me very angry, i'm kind of on the road with my parents., i'm kind of the black sheep., oh, i mean, my mom did the most to help me., she's done a lot., you know more than anyone else by far., well, i mean, she's just, i remember a time when i went in like thirteen with a friend of mine to see the crosby stills nash and young concert in the forum, and she has seven children, and she picked me up at the sizzlers' place opposite the forum at eleven o'clock at night, and i couldn't imagine,, with everything she had to do the day she agreed to do, but she did., oh probably uh, on the cape at the end of the peninsula uh baja there are cabo san lucas, or take <ta> the photographing of the bridal wedge falls in yosemit, uh it was probably the two most majestic sights i've ever seen, it was when i could afford to travel, no, no, i was, diagnosis with depression after a hospital visit in april of two thousand eleven, and uh i took a few lexapro but i stayed after a day i didn't want to do it anymore, no, because i didn't feel it was helpful, i feel that i was becoming a zombie, yeah, that's good., depressed about not having a job for over two years i lost my job in october two thousand and ten and except for, day you know jobs like this that i'm lucky, only you know daily things focus groups like that i haven't worked, thank you., especially when you are fifty six years old, good mm, uh just uh it just that i think the general feeling of hopelessness, i get a lot on my bike and go or drive only four hours a day divided about two hours, yeah, well, to get something, very simple, because now i'm old, when i was young, i couldn't sleep more than six < s> four six hours a night, because i'm restless, no, but now that i'm old, i sleep much easier, i pray before i go to sleep, and that's when i don't have any trouble sleeping, i just pray, recite various prayers like the prayer of the lord's hail mary stuff so and i am able to fall to sleep, i don't know, probably uh, can't have specific memories, of that you know that it was when i had to spend money i know that and if i had to have a job to spend money, so it was probably, 15 years ago, all right., i didn't enjoy anything i did last week., made 75 dollars on a job with the county basically it was an emergency preparation exercise they ran for their staff and they recruited people to play, who are basically the relatives of people who are in a, case uh bombing in the parenthesis center and we know that the asked questions signed you know that they give them the information i miss, you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county, and basically went through a routine in downtown l a, not hard it was just uh, just a routine that we had to follow, we had to pretend that we were actually, lacked someone and had to give the peculiarities of their properties height weight etcetera, i don't have a best friend., uh , i'm very bright., i'm a, perfectionist at my work, i'd say that's it., i got a business degree and i've never been a motivated person i went to school i went to, two state universities and two, i think that was probably the most important post < con> post that i made to my, you know about my self esteem that you could say, so i had something to hang on the wall., yeah, i'm sorry you know, displace family members, i would have.., basically was not so impetuous and left thinking jobs < think> thinking that, you know, i could still get one and not you know it, i could probably work at one of the employers i've worked for the moment, they added places, but i burned bridges there, so that's not possible., thank you., hasta luego",10
356,"yes, all right., from here anyway from alhambra, the weather is really nice and everything is very familiar, uh sometimes there's too much traffic jam on the roads too much traffic, i studied art and photography, it wasn't so much a decision that i kept noticing that i was very interested in it., yes, i'm a photographer., mhm, oh, i suppose, uh, um, run a family portrait studio or any other type of photography business, uh no i'm also an apartment manager it keeps me tied, it's fair that it's not the best because it's an apartment manager., i have a free rent, but i have to stay., there's a lot, so , that part does the free rental part is very good, oh, god!, my most memorable experience, that's hard to say, um , all right., i mean, there are good and bad unforgettable experiences, oh, well, i guess some s like sports success when i was in high school, there were some of the things i was happy about, and, some works of art i made were unforgettable, and, some bad things would be the death of my father, you know, but these are very memorable not good though, uh , well, my parents and my i have a lot of brothers and sisters, uh so that my family, uh pretty close, but most of them live around l a, there are a few who come from far <f>, away <di> uh away my brother lives in new york and, my other brother lives in maui <free throat>, mhm, oh, mostly very talented, <ss> just to get more involved in the technology than maybe i was, or i am and they are about, i think they're more of a hive ghost than when i grew up, looks like they're all entangled in social media., go for a walk or, watching tv, or play with my computer, and uh, uh, good., there are some <so> some, uh , there's a kind of uh, injustices that do not happen, no big deals, but for example our parking situation deteriorated with some new district parking, that's kind of disturbing and the city doesn't seem to want to, uh make any exceptions or change some rules, and also uh some unfair things sometimes happen at work, the riots are <ups>, uh, who're annoying, nope., i worked for <f> at school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this past weekend and when we arrived at the site, people on the premises said we couldn't do all our gear and scenery and things in the place where we were assigned to do it, that we were going outside, and then get an ok to go in because we weren't prepared outside, nor even said in advance that we should be outside, it delayed our setup time and that wouldn't have bothered me, except that on monday morning the school called our boss and complained., that we set up too late when they told us, to wait for them and we told them we would delay when we wait and we still have a complaint, so this part is annoying and, and our work doesn't support those in the office they need to please the school to keep the account., uh often, when something like that happens, it means that they won't send you to work at this school again, which would translate into less pay hours for the photographers who were in this job, yeah, that's how they do things., so that this is disturbing, uh most of the time i dust from my resume <laughter> and look for other situations that, this could be better, um , yeah, that's good., uh pretty good <sigh> i usually , i could the moment i don't really lose it, but later i could.., but right now i wouldn't do that, um, we have a tight schedule today and i have a friend with whom i share a car., we argued where to go first., and so we compromised and, has most of her stuff and one of my stuff then after, that was one of the things that are over, then we're gonna do more of their stuff., but it, yeah, that's good., no, post traumatic stress syndrome is that what, uh, no i didn't, yes, oh, i'd say nineteen eighty, yes, i think it was nineteen eighty., yeah, that's good., um, well, my father noticed some symptoms, my father is just good, he died, but he was a psychiatrist, um, well, i wasn't sleeping, i was lying around the house, to wake me up at, at noon, something like that, and i didn't have a.., focus like for a job it wasn't clear enough, i remember a few job interviews that i would go to her front door and then i wouldn't go into <laughter> and i think that was all part of the depression, yeah, i thought i had a problem, but i didn't know what it was., no, all right., i went for three years, and then the psychiatrist said,, he thought i was finished <laughter> but uh, and i and i came to a much better place that i have to watch all the time to see what's going on, with depression, so i think i'll have good and bad days, um, i think the therapy will let you see what.., as i thought it would be as a filter or with a pair of <pa> as if you weren't really looking for a depression pair of sunglasses, you see everything through this, so you have to somehow <k> i have to somehow, try to take out the glasses for a little and double check i'm really aware of these things exactly, or see it through a depressed view, and i'm trying to find clues about it, i think i'm.., a bit slip backwards uh uh i don't do well during the unemployed periods, i have noticed on my way in my past and around the moment we have a work slower, so it is easy to slip back into sleep too late or expose things because the schedule is too far open for, for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important, it's.., it takes you out of bed and you have to go somewhere in time and, deal interaction with people is all these are all useful things for someone who tends to be depressed, uh , well, i don't know if it's changes, how i tend to be a little focused on some things that are, probably not that uplifting we say uh, but it's rather negative like i, have had <ha> somehow thought about how to, um, soldiers in the past uh i don't know why, but how the ancient greeks during the roman era or the greeks would have been in a frontline fight with, mm, they know only raw <cru> type of raw <cru> in my opinion raw weapons and no medical help and, that i don't know, i seem to be going a lot where i'm thinking about it and i've seen it and read books about it or about video clips on youtube and, eh things like this or, some other things <thi> other uh somehow like terrible doom type subjects as i watched on the animal show like crocodile attacks and such things, where should probably not be so much on that, oh, you mean well in life in general, i think i'm sorry i didn't finish college, i think i was <wa>, uh went into depression right then and wasn't coping very well in my last year, and to not really, i didn't come out of college with a degree even though i was there seven years, but uh, that's very that's a big regret that i've had, um , i think it would be.., at certain points i would probably have been looking for therapy and also probably some, uh outside help only to get through the finals only the logistics, i had i was an art major and i didn't have a car like this, many of the art projects and things were hard to move back and forth and, and also to meet uh in distant places i think it would probably have been worth, do whatever was necessary to get a car at that time, so , um , i was told that i was very patient., and i also have some original artistic ideas, so , these are, these are good qualities, which i am very loyal and also, you know, i support my friends, i'm pretty generous with them., so, yeah, that's good., let's see., really enjoyed was i had a, i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing around a football game recently, i really enjoyed that so, mhm, all right., it's been a pleasure., thank you very much.",10

imaginative and yeah, but i haven't written anything in oh for a while, but it's my drug that i don't drink or smoke or do any of the types of drugs, but uh writing was always what made me high, yeah, but i wasn't inspired., but i recently met a young girl who is a stand up and her routine is so interesting that i could write a novel of her routine, in any case <laughter>, oh <laughter> i don't know why <laughter> actually facebook told us all this stuff about how she's friends with a homeless woman and the homeless can earn four <fo> can inherit four million dollars when she comes off the

go out and work and fight for themselves, and you know you're taking care of yourself., makes me crazy people <peop> just people who just know so lazy you and they and some who go they go or they're

don't like being angry or angry, i don't really curse so much that i'm just trying to stay smart, so i'm just trying to deal with it and suppress it and work through it, i'm okay, but lately i've had outbursts and i'm probably just regretting it for lack of sleep or just, tension that rises and problems continue, but i don't like that i'm just trying to stay calm, < slaughter>, oh oh wow around, i don't like arguing, but there was <wa> i was arguing with uh, a girl who worked in a cinema and, she gave people wrong directions on which line to stand or to, and she was like she caused trouble, and i said you know they have to stand over here and they won't send them there, that they don't go into the, to the film screening and there were some discussions and i was of course right that it gave false information., that was at grauman's chinese theater, k, well, i have a twin brother i live with, but we don't understand each other, we're total opposites., i have a <laughter> sister i probably haven't seen or talked to in 18 years, i have a younger brother., i don't see him much., and what's sad i anyway in just having a mother who's still around her like < makes sounds with mouth> seventy five, probably in the last three years only no communication no phone calls no facebooking only, only separate is it like we're not interested, as she always is, i never had a father who the father left when i was four and.., she was always a housewife always yes she was always on welfare and food stamps i just she never really worked i wish she did something more she just, you know i love her, but, we don't have a relationship anymore., mhm, who was a positive influence hmm, probably good authors, probably my favorite authors who, who inspired me to write better, oh <laughter> oh god <go> i like the writer like william goldman, who is a very good writer and uh he wrote marathon man and he writes about how to write script and, wrote the princess bride he was he was an inspiration, yeah, that's good., mhm, what was that?, today's children, oh , only uh i can answer this with, two <t> mm two words <wor> three words well only, two aspects it's just too much too much video games too much technology too much skateboarding and, simply it was better if it was in the seventies when i was growing up, we didn't have to be locked in rooms or sitting in front of screens for hours and hours and hours so, and everyone is anyway that's 20 thirteen is it everyone is just trying to know that life is hard for everyone and everyone is just trying to get it through it it's hard, mhm, , generous and fun and fun to be with, and just a great guy, no, no, yes, six years ago, i probably went anyway i probably went to one it was probably one i went to a free clinic i was just things were bad i was probably interested in medication and then when she offered it to me, i've decided not to deal with it, i don't know i'm not taking <ta> i don't want to take any medication for anything, i took lipitor for high cholesterol levels and, always too much side effects fatigue and insomnia and dizziness so, i'm not taking any medication., <sigh>, of course i'm a creative person and i'm just i've just suffered depression probably all my life you know, i'm my highs and my lows, you know , oh, man, just.., just the feeling bla just walk around and just don't feel nothing if you know, not feel good about nothing or excited about something just bored so bored all the time, mhm, <laughter> i don't want to uh lately probably i've never been so bad in my whole life this is probably the last few years have just, really bad, but i'm in survival mode over it, it's pretty bad., change <sigh>, i've just become a boring person, oh you know, i'm going to all these free events all the time trying to save money i'm out i'm out every night i'm never i'm rarely home all the time, with a good anyway you know going to events with a good time then, but it's as if i'm trying to get out of life, it's live in cinemas just trying, just, block everything out, that's not good, no, mm, wasn't really in therapy, but i know it, but i know it again, he was a korean guy he just said yes your depression did you suffer depression you maybe even i can be bipolar, but , you know i'll take care of it., now believe it or not, if it's just dark and quiet, i'll sleep pretty well eight to ten hours, sometimes good <laughter> because i snore sometimes i can't sleep at <a> sometimes i get thrown out of the apartment it's a small apartment, and i didn't sleep anywhere, i slept in alleys, i slept, you know it in the gates, just to experience it, and i'm and i'm not homeless, because you know, and that's when i can't sleep when i get two or three hours, so there's your answer in me, i can sleep okay because, because i'm always tired, i'm very tired and i'm a heavy snoring, i snore like a chainsaw, so you've got it, <sigh>, what are you doing?, i'm okay i'm you know i'm just anyway you know people can say i'm just sleepy and just not likely irritable and just want to make darkness come and, let me sleep for at least four or five six hours., if i get some, i'll be fine., okay, i was <laughter> around i had a gambling habit <ha> uh i had a gambling addiction that kind of screwed up my whole life you lose uh you know pretty much lost everything, the last time i was happy, i probably took sixty dollars to a casino, made it in twelve hundred dollars so, so the next <ne> so good, so i had twelve hundred dollars in my pocket well i turned sixty well that's oh anyway it was exciting, but of course in the next few days that twelve hundred dollars was liquidated it went because i was just stupid and became greedy, but that's when i'm the happiest likely to go to a casino and win or just stay and lose nothing, that's where my adrenaline is, yeah, it's got <laughter> it got me uh it got me where i am today yeah, too much blackjack, only bad, but, otherwise in the last three years it's not i had you know no i'm not much i don't play < gam> it's gambling is not worth it and in the end you lose everything, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., haha yes apology accepted, i'm generous, i'm a nice guy, you know i'm not going to be wrong, and i'm very reliable., i'll help you out., i'll lend you a few dollars., i think i'm fine., nothing., , i just hope you know how <laughter> so there's a second chapter in my life at my age, we're gonna see right now that i'm just freaking out the time of killing., it's probably already been four years, now only of nothingness, mm ask <as> ask say that again, , manage your money better, you know, you know, who would i never think i would have six numbers in the bank, but i did, but there's a lot of that anyway you just < laughter>, i it evaporates very slowly you know and and so that advice is you know, probably just don't play <laughter>, and keep your money knowing you are trying to find some other means of excitement <ex> of excitement, but, but for me at this blackjack table, with big wages, my reality was that reality was better than being outside the casino, my reality was right there on, now texas keep them i did okay you know with that you know that i wouldn't lose much, i'm a pretty good player to this blackjack, i took everything., mhm, <sigh> okay that i had these twelve years twelve years <yea> i owned a casting company for twelve years and provided uh, people work for movies and tv shows and a lot of audience, so i had a lot of money for twelve years and traveled the time of my life, so at least on my deathbed i can say of, ninety six to two thousand eight, i had the best <be> i had 12 years that i i never thought i'd ever only have money anyway, <sigh> i haven't done <sigh> uh

360,"yes, i'll do it well and myself., inglewood, the landscape the places to eat, i was just.., i just love it, the transport of the public transit it is, yes, to come to new places and see new sights, i studied nursing and office administration, well, i've been taking care of people in the nagging area and office administration i've always wanted me to be always in computers and wanted more about the software and things and how to fix them and things like this, no <n> not right now, but i want to work there in the future <f> i want to work in the future, i worked in a store, but now i'm just looking for a job., my dream job is actually at the subway in public transport to help improve public transport in l a, yeah, that's good., i watch t v mostly listen to music like gentle jazz like relaxing music, i breathe i hear music i try to do what i can to calm down, the things that really make me angry are like if i'm kind of disrespectful per se, if it is, when bad things happen, it really irritates me., i'm as good as i think i am, but there are times when i feel i can't, but i try as hard as i can to control it, i argued with my fianc over a few weeks about some financial problems anyway, but that was it, no i didn't, no i didn't, no i didn't, pretty easy most of the time, but if it's like noises around me then it'll be a little harder like a neighbor party or loud noises in the house then it's hard, but usually it's easy, i'm really tired in the morning, like i don't have any attitude or anything, but i'm like tired in the morning, like i need more sleep when i wake up, i feel okay, just i'm down sometimes i sleep a little when i'm sleeping more than i'm used to, but i was okay, no, they would describe me as fun loving carefree a caring individual a caring person, no <n> no not really i mean i've had some bad experiences, but for the most part i don't regret anything, to do what i need to do, to really take care of my business and that's about it, i felt really happy at christmas when i got engaged <laughter>, i enjoy going to nevada to celebrate my birthday i enjoy spending time with my family and friends, there were some things that got us apart, but we're trying to get closer., my grandmother she's really she lets me really see the light they really let me see the good in me they really let me see that i'm a positive individual and that i can achieve everything i put my opinion, i am proud of my accomplishments, i am proud that no matter what people say about me or think about me., that i was able to achieve things in my life without doing the things that the negative things people thought i was going to do, that they thought i was going to do it., my best qualities is that i am very efficient i, i am a good listener a good thinker a good speaker i can overcome many situations and, i feel like a good person., goodbye.",4
361,"yes, i'm doing great, how about you?, i was born in u s i was born in uh orlando florida, my parents, my dad had a lot of friends in los angeles, so we decided to move here., it was quite different. i mean, the place i was before was very, very small town., you probably won't even notice it on the map, so it was a great learning experience because you know that the schools were much bigger and, different cultures and ethnicities around, so it was a unique experience, the last time i was back, it was probably five years ago., um definately different uh my aunt she lives again uh she lives in a small town, so if you want to go to a movie theater, you have to drive at least an hour or if you want to go to a mall, it's an hour's drive, so it's the complete opposite of los angeles., around the convenience all i could wish for is here around the weather is great to shop around multiple <mult> many friends here, sport around l a is like the perfect area, you know, i want to live here for the rest of my life., the big thing would probably be traffic, i mean, wherever you go, there'll be traffic, whether you're on the four to five or the one to one it's just traffic it it's it you know it can kill like two hours in your day that's huge, um yeah pretty a bit for personal and for uh for business i travel around you know usually overseas or around inland around me travel so and i enjoy it a lot, to see different places uh, different areas meet new people to eat different types of food around, when i have a day or two off, it's easy to have new experiences that enrich my life., data processing equipment, um and i also have english as well, yes, i am., i work in i t in an i t department at a semiconductor company, dream job, probably working for apple <laughter> since i own quite a lot of everything they have uh yeah, it would be great to work for apple, it is important that there are times when it is good to be alone, but for the most part i consider myself an outgoing social person., to nothing too much i guess if you kind of make a promise and you and you break it several times and i might get a little bit a bit a little uh angry, but i don't think i'd really get angry, to ask a good question, i would say i tend to eat a little more., just kind of keep my mind a little bit around but usually doesn't last that long, so i kind of tend to think like i tend to eat a little more of arta like maybe junk food or something, i think i'm pretty good i'm rarely getting angry around and when i do it, it doesn't really take long, so i think i'm pretty good, i guess i'm controlling my temper again, i really don't get angry, so it's not really a problem for me., um, i would say during the elections we talked about uh president obama and mitt romney and you know who would be the best fit for the next presidency to, this kind was a little uh i think a little heated, but it was more for uh i think more for fun than anything else, but it was an interesting conversation, um, like to eat a lot of uh movies uh play video games around, just go shopping uh play sports uh watch a laker game if i can personally, it would probably be the best to, bowling photography to do a lot, i like to do a lot of different things around and of course electronics, to i would say, starting loyally to intelligent funny, and a great listener, no, i didn't., no, no, for most nights it's pretty easy to simply avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep, except that it was pretty easy, to say a little sluggish tired around type of reaction time is a little slower, apart from that, i don't think anything too much like too bright or something, the usual is just sluggish and, not as fast as i should move, to have pretty good no complaints, not pretty much the same, i guess today i had my car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything, so that's great and i thought it would cost me, you know a little extra on the site, but you know the uh the service consultant gave it up, so i've got everything for free today so actually i'm in a really good mood, no, nothing., uh probably not saving so much money uh apart from the, nothing else is just somehow more, wisely with your money, i would probably say my best friend, he's kind of a you know, helped me out and i helped him out too, so it's a kind of great learning experience uh, you know, developing our friendship, and he saved me a couple of times that i saved him, too, so it's kind of a common thing that we're doing., you know each other, and it's, you know, it's like a good way to connect., hmm, i'd say i'm probably going back to korea to visit my relatives, they know they're a lot different than i remember., fifteen years ago, when i was a child, i was actually afraid of some of them., but now that i see them, you know they've been mitigating a lot lately and they're actually, it was a kind of learning experience for me because they know they finished an 80's when i was a child., um, i'm saying,, rate, work would be a part of it around, buying my uh the car that i wanted it took a few years to save up to buy the car, but i paid it all so i didn't pay more car payments so that's also great and you know able to help my uh family as well, hmm, um , let's see., a while recently <recen> by a few weeks i went to uh las vegas for the uh, for c s around that's great when you get into gadgets and electronics to see you all the uh the goodies coming this year, so that was uh pretty interesting to see and, to see some things that uh you know when you read on blogs they don't talk about, so you actually experience it in person from a user perspective, so i thought it was great, it's just fun being like a kid in a candy store that you can play with different gadgets, so i really enjoyed it., yeah, that's good.",0
362,"yes, good, from california, i like the art and entertainment i like anyway, the, you have a lot of freedom to work in many different areas around, i like the fact that the weather is great around i like the fact that all my roots are here all my family is here, i don't like it., how hard it is, places more it is very difficult there is so much traffic it takes a long time to get where you go around it is expensive, it is much more expensive than it used to be, not more, i studied journalism english music and special effects make up, i'm, now i run a doggy day care facility, it's my dream job,, own my own company again, probably working with animals, no, i'm an artist i draw i paint i do tattoos, i work a lot with animals, i like outdoor activities cycling hiking, people who are not just people, who, angry and for people who are dishonest, usually i will give myself like a second timeout and think about it before i speak or react, i'm very good at controlling my temperament, probably my spouse has something to do with our financial affairs., i am very close to my children and my father, , no, it's never easy, it's the hardest job in the world, but it's the best, just.., you want to prevent your children from making the mistakes you had, but you realize that they have to do that., just to learn how to live life is one of the most difficult things to let them make their own mistakes., the unconditional love my boys have for me,, everything a parent has made me a better person, it has made me a better all that a better employee around me has, i think having my kids made me, much better person every day, i probably have a lot i had a very full life, i would be really hard to say that i have so many, i'm a good friend i'm a true friend i'm honest i'm real, i'm reliable., and i'm not playing games i'm very i'm not a drama, no, yes, i have, in order, february of two thousand eleven, i was attacked by a stalker and almost killed in november of two thousand nine he broke into my apartment and lay waiting for me and attacked me when i came into the door and tried to kill myself, i know., i think therapy has helped me enormously, i don't think i would be able to keep a job and be responsible and, be , a productive member of society <s> of society without therapy, i'm able to handle things better i'm not getting so emotionally excited about much more rational i'm trying to stay more rational than emotionally rational and logical, so i was sick and i was a little stressed, i've got it., i use the resources <res> and use the resources i've learned and grab other people i'm not trying to isolate., i'm trying to.., use the tools given to me in therapy to, i don't use drugs anymore, so it's mostly proactive treatment where i have to do something about it., it's not it's never easy it's always bad, tired lethargic, it's hard to keep my thoughts around it's hard to just do the basics during the day, mm no, i can't remember, oh i went to the beach with my oldest son and his best friend and we drove three real tricycle bikes and that was a lot of fun, it's hard to say right now i haven't decided that i'm very proud of my kids i'd say it's likely that they're really good guys, i have too many regrets at the moment, to finish school, to the, stay focused to not, let me be distracted, focus more on long term objectives than on short term objectives, my father, i'm very honest, i'm very calm, i don't get angry easily, it takes a lot to provoke me., i'm reliable when i say i do something i do., and i'm not i'm basically what you see is what you get, i don't hit people, to do everything with animals i love animals i always smile around animals every kind big small, i like older people older people i like to help them and be around them, i like kids, um",20
363,", yes, all right, how are you?, i'm from los closeles, yes, um, it's uh center of everything anyway you drive to all the places you need to uh eh without being very far, i like being in town, all right., in l a you are also dealing with traffic a lot of traffic jams, and around obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not so big, but, you know you live with it, i was a business manager, so i studied economics and.., after i finished college, uh pursued a career in retail, uh no i'm actually not i'm kind of a changed career, over the last four or five years, so i focus more on the company's staff side., a few factors around i after many years in the retail trade, i switched and worked in a uh creative business that was a graphic design company and i uh caught a knowledge < knowledge> a lot of knowledge about, in the a in the personnel page because i was the company manager slash benefits manager for a small company, yes, i'm very happy that i did that, and i've collected a lot of knowledge and uh, and it's very helpful, < slaughter>, well, my dream job is.., i'm basically doing what i want to do now because i'm a uh., independent contractor i do freelance work as a consultant with all the knowledge i gained from previous jobs, and i use that with the flexibility to do the things i want to do as far as personal and have the time i need to do the things i want to do, and obviously i have worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already in place so, i do what i need to do as far as to get a certain lifestyle, but also i also enjoy what i do, i'm not under as much stress as i used to be, mm, i'm not, well, i'm not quite out, but i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm, probably right in the middle maybe more towards going out, but i'm not completely starting out i mean, when i'm with other people, i'm in a social situation, i guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but.., obviously i have my own little uh private problems that i hold for myself, oh, sure you know i'm.., a few years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass surgery and it had to, yes, it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about much other than those around me that are close to me., when i meet someone new, i'm not just saying openly that you know that i've experienced this and that, so basically, i'm just.., when it comes, i won't deny it, or when it comes and when it is, when it feels like it's something i'm going to talk about, in fact,, my relaxation is up, i'm just around, living with my mother my mother and uh she's an elderly citizen and she's alone around what i do to relieve uh relaxation or stress is i actually help her to work yard, take care of all the gardening and such things and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know,, i'm not.., i'm not, it takes a lot to make me really angry as far as my temper is concerned., there's not much to it., um, i'm trying to think here, i can't remember the last time it was, but it was probably sometime last year when i had a creditor i was dealing with., very difficult to work with to, and i owed money as far as some medical expenses that had occurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh, they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh uh i was really a little upset about it because, i felt like i was being honest with them and i was more than willing to take care of my problems, but uh, they played hardball and i didn't care about it., it does <laughter>, probably the toughest decision i ever had to make was to, it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who fought against uh prostate cancer and, yes uh a decision to make with my mother whether using a procedure that was either to help him, or there was an easy chance that it would help him even though he was pretty much at the end at this point, or it would kill him you know, and that was really hard, it was really hard to make decision, but uh uh you know, i, i felt like i wasn't trying to see if we could save his life <l> helping to save his life or if we weren't taking any chances and taking this extra step that i would regret in the long run, it's, it was, um, i'm separated from my wife, so she has her problems, i have my problems, but we're not divorced, we're just separated., and we still have a relationship in which we still talk, we just don't live together., and the relationship with my mother is really great, you know, she's very understanding i'm a single child so, she likes to have me what is good because she is eighty two years old in her late she at her later stage of her life, and, and so she must, i guess it's a good thing that fate may have happened in its own way, because you know anyway,, someone eighty two years old alone in a huge house is not a good thing, but with me because i think she feels <fe> it's a comfort level she feels at me because especially her only child, probably the most guilty i feel about anything are the things i did to hurt my marriage, um, as far as.., the things i did the selfish things i did when i was much younger, which obviously influenced the relationship between me and my wife, oh, yeah, i.., in a situation in which , to make me work enormous amounts of hours under a lot of stress my wife also worked a lot of hours in a job that she had and uh we grow apart, and when she was gone, my form of release was, uh, going to the casinos and playing and so, you know, i spent a lot of time at the casinos, and what happened was that i spent a lot of money., and obviously this was an important topic in relation to our relationship, had to do with trust because to, it was devastating for my wife, i felt when it came to light, i felt very guilty, and i felt less than a person at this point in my life, no, not at all., no not really no, i have no problems sleeping, that's i can never remember having any problems, so no, no, not at all, no, i'm good i just < deep breath> the only thing i could say is, after i had my heart attack a few years ago, i won't let the little details or little things in my life bother me the way i used to., so i tend to be a little easier and my friends and family have noticed that, the last time i felt really happy, um, probably, if, i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack, and, he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that, he was glad to explain that there was no scar tissue., no larger scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart attack, and that i could count on a fairly normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medication, well, i guess number one is uh, my physical being itself, i may be a little healthier to lose some more weight, um, just generally just be healthier physically, and as far as mental for just not, go back to those ways of thinking where i did the wrong things instead of the right things and not being so selfish, only one day at a time, you know i just.., try to be at peace with myself and try to have a little rest on a daily basis, i'm meditating, i'm reading, you know, i'm reading a few books, i'm watching to do things i know when i can, when i can help myself, i do things to help myself, well, there's a lot i obviously regret in my marriage, uh my uh professional career, as far as i've had a long career with this majors uh food chain and, and i basically ended up ruining a very good career because of my gambling problems, but, um, at this point at the moment there's not much i can do, i can't change what has been done, so i don't focus too much on the past, i'm just looking at what's in front of me and just focusing on what's in front of me., what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing, for yourself and you know, make the changes that need to be changed, you know i'm not., i'm not someone who's not intelligent, but i was smart enough to know what's right and.., , you are what you do is wrong, you need to change your behavior immediately, likely, the proud thing i'm proud of is the fact that, i've done all these terrible things, but deep down, i don't think i'm a bad person as a person i need to remember., when i was trapped in all this gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because i had a disease, a compulsive, uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me sick and that i was a sick person trying to get better, and every day what my life is about it is about recovery and uh, i'm just making sure i do the right things, from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night., one day at a time, it's not as hard as you think it is, but it's a process in which, you must be diligent about your behavior and routines, and just to know that what's not right for you, you know that it might be okay for other people to do certain things, but i can't do those things anymore., most of my best friends can describe me as likely, generous and generous, to be a nice person to be near, and, you know, they were obviously a little shocked when they found out about all my problems., uh in connection with gambling and the, mine and the separation from my marriage you know it's not over, you know., well, my ideal weekend usually starts around, after having breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock, i'm going to a local park and it's about, this park is probably set up where you can go up a hill and down a hill it is about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning, um, my blood is flowing and my heart rate starts and then after that.., you know you're going home., work in the yard a few hours, shower and relax and then, just uh somehow step back for the rest of the day and then the next day i do the same in the morning again i go for a walk, train in the yard, watch t v whatever easy relax, so goes a weekend for me, and thank you, see you.",0
364,"i'm, i feel pretty good i'm far awake i had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee, and i'm having a simple day today, so i'm just gonna chat with you, then i'm gonna go to the gym and do some errands, so i'm planning on having a nice day today., i was born and raised in los engles, and i'm one of the few locals from here, and i went away to school and uh, but i'm one of the few natives who are actually in los angeles, yes, i am., i like the weather, owned by a holiday home in another state, that i found too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here, i like culture, i like diversity, i like the familiarity, i like the beaches, uh but i also like that only an hour and a half away you can go into the desert say palm springs palm desert, but also an hour and a half away you can go to arrowhead or big bears and go snowboarding or skiing or things like the, and i think it's a great place to live, thank you., all right., more of some perhaps some of the, things i don't like about l a or say california in general, say how the high tax rate, which is the state tax rate up to 13 point something now, which the business here will also banish the regulations, i'm a little entrepreneur, so all regulations are clearly impacting on the business so many of my colleagues have their business according to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated, and that's a big problem here in uh, uh california, it really does most people don't understand, but it's uh, whether or not in the form of tubes, pipes or pipes, you know, besides high taxes, you know that there's a big immigration problem that's born and raised here, most people don't., but it's a big tax on the social system., and that makes our taxes, uh so high until they really secure the borders and take care of it, so this is, you know, but people don't really seem to want to deal with it, um, but it's clearly affecting companies because of all the other things that our taxes are so high and people are moving out of the state., i enjoy traveling i was in sixty six countries, and uh, i don't travel as much as i used to., but i've already traveled a little bit., and i learned a few languages and uh, i served it., i'm sorry., uh, i didn't really understand your question., when you said what i think you didn't understand what i said, but i'm just gonna go back and, i was all over europe east of europe, asia, south america, north africa, around and i enjoy this and enjoy warm climate now especially where you can go and relax and there is warm water for surfing, because the cold water makes my back stiff, and i also like to train and surf and do yoga, and train and uh, i'm trying to eat healthy and uh, it's a big part of my life., oh, safe, to one of my favorite trips of all time i was used to seeing when i was younger how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a period of three or four weeks, but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed about a week and really got to know the city, although i had been there about ten times., we got to know the city really well, which was really great, lived like a local, and rented a small apartment and, cooked and has our own shopping, but really, so often i have never stayed there longer than three or four days, it has been fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city, and it was fun, even if i grew up in l a and read french, there was no large spanish speaking population when i was younger, my mother insisted that we all have children, take french, although spanish would have been much more valuable, but i took french uh, all by uh elementary junior high and uh high school, so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a lot and even though i stopped speaking french, with the french, you know, and my accent isn't the biggest, so after a few sentences, they start talking to me in english., <laughter> so it was a, uh, i've got a few different degrees, so uh i was a marine science major as an undergraduate, and uh, that was fun., and i also have a master, uh degree in economics, and i have a degree in crisis management, so, i found her., interesting, and uh, it was something i wanted to do, where i went to college i went to the marine academy to play sports, and i found it very interesting to go to school in maryland from southern california, and i originally wanted to be a doctor, but, when you start going to school, for a little change your mind, etcetera so, i'm in the wholesale trade now., for wholesalers of furniture products, and it was a family business, but i went to work there a number of years ago, well you know my grandfather and recently father died so i kind of run an eighty year old family business, and it's, pretty interesting, i like it that it grew up around her, but it's different from other jobs i've had in the past, hm, actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i have changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home, and uh, uh, i would probably like to stay home and raise children because i have a daughter, and uh, you know she couldn't spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would have wished., but i think i'd be better than saying a lot of women i know i really want to work i really like to cook and hang out in the house and take care of children, you know i like it, i'm always part time, but do that with pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy who would be fun to stay home and uh do that with pretty much worked most of my life, so, probably never happen, but it sounds like something i'd enjoy, uh i think i'm around generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when i meet someone or feel comfortable, i think i'm more of an extrovert., while most strangers think i'm introverted, but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is, i can meet a stranger and be completely confident or people i've known for years either from a personal or a business situation, and be more, introverted, i mean, i just go with the dynamics, but i think my outer manifestation is a little shyer in general and reserved <reser> i use the term reserved, oh wow, that's a great idea i had that on uh, one of my i have uh several computers at home, and that was one of my screensavers., i usually tend when i relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or go for a long walk or go for a long walk or go for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it is yoga or go for a long walk or go to the gym or go for a walk or go to the beach, maybe surf when the weather is warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes, it gives me like a brain freezes, although i surfed for you know over thirty years, i had, it's.., i usually find exercise helps me to relax the best, or sometimes just on the couch in front of the t v i find very relaxing <laughter>, but i like this screensaver i had at home on one of my screensavers, but, yeah, that was uh, that's it, but.., this is one of the things that took me a number of years to master even though my relaxation skills were, i probably didn't have the best in my twenties, but over the years, i think i've gotten better., at the, i think this is an important thing and i think as we mature, how we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and, be a little more, how did you have the skills before, i think i'm pretty good i think i'm much better than how i've aged, um, you know, i, i'll think before i speak now, while saying twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought, so i could have said more things that i, in any tense situation, whether it is personal or, a work situation, um, but i have never had a violent temper, but i have a temper where i fly away from the handle instead of taking a deep breath and thinking about it., i think i'm much better at it now than i said in my teens or twenties., so if i think a lot of it comes from, i think the keyword is maturity, oh wow, you know, i haven't really been arguing with anyone in a couple of years, which is what i used to do as a traditional, argument to, likely, um, my ex wife a few years ago we had a argument essentially just about my daughter, and it was nothing violent, but it was only heated, basically one of the reasons why we were not married our values were so different just our ideas of education, and uh just, i think that caused such a different view of life., but i don't know if i'd call it an argument., but it was more of just one of them let us agree to disagree, back of head, so, i felt like i was talking to a wall, and i actually felt more angry at me that i had, earlier in life learned that the boy that before you have married someone children with them, is the kind of discussion that people should, usually have, but you don't really think about it because, sometimes when we're younger, we're, look at boys, how does it look that i was great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me, but you know, i'm pretty easy to walk and i've got, different, ideas about raising children as they did, and that was more, not that she was wrong and i wasn't right that i was right and she was wrong, it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really, about these things discussed, but it was really just basic, reasons why we butted heads and more were not really a good match, considering that other things looked good, you know on paper for both of us, hm, there's one that my father recently passed away., thank you., and, really because in our religion you know that you are planning a funeral very quickly you know usually within a few days, and i have really only invited very close friends and family members, i was more or less responsible for my father being remarried, but his widow was somehow, not really up to him, so i took care of it and i wish i had invited one, i kept it very private and really just said the people after the fact, that he would have known that if they had known, he would have liked to go to the ministry., about it so i really only invited because only the time pressure really only a handful of people, but, now that time has passed, i wish i had invited you., more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just.., and even distant family members that i really only told after the fact that i really didn't invite them because, i was under time pressure, but i could have just done it by e mail, or it's hard to call anyone personally, but, i wish that was something because people said something., they were mad at me when my other family members threw everything back at me, oh you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know that and so it was over, so they threw it at me because i was more or less, to do it, so i wish i had done it differently, but i did the best i could at the time, so i'm not really, angry at myself about something that i probably should have been better prepared for something < s something that came was inevitable so, well, my two parents have been here lately, died in the last few years, and i had a brother whom i had three younger brothers, one of whom died., in december, and, we are not super close as i always look at other families, we were just never so norman rockwell uh painting, i guess we're different, too., and uh, i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family, not that it's weird, but i wish it was more like a boy from one of those families that came together every sunday and had dinner and all that, we just, we never did that because we all, all so uh, uh different, yeah, it's just being, but.., you know strangers and most people, i just say that you know how the family everyone is great you know, but i think every family has its own kind of, goods, no, but i thought i could have had it before., some other events in my life and i was just not sure that i was going to have a therapy in the past just out, you know, i was in the military, and i was never really sure that was exactly what it was., but i think i'm working, pretty good, but i wasn't sure that i had been to therapy and counseling over the years., i didn't sign up as an officer., i went to one of the service academies, the, i started at seventeen when i was in high school., and i went to a service academy, so it's more prestige it's just not, it's the hard place where i went it's the hardest school in america to get in, i was as old as everyone else who went there., we did it., eighty three, um, just was basically nothing intense it was just we were just around some we were just, we were not allowed to carry ammunition, we were just our position, were only shot at., at the moment, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so, that was a, it wasn't too much., too intense it was much you know because it was the service i was in training much more intense than any actual combat situation, that's because they train you well, it's like practicing harder than you play, when you're an athlete, when you play football, you practice harder than you do., you actually play in the game and the same with uh, you know if you're in the fight., unit, well it made me become patriotic grown up, in california, whereas people from all over the country , and i have to meet while most say my friends who grew up in wealthy loose angels as i did, never really went and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i, at the end always uh, only patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country, while in southern california you really don't grow up with it, while someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or, georgia north dakota south dakota montana, grows up with this kind of uh, pride, so i thought it was good and it, unlike so many of my friends who, you don't know there's a life between malibu and manhattan., i graduated, i was still in reserves, but i went to graduate school., and i have two graduates, and i went to work in the private company, uh, i didn't care., then i stepped into the fire department i was a fireman and paramedic, for a number of years and, then, after i got divorced, it was more difficult to deal with the custody situation with my daughter, so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell, um, at first it was because i had such an attitude in my butt, of the way i went, i spoke, and again i was an officer, you were very regiment on the way you were dressed in your private time it was harder taking me a while, in order to be able to get back to loose narrowes, uh, because it was just so uh, so different i think i have it better than most i have a stronger personality, so, but.., it was a great experience, um, it all depends on whether i do sports regularly and i don't eat too late, and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well, even though i may have to get up and go to the bathroom once a night.., but i sleep in general uh, i sleep pretty well in general, i've been feeling pretty good lately, you know, i was like any other more periods of blue in your life, but, boy in the last few months i feel pretty big, no, not really., i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately, i thought maybe in the past, because i have a family history of it., and, you know, it wasn't, everything really to weaken, and i couldn't really work, on my own, but i was busy looking for advice, i did i was really against it in the past, and until after i left, i mean, i wish i was going to say more during my uh, my marriage over the course of my life now i think it's very useful, but in the past, i was one of those i grew up and heard it was just ridiculous., and it was a waste of money etcetera, but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it, oh just a few questions i just wanted to know an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you,, life relations, and sometimes it's good to speak things out with a, a professional, even if i wouldn't see someone like you in real life, i prefer someone older than i am a little more life experience than someone who might be younger, so, but yes, i think it's a useful tool and, i really have a hundred and eighty degree switch on that, i'm not going now, i'm taking a break, but i'm not against having a few problems i want to bounce off., i have someone i'm going to, yeah, that's good., i think it's nice., you know that she really, when you go to someone who is good and again i've been to some different people and bought some kind of therapist, they really don't tell you what to think, what i think is great., always in the past they just help you talk through your, your thoughts, and your feelings and let you decide, but bring a little clarity, to the situation, so i like, to talk to someone who has much more life experience, and i'm generally more comfortable talking to a woman about this stuff than telling a man, well, but it's, um, i think it's a useful tool i have some good ideas and, was able to talk to some things from totally someone who is unbiased and not in your everyday life, instead of having a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you, but sometimes the people of strangers hop is good, this morning., i know that's weird, but i'm clearly someone and i'd say that as a joke to my friends and, family and staff i have clearly i have a simple day today because i knew we have nice weather, and i have a number of errands to run, and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder, but i woke up so happy today when i know it will be eighty degrees out, and when the weather is nice, i am usually much happier than when the weather laughter is dark and blue and rainy and cold, where i always know that the term so, but i'm just good i woke up very happy today because i knew it would be a nice day, and i was looking forward to the sun, so, most of my friends i'm a kind of renaissance man i know a little about a lot of topics, i'm too smart for my own good., and i'm a, i know a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational, i'm very resourceful, people always call me when they have problems, and i help to speak them through them, or i am resourceful and tell them where to go, whether it's where you buy a new computer or buy a new car, or, you know, i'm great with medical diagnoses., uh, and uh, you know, people say i'm a lot of fun, too., i'm amusing to be with you, and, i also have i don't have many gray areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white, i am what i am, i'm not b s, you know, i am the opposite of a politician., so i'm not telling people what they want to hear, i'm not rude to anyone, but i'm pretty much calling things as i see them., so that's pretty much, no, not really, because i do everything tactfully, i like to think i'm doing it, uh, i probably spent more time with my parents before they died, but i was busy, uh, i wish i could spend more time with my daughter when she was younger., uh, but only a lot of it is very typical, really think things through a little more, be a little less impulsive, or pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now, i think that's it and i'd look at things in the long run instead of looking at them., in the short term you know when you make decisions or decisions, i'm proud of my daughter., a nice young lady i'm uh, proud of my public service, i've never really got a job for my money, military and fire service, there are very few people like me who did it., who are, had the background in the education i did, but i like public service, and, so i'm proud that, proud of all the certificates i hang on my walls at home and degrees, type of trophies, i am proud that i have been able to stay in good physical condition over the years and, knock wood get good health, it was nice to meet you., goodbye, thank you.",0
365,"safe, i'm fine., new jersey, yes, three months ago, not very often, it's a lot different., uh, i don't know, it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here, to start a new life for me, it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh, it was.., it was pretty hard at first, but i'm still trying to get used to life here., i met some good friends here., um, you know, i love the hollywood area around, and only you know the mountains are beautiful, they're kind of things i love, hmm, transport, not really no i don't, just didn't have the time or the finances to, digital media, all right., i've always loved you., < deep breath> computer and you know to design things and uh i don't know that i somehow fell into it, no, i got out., well, i guess my dream job would work in something that, uh i went to school for you know i've never really completed my education, um, but i guess it would be great if i went, you know it back to school, and you know, ready you know my, completion in digital media, and you know i'm done., and uh started working you know something to do in this area, a little of both you know that sometimes i can be shy, but, i like to push myself to leave me, you know it's a fight for me, but, i don't want you to know it in a shell, so i kind of force myself to be out, i hear music sometimes i just drive and around, you know, playing music in my car and that helps me relax, or i smoke a cigarette, oh like what oh um <laughter>, just heavy metal, that's all i hear is metal., good <sigh>, it's all about it., how high my stress level is and how angry i am, but i, i'm doing my best to, not so pissed on <laughter>, , and, i don't know if she's.., she wanted me to pick her up., she was a little drunk., and uh we somehow fought over the phone all over some other things and, i just didn't pick her up., because of her attitude on the phone with me, yeah, that's good., it shall , something i feel guilty about is not talking to my children, common, or as often as i should, i was just so busy trying to, i don't really have time to find my way around here., you know i talk to my kids as much as i want., you have no idea, um, it comes naturally, but it's not easy, and it's the hardest job i love to do, but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away, and i made this choice to come here, and i feel bad that i don't see them you know, but, the reason i got out of here was to improve myself so i could take care of her., anxiety, you know, fear <f> only fear you will know that you are afraid of what will happen to your children you fear, the, something terrible is going to happen, and, they do not see, brings forth this fear much more, you know, and i can't always be there with them, i can't see them, you know, it wasn't that bad when i lived in florida., um, and i at least saw her, it wasn't very often, but i used to see her, now i don't see her at all, and, that's the hardest thing i've had., doing as a parent, is, get away from my kids if i just don't know for a while how long i'll be here., i don't know what my future will bring, but, the hardest part is,, so far away from them, only the joy they bring me, i mean, i could have a bad day, and they're just firing me up, i mean,, i eh, it's annoying to be away from them for so long, and they're so far away, and do not see their faces,, it's the worst thing you've ever known., but, i, i love to see their faces that just bring a smile to my face, and, i don't know., well, um.., i think, the fact that i can, up to their level, um, i'm a little silly <laughter>, as a father, when my father was with me, my father was, you know, strictly safe all the time that he knows you, laugh and play with us, but, you know he was always very reserved., you know, and he held a lot, he held a lot of his emotions just because, you know he was a strong, very tough guy., um, but with me i am very silly and stupid with my children and i am strict when i have to be, but, i always love it, you know you're playing around with them., as much as possible, you don't know, i don't want them growing up too fast., and that this may, yeah, that's good., good <sigh>, a situation i wish i had treated differently, there are so many <laughter>, uh, i guess when i was still with my ex wife, in florida, i wish i hadn't, got so angry or i wish i hadn't let her get the best out of my emotions, she had a tendency to, go under my skin, and you know it, pick me until i'm ready., i exploded., and, i allowed her to do that., you know, i just would've, left when i could, and you know i can't get the best of myself., no, sometimes it's hard., um, sometimes i just lay awake in bed you know, thinking all the things going through my mind all you know, all the stress that i'm going through, with work and you know, ensure that , you know, i wonder if i'll be able to give you the rent?, you know what my kids are going through?, do you know when i'll see her again if she even takes care of me?, when they know they have a father, you know, these are some of the things that run through my mind and, and that sometimes stops me at night, a little <sigh> but <sigh>, you know i got into this situation., you know i have to, you know i have to take it., you know that you reap what you sow, so i <sigh>, i have to deal with this my way., lately, um, i tried to, don't think so much about, you know everything that goes into my life, i'm trying to distract myself, and this kind of, get me in a better mood, you know if i'm hanging out with friends or, look at something to get me distracted by you., all the burdens in my life, um, the last time i felt really happy, uh, was actually a few nights ago i went drinking around, with some of my friends from work and around, i don't know., we just.., pretty drunk and simple <laughter>, that kind of helped me forget, all the crap that was there., before went through my head, so if i can distract myself, if i can forget all this, other material, then i am happy <sigh>, some of my best qualities i think i'm convinced <laughter>, um, i'm kind of like a, i guess you'd say a consultant to some people you know some of my close friends, you know, i like to persuade people to do things they can regret, or i mean, i'm sorry to talk to people about things they might regret in the end., or i can, you know you only listen to people so you know., i could say that you know that i definitely know you're listening to my friends and helping them in their time of need when they're going through something., scary times like i'm going through, , uh who lives in florida, you know i talk to him every once in a while and, he's having trouble with his girlfriend and, you know i'm just kind of, to talk to him about his problems and listen to me mostly <mo> i hear mainly because you know that i don't think he has anyone else to listen to., do you know when i was living in florida?, i was very close to him so you know he always relied on me., and now that i'm here in l a, i don't want to lose you knowing the connection to him, because i mean, i've always been there for him, so.., he.. he.. he.. he.. he.. he.. he.. he.. he.., he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him advice, you know what i think you know he should., um, so i think, <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad he knows you rely on me for that, he trusts me enough to tell me all this., i don't know., sometimes i wish i wasn't like that, kind or generous, it seems bad, but sometimes i don't know that people can take advantage of me, and i can't see it, and, i don't like to say no to people i like, people always to please, so if i can change that maybe i wish i hadn't fallen such a people, sometimes financially in difficulty <laughter> <low breath> sometimes i know, you know, help others and don't know you, that can break me sometimes yes i can not have enough to, paying invoices, but, i feel better to help people, i don't know., i regret, not, breaking up with my ex wife earlier, i regret <re> i regret <re>, because she's been through so much crap in my life, and, i've always tried, be a people i like, i tried to please her., you know, try,, please my children as much as i can, by not dissolving, you know the family, but, you know, there's only so much a person can take., and i probably think if i left earlier, i could have been happier, and things may not have gotten as out of control as they have done., you know, during all the years with her, so, maybe if i got out early., i don't know that i would have been happier, i guess., um, it's okay to be selfish., it's okay., you know, sometimes think of yourself, you know when you keep putting everyone in front of you, then you don't think about yourself, you don't think about what makes you happy, and even if, falling people may make you happy, uh you sometimes have to think about yourself and your needs, because, you know, they play an important role, in, the life of your close family members, and, to keep everything above water, sometimes you have to worry about the one person who, you know you juggle everything and stop everything you're yourself., be a little selfish sometimes it's okay, i don't even know what a weekend is anymore., my ideal weekend would be, alone locked up in my room, watching movies that only listen to music, with my, turn off mobile phone and, you don't know you're with someone or it could be at a bar, you know or know you see a metal show, so, i like being alone, but sometimes i want to go out with others, as you know i'm with people., crazy <laughter>, he thinks i'm.., i'm crazy because i got out of here., but, i guess he'd say i'm committed and i'm strong minded, and that you know what i imagined, i can do it, you know it, no matter what., how hard it is that i won't freak out, so, i mean, i really respect him for giving me his insight., but i guess, yeah, i guess he'd say that i, crazy, but, strong minded <laughter>, my children <sigh>, you know, this is the one thing that brings me joy that you know as real joy., are my children and, you know, having her in my life is the, the proudest thing i can ever achieve is that you know that she's, in my life, and even though i don't see her so much, even though i'm thinking of them, they're just thinking of you., how far they've gone, you know, what they have achieved in their you know, in her short time i mean anyway it makes me happy, and i can't wait to see her again, one of my most memorable experiences, i guess that would be, , in florida, you know to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch, it was a great night overall you know, one of the night i'll never forget, just because we were looking forward to you knowing so many months and, you know, when it finally happened, it was surreal., um, it was a great night after all and overall, sure that you are welcome, see you.",12
366,"yeah, that's good., i'm fine., and you, uh los close california, uh <sigh> i like the variety, i feel that l a alone is a country where there is so much to do to explore, and there is nothing like that., traffic <laughter> i'd say traffic and property prices are kind of crazy compared to the rest of the country, but unlike that, you know it's okay., i've traveled around i've traveled a bit, i'd like to travel more, but i've travelled to a few countries., i've been with you before., i will not say that europe is a continent, i was in london, i was born here, but my family is from nigeria, so i was in nigeria., a few times i was in denmark, um amsterdam, i was where else i went., um, and i think that's it, i think that's it yeah think that's it, yeah, that's good., simply explore uh explore <exp> discover new places to see new things that meet new people a different culture, it's definitely.., um, gives you appreciation for life, and the diversity of it and also go to countries that may not, how developed, how the u s it definitely gives you a greater appreciation for you know this country, yeah, that's good., okay well, uh, see london i accident actually when i first heard that i was going to london, i wasn't really interested because i didn't know much about it, the only thing i remember i remember, sees mary poppins <laughter> and around, but when i went there, i absolutely fell in love with him, just breathe., it still has the hectic pace of l a, but at the same time you can drive at a very slow pace around we have no we just, went on the tube, it's her way like the subway station i totally fell in love with., and, just to explore different parts of the city we went to know you large ben westminster abbey, in fact, when i went there, they had the premiere of, uh, what a movie that was., slumdog millionaire, and they also had the premiere for, seven seven pounds it was a movie with will schmied, they did it so that the blacksmith was over there, and we knew it., me and my friends were like screaming like we were like groupies <laughter> just you know, just knowing <laughter> just for antiques, but, um, it was a lot of fun it was a lot of fun, yeah, that's good., uh business management and an option in personnel management, which means i have no idea <laughter>, um, good question, i've always been, i've always wanted to go to business., and i've always wanted to study finance, but, i didn't think i'd learn too much about finance., college per se i think i've learned more in the real world, which is not, so the other option was human resource and i'm always fascinated that you know relationships and people always like to read articles about the stuff, so i went for the, no <laughter> well, i still kind of use what i've learned, but i work in real estate management, so, um.., it still has to do with people who have to do with people i'm fascinated by., so, yeah, that's good., that was a good.., my dream job wow, i'd say i'm a life coach., i would say that would be my dream job, because i love helping people to succeed and i help, i love it, part of someone else's success even not, no matter how small it is, whether it's words of encouragement or helping someone to find a situation, i like to help just how to help people have a better life, so i think uh, you know, but i'm doing it for free, i'd do it for free, like all day, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., more outgoing, in any case more outgoing i'm usually around, life is good it's strange because i'm usually considered the life of the party, i'm the one who cracks jokes and makes everyone laugh at the same time, i can be very, quiet and for me, so, yeah, that's good., right, <sigh> to relax, i usually listen to music, i usually listen to music to relax or i, pray, to relax or listen to some really quiet music, so, yeah, that's good., very good, very very good i used to uh, i wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but i was known for it., go off quote on quote <laughter> not in one not in one you know, don't throw chairs or something, but, i'm a very patient person., but once this patience <patien> is gone and for you to do that you really need to press my buttons for a long time and when it's finished i, i'm just going away., not mm mm, no, the last time i had a fight with someone i haven't had a fight with in a long time., to <sigh>, boy, mm, uh i argued with my, no, i'd say my father had a fight with him., um, about <sigh> what was it about, um, we disagreed on some things when we wanted to go back to nigeria., and, he didn't listen., it was a kind of group discussion, me and my siblings., and he was very subjective he was not open to other people suggestions and suggestions and concerns, so around it started an argument, very, uh, i wouldn't say angry at myself, but i felt very, it's like i lost control., i'm the guy where i like to have and feel control over my emotions and thoughts, as soon as this patience is gone and i start to run away, it's kind of like, this.., you know, i won't call it blurry, but, i'm very funny and fast with what i say so, i'll say something you know right away, until not necessarily hurting, but to very directly and to the point and i make sure that my point over, yeah, that's good., around i have three brothers one one younger two older i am very close to my family and my mother is one of my best friends, to <sigh>, my brothers are great around, love her to death, oh my father anyway he's more like that from the picture, yeah, that's good., i'm not really the culprit <laughter> i don't feel, guilty i am not to shy away from what i have done and i definitely own up to what i do, i am not a shy away from responsibility, but i don't think i'll ever feel, guilty, for everything i do, yeah, i don't think i feel like i don't usually feel guilty., yeah, that's good., pretty simple, to be fairly simple at <a> at <a>, yes, i'm pretty good at falling asleep except when i'm excited and when i read < laughter>, when i try when i'm, when i'm focused on something like learning, i'm going to read and read and read, even when it's past my bed, but now i'm trying to work on, wake up much earlier, then when i am now and this is kind of a fight <st> a bit of a fight, but i come to him so, good, um, i have the feeling i feel good, you know i'm generally i have a very happy disposition, and so, no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever i feel like i'm going, i won't allow myself to go to this place., nah, no, i'm sorry., thoughts, i'd say, well, it's i wouldn't say necessarily changes, but i would say moreso behaviors learn how to, let go of the past decisions, maybe and somehow how they played their course in my life, um, i just look back sometimes and say what if i had done what, how would life be now, no, so these are some games i play, but different from the, that's it., hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter>, regret, uh, no, no mm mm there is nothing i regret, ten to twenty years ago, i'd say you're not afraid of who you are, to be authentic, um, even more important with yourself, delete from my memory, uh, boy, that's a good one., hmm, uh, wow, delete from my memory, uh, i'd say when i told my father to behave like a father., maybe i shouldn't, yeah, there was.., that was actually one of the times i used to go around with him another time, uh, basically i had decided not to go to a private to not go away for college, so i decided to stay here so i could take care of my little brother., and around my senior year i was overloaded with everything i had maybe like, uh four a p classes, i worked at i worked three jobs at that time and i was also in track and field, so, needless to say, i was <laughter> i was kind of like burning myself, i was kind of like burning myself out., and, i was not good at a p calculus because i decided to go to a j c first and also transfer to save money for college, and when i told him that you know the teacher said i was going to fall asleep in class just because i was working an eight hour shift after school because i was a retail manager back then., so, um.., and i would come home after the shift to do homework mm calculus let alone, uhm so uh, he would get upset and i told him that i talked to my advisor, i already told him that i don't need this course to go to j c, is not something i'm going on with, so i just can't get off., at this point in time, so i'll just know,, you just know it, take the, d or fail whatever, and he didn't like it because he's a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's where it might have come from., and so, he started blaming like my jobs and wanted to call my boss and it was just too much and i told him, you know, since you're my father, you should act like that., but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> as i said it so, that was.., one thing, oh i really do i remember i regret one thing, and that's, i wish i'd keep going., to go with college in the whole, as if i burned myself out to spread myself too thin, i was actually on the right track to graduate from college., i'd like to say nineteen, because i started doing college classes in the high school early sophomore year, in high school, but i was working with this stuff and stuff with my dad and i kind of stopped working to school for a while and just worked, but i went back to finish so i wish i just had, continuation maybe that's a small thing, but, that's a little thing., yeah, that's good., hmm, i'm very, i am a very compassionate and understanding person, um, i like to learn new things around i'm a very happy person people come to me for advice i'm very objective, i'll tell you what's good, what's bad, what's ugly., and, yes, these are some of my best qualities yeah, and i'm fun i like to have fun i'm going to have fun in any situation i can make light out of any situation as i'm the type of person i can break the tension in space, the type of, this type of uh <tisk> around, personality, yeah, that's good., i wish i was bigger <laughter> around, except my size, hmm, i wish,, ah, maybe, i don't know if it's uh., be more, i won't say more in contact with my emotions, but i think, i'd say, understanding people is how people think about me in their shoes, i think that would be one thing because i'm the kind of person, where , people say they love me or take care of me and i'm okay great thanks i appreciate that, but i don't know how much, i think that's a realization of how much they care about me and love me., that's one thing i like, getting more, on a, take a look at this., <laughter> my best friend <deep breath> uh she describes me as someone funny, crazy, um, objective, to be loyal, ambitious hard work around, if i'm just kidding, she says you're so mean, but.., i just like it, i joke around all the time and all the way around, we just planned, uh, a friend of mine or a friend of ours to have a baby shower, i'll give her some ideas, and there's another friend who's been invited,, we've had some problems in the past, and someone i don't talk to or hang out with has always been very close to us, but i don't really talk to that person, but i don't mind them being there., so she also talked about celebrating her birthday, also at kind of like after the baby shower, and there's another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower, for whom we really didn't do anything, and i'm like good, if we celebrate this person's birthday, we could just as well definitely, you know, honor this person's birthday too, as we are closer to you know that the person birthday has passed, and i said you know exactly why we don't all celebrate birthday, <laughter> forget the baby shower just do the birthdays, and then that's when she said you were so mean <laughter> but she laughed about it so, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., of which i am very proud in my life <deep breath>, uh.., i would say to be there for my family., to be a spiritually and emotionally strong person, family has gone through a lot of challenges and many times i've been the one to make sure that, everything goes all right and everything ensures that everything goes all the way, so i'd say more than anything to make sure i was there for my family., yeah, that's good., oh, okay, thanks., bye, you got a good one.",0
367,"yes, i'm fine., i'm a little bit, thoughtful i guess a little, uh down, but, more or less okay, i was born in annapolis maryland, on the east coast, i originally moved because i went to film school., and then i decided to come i moved to washton d c to do some work and now i'm back here again, it's quite different to be from the east coast, it just has a different feeling than it.., but alive, l a is very has a very different kind of, um, attitude i think, and so it's a little difficult, but i, but i've gotten more used to it since i got here., uh, not at all.., when i left things, things were kind of, i lost my job out there, so i had to move out of here quickly to.., to be together, a few people who wanted to help me and i'm just kind of, i don't know if alienated is the right word, but i'm just kind of, not really talk to my family or old friends who often, it's not easy, it's, it's kind of.., i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job, i miss some friends., i miss a lot of relationships i had out there, so it's difficult, i mean, it weighs a lot on my mind, i feel like i've failed., and now i'm here and i don't seem to get back on my feet, so it's hard, depends on the situation, i think i'm going out when i feel comfortable., and then i'm out extremely, but when i'm in a situation, i don't feel comfortable with me tending to be much shyer, so that doesn't really answer your question, but, um, um.., i'm sure,, i do a lot of writing, i'm sure,, music i hear, how i write and when i can, if i really can get into that and somehow can turn off the rest of the world around the music and the thoughts somehow, it's really happening.., it can calm me it's like it's when i feel the most relaxed i think, um, a few weeks ago, i guess i was working on a book about one about a novel., and when i was real, when i really wrote it and.., it really worked for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was reaching something and i felt really relaxed, um, it was about a, guy who's looking for, something it is, it's his last day on earth, and so he'll find a person he'll be looking for., that he or she , and only, was so impressed that he had to find her and spend the last minutes he had with her on earth just because, it's kind of romantic., adventure comedy kind of thing, well, i always did i was always a writer part of the reason why i came to l a was because of writing the script, so i wrote some scripts and uh, you know, had a little success with that out here and but since then i've been kind of tired of the boundaries of the script and i've started to write more short stories and and longer, only creative writing so, i wanted to write a novel, but i was just waiting for the idea, to really beat me, it's not just the breathing out , parts parts, if it is good, it is really good, but it is sometimes a real fight for, i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i love it when i just love it absolutely but sometimes i, hate it because it's so difficult, um, but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good, good i have not i have not really a temperament i, it's not i mean most of my anger i have is directed inward, unlike outwards to other people, if something is really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can, lose, but i probably < try> that's probably just happening to me three four times in my whole life i mean in general i mean pretty much, try it when i'm angry, i'm not getting mad with myself with other people, um, last night i guess well <weh>um, i was arguing about whether or not., cleaning of vegetables was necessary because, i forget it but it was good no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i had already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay, so it became this, great argument and we have google searches to find out who was right and who was wrong and i, i was wrong about this one at the end, but, it's, yeah, it wasn't, it was an exploding argument, but it was a definite argument., um, uh, so much.., uh, i was in a relationship that i really, um, that i really wanted to work, and, uh, i landed and it was partly on, i wasn't on i wasn't on the right medication and so i went, like everything that was torn out of a spiral., control and i feel really guilty about the way that ended and i mean, i wasn't, i wasn't mean, but i was, but i got messed up more and more, and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i really feel guilty about not doing enough and not, and you know she has to tell me she never wanted to see me again., so, that was nice, that was pretty hard, well, some of it was that, i was not properly meditated, i mean, now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that, i mean, i'm still getting, i'm still getting upset and getting depressed, but it's not like it's not, i don't lose it all for days at once, um, so, i mean, i know there's a part of me that logically knows that it wasn't all my fault, and that if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain, then i would probably have been different if i was who i am now., i would have done it if i were., i'd be, it would probably have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have been, but i mean, i could, i don't know if i could have done anything else., things as they were, i mean, it's, it's possible uh, i mean obviously, yeah, because i mean, that's what i'm doing., i mean, i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until, until it makes me crazy, i stay on things, um, and it's like every little detail that comes, i suddenly remember and it can just throw me away for a whole day i still mean, i'm still getting, i'm still getting really uncomfortable and barricaded and then ashamed of things i did in high school, that was years ago and years ago i shouldn't even think about it because it's in the past, but i still get the feeling that i'm right there, well, it's not, just i've been trying to figure out how to deal with it i mean with him for a long time through, by drinking and you know, just try to slow down my mind this way, but since the medications it's better, it wasn't impossible to deal with, it wasn't easy, but it's, but it's been better, like i said, i'm doing a lot, do you know when i write or when i do something like i almost have to do it?, do two things at once to completely occupy my brain, when i see t v, i have to play a game on my phone when i use the computer, i have to be., you know, a t v show or a movie about you know, in another window, so i just, keep my mind busy during all this, um, i just need, i mean,, i wish i could just let the thoughts come and deal with them, but i just can't yet, they're triggered by everything., pretty much everything i see when i, if i, when i hear someone with a dutch last name, when i hear someone talking about wisconsin, when i hear that you know people are talking about it., only, everything you know, i can get back and connect, to, to this it is really it is really, i don't know that this is the thing i mean, i never get a break, from him, yeah, that's good., um, i don't know that i'm a very light sleeper, so i.., awake and sleep and awake and sleep <asl> i have no problem sleeping again but i generally, you know you don't know., i don't know that i never really needed much sleep., it's just recently that i've really started to like the effects of not feeling enough sleep, as i would usually stay up to two or three in the morning so i could just be so exhausted that i could just wake up the next day and feel good going to work, but now it's like i can't, that i still can't get enough sleep, i don't think i'm still sleeping very easily., you know, i get up and turn around all night., you know it and now, it's just, it's, yeah, i'm not sleeping too well now., um, pretty i mean, i don't know, it's hard, it's hard to know, i usually just some kind of power through them and just, i'm how i am now, i just feel, bad, um, i think, about three three four years ago, um, it was when i, i had given to take things for fear for, for, years before, but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you really did., this, situation and we need you to work on the medications you are not you need to like on these new medications that actually start, even you and heal yourself a little bit of all this, so yes, that was kind of a turning point, but unfortunately, it happened after everything went wrong., i don't know., the moment i don't know that i don't really think i thought about it, too much then, but looking back at it, i feel, it really makes me, angry it makes me really you know where i am right now it makes me really angry that i am, that i had to lose everything because, for, chemicals in my brain for things i couldn't control, and that you know that the people who were supposed to help me didn't help me, i mean, i paid, i paid a lot of money to go to doctors, and they did, and they knew it wasn't., it didn't help, it didn't work until, until, you know, i found someone who worked and i'm just yes, so i'm like thank you guys for the help, but, it was a little bit late now, um, there was really no choice i had to be i was i was a mess i was, it was either, i was meditating myself it influenced my work i mean it was all just at a point where i really realized that i meant i just had to do this differently, but again it was too late because you know, then my review came a few months later and you know, after, after all, after having institutionalized one or two times and all the stuff you know they just decided that i just didn't worth it so they let me go, but it was at least, that and not, fires me, but yes, but that's how i got help, but it was, but it wasn't early enough, uh not, not as much as i should, um, i'm going to a couple, meetings, i'm going to a a so that i, to know you also keep control of this aspect <t> and there is one aspect of therapy that, unfortunately, you know you're unemployed., my unemployment ran out of you know i'm you know i'm my meds from the city l a so, you know, i'm not really able to see money, someone, so i have a psychiatrist i see, but it's really, very, i only saw her three times last year., it's basically to let my medications come, and then there's you <laughter>, right, like i said, i mean, just the speech <tah> i mean, the ones we just take the a a for example, because that's probably the next <cloth> closest for what i see with the therapy for now, just to say what's silent is just.., how to get this stuff out, try to figure out how to make this mess in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and phrases that make sense, with which you can actually deal, is a big step like, regardless of who , you tell me if it's a therapist or just a room full of drunks, you know, i mean, you take all this, things that really killed you, and you make it something that you can handle something that you can write down what you can do., talk about in contrast to just let it sit there only as this formless thing, yeah, that's good., um, you know better than me when i was., it's kind of, it goes <g> it has its ups and downs, i'm applying for a job., five six jobs, or more a day you know and never get an answer that never gets an interview, never get any closer, to be self sufficient again, um, it's hard, but that's like real world problems i feel, how the chemical parts get under control, how the depression gets under control, so now it's just i have to deal with the real life, that's, it just has its own it's just its own challenge, yeah, that's good., um, it was probably you know a few years ago, um, i was, i mean the thing that comes to mind right away, uh, is, everything went well at my job i made these great videos with this person i had a relationship with and we were really close, we had fun together, and we went out and got a christmas tree, and, we spent all the time choosing the perfect christmas tree and it was just, feeling like a part of someone's life, and feel like part of the larger, the greater life, that's the one out there that you know how normal people feel, you know for this moment that i felt like, a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl he really liked and, you know everything went well and, i mean, it didn't go really well because it was all messed up, but for that moment i felt like a normal person, a normal happy person, and, part of what makes it so difficult now is to know that, i don't know if i'll ever feel that again., so, um, probably the, this is likely to be the, education <educary> education series i got uh, a pedagogical, uh video series i did for the national science foundation, um, it was, it was really hard and it was, but in the end it became really good and, you know, i hope it helps a lot of kids, and it helps the world get kids excited about science, and.., and about the world around it, so i felt that this was a real contribution i made to, the world, oh, it was part of you that it was part of my job., it was a, we tried to come with, with new ideas uh, because we'd be together videos and things you know, to schools and everything and they had done before, but we decided to do something really big, you know, and there were a lot of trips, and there were a lot of trips around, and there was a lot to him and so, it was probably the biggest, project that the n s f had decided to do and so we just produced it somehow, right, that doesn't yeah, um, i guess.., i don't know <laughter> uh, i don't know, it's been a while since i've really been thinking that i don't know, would i go somewhere i, i don't know., thank you.",19
368,"yeah, i'm fine with that., i'm fine., i guess.., , i'm basically a guy, cool, um, you know, the weather it's usually pretty sunny and temperate you know, i really like the climate a lot, i like the girls you know here., i like to see, i don't like the traffic you know, but, i like the hispanic population pretty well., and i have a lot of friends here, so i guess you know i don't want to be anywhere else, i mean, like i said, the traffic you know i was on the four on five, you know, that's always kind of you know crommy, the cost of living you really know, terrible about l a it's always expensive, and, you know i don't like it., i really don't like you knowing them., as it seems like to l a's one of those places where you are you know that you either know like one, a ton of money and fame and fortune or as you know that you know below in which you know the ghettos you are, i've been to a few places., uh, you know, but very briefly, you know, it was mostly for school., i went to arizona and new york and montana a lot of anthropology as you know and archaeology field trips and such things, uh, nothing i'm doing right now, i like to get away from the city that you know i was in yosemite last year you know summer for vacation that was kind of nice you know yosemite was really around, really nice to see, but uh just basically getting away from the city i guess you know away from work getting away from the stress here, uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics around, i'm a great kind of policy you know junkie you know to start with, so i naturally somehow fell in line with this type of study, it was me, but i lost my job., and you know that's kind of a moron that you know i lost it., oh, my god!, it's been a year and a half, now maybe two years and a half., um, you know that the economy got bad and budget cuts got bad, and you know i wish i'd work there again., uh, i wanted to be a lawyer, and i wanted to be a lawyer., and so i took political science and i took a double major in economics, and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i regret is that i know anyway you know to get into law school, you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats, and i studied for it how really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the test and like an idiot around i didn't feel right about the day it was a kind of day off, and you know, it was like you know the big game at the superbowl that you know, that i just don't feel like i did it well and i canceled the test and all that around, you know, i kind of regret that you know, <laughter> tell me about it, i'm not really shy, i'm definitely not shy., but starting i don't mean one of these people <peo> i'm not flamboyent you know i'm going to talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind, i'm meeting people who are good with me, but it's not like you know i'm dying to meet someone., i guess.., around these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar, um, i know i should have done more of it., but i also like to exercise around uh i'm on a diet right now, but my diet was terrible time eating habits were terrible, but the exercise part is just great i love to train <exerci> i love to run, this is one of my best things to do for stress is how to run and how to train, i just wish my eating habits were in line uh or a little better you know,, to <sigh> my temperament you might know definitely improved uh a lot you know to, you know many times i feel i'm one of those introverted guys people when it comes to how you know that i don't mind being extroverted or meeting people and like having a good time, whatever, when i'm angry, i really don't want you to talk to people i don't like screaming, i don't like screaming, i don't like beating, i don't like fighting, i kind of close up a lot, i don't just want to be left alone, sometimes i tend to put it on longer than it should be, you know, the woman doesn't like it too much, and maybe i know i just don't want to talk about it <laughter> i just don't want to deal with it., i kind of shut down and shut down, you know?, switch off for a little bit, oh, my god!, um, you know it doesn't happen too often., maybe with my wife, you know that we were probably something stupid that knows, who knows?, um, the, i mean, i don't have a lot of guilt, i'm not doing anything to make me feel like you know a person you know is bad., there are things that, as you know, i call minor sins, you know, i get white lies or whatever you know, but nothing like so disgusting that makes me feel guilty., um, let's see, i guess,, sometimes you know., you know, i'm a married guy, but i know sometimes there are times you know i like it, you know you're smiling at a girl, or, as you know, you're getting a girl's attention, you know, i don't know that i never go, i never do anything about it, i never get her phone number or as you know, but, sometimes i like it, talk to people, i guess, you know, that's a good question., i guess.., i guess you know i always do the same thing, there's not that i never want to change, i never want to deal with things differently, i'm always pretty comfortable how i deal with things and you know i think i could be much worse and as you know, screaming and screaming and beating and that and that and that and that, and that's just not me, you know, i think the best you know is kind of like, get a lot of breathing space a lot of space and around i don't want that to change or treat any of it differently i just don't basically know what else to do, you know., and you know, the last thing i want to do is talk about feelings, or talk about anything that you know that's the last thing i want to do, and like i don't want me to treat something like that differently., you know, i'm pretty happy with my family now, you know, if i'm married and we have a baby on the way, which is kind of beautiful, around we have a few cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and around my mother i love my mother intimately, um, she has diabetes that she doesn't control., you know, she doesn't control it and likes it how uh it affects her health and it always worries me about her and how stress about her and she could do so much to prevent it and she doesn't and, i have a good relationship with my mother, i love her very much and i really have a good relationship with everyone i think, i think i've got a ton of family and friends around, who get along pretty well with me, you know actually, yeah, that's good., there are times that are good. i mean, it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep. i feel like you know i'm sleeping like a baby., the only problem i have, i think, is i feel, how you know sometimes how you fall asleep and you're just going to sleep and you're kind of like a yolk you know how you almost like a case, anyway it's like a falling feeling or something, and it doesn't happen so often, but it happens, and around but for most of the time <ti> part by no i sleep like a stone i sleep really well, well, right now, i've felt in general., worry and and fearful and, you know, uh, and tense and the reason why is because i said my mom to right, at least today, well, i found out that my mother did something that she didn't tell me the whole story, and i kind of wait until this is over so we can figure out what's wrong with her., but.., you know, i'm worried about her, she's in the hospital, she's with the doctors right now, so that doesn't tell me anything good., and to you know to try to find a job, so that also got me worried, and you know the baby on the way, so i got worried, so i feel like a sharp inhalation you know, overwhelmed with a just a lot of how you know how to do things and how, and, much on my much on my plate and how much of it has nothing to do with me, but i have to treat it the way you know, the way i think, well, i keep distracted i keep myself busy i feel like a busy body you know, and the more it seems like you know it seems like it's not a good thing because i feel i'm just adding more things on my plate, so, um, you know how one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to train every day that you know, but that takes an hour, as you know, change and you just start to run and how to go through the whole thing of stretching and cooling, which takes some time and then like to shower, all the kind of stuff takes time, so i have to do it every day so that i can finish it this way, i also finished knowing you're playing guitar, but that only, more of a distraction that you know what i mean, keep you know to keep busy as it seems simple as if it wasn't, you know to work towards you, know the goals, you know i have to do as you know i can find a job i should do, but then.., you know, it's one of those things where i don't think there's any good jobs i've been looking for and looking for, and sometimes when i do, it's just not what i want to do, it just doesn't seem, for example , <laughter> as i want uh, make one of these like terrible jobs, i xx it's you know it's it, probably harder than i think about it, because sometimes i feel like, you know, one of these things is like, uh.., i feel like it's hard, but it's not i mean, there are ways to deal with it, you know, i kind of have to accept that you know that i sort of internalized it., and how uh you know, it's not something that's like i'm not out on the street or something like that, but you know it's a concern., i've never diagnosed with p t s d i worked with., no, no, man, ten years ago, <laughter> i don't know, uh, see, the last time i was really happy maybe, i mean nothing, i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know i learned to feel a new song on the guitar <fe> i feel like, i'm not even happy that you know i'm like.., you know, i work sometimes and that makes me happy that you run as fast as you know, but that doesn't make me so excited or anything., i just feel good., you know, so i have this this, in those times when i'm just you know i'm feeling good, about me and i feel, you know, but i never feel great i never feel happy i never feel as sensational as you know and you know it, i can't believe you know it's just.., you know there are these mild times when there are some good times., you know and a few bad times, but the good times are never <n> never <ne> never extremes, you never know really good times and never really terrible bad times you know, well, i wish this diet would work a little better you know, but that's kind of hard you know because i like the kind of guy that just likes, who likes you to know about you, rice and how uh mexican food and how <sharp inhalation> you know to and to snack and uh, i don't know, i just feel like i could change i wish i could change my eating habits as i can, as you know, because i'm learning so much that i feel like i'm running as much and doing as much activity as you know., that if i mean you know diet in check around, you know this would go a long way, i wish i could change you, too., my <m> my, my uh, i guess my, i feel like the economy is so bad., and how things are so rough that, you know, it's like pointless, even if you know looking for this kind of jobs like, it just seems like i just wish i had a little more inspiration to like a lot more motivation, to <laughter>, <sigh> does things, the one thing i regret is not, is not to you know is this lsat thing you know about, you know, i can't cancel the test to start it, because i'm sure i could have gone to a school, but then, as you know, it made me think that i really want to pay a bunch of how you know law school and the cost of it and how, you know, just to.., just to be stacked with more work and so on anyway, i don't know it just doesn't seem like, how uh, i mean, there's an idea of justice and, and around and republicanism, and you know things that i really know you, stick to, that i fall in love with, and that i don't want to get away, but it seems like it's a lot of work and money., and easy to like it for the small percent of success,, that you know that maybe you don't really make such a field that you might know that maybe i just don't like, it's worth overcoming the obstacles i have to overcome, ugh < sigh>, i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wu> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe, um, you know, i think i've done everything really well for myself, except for the lsat thing you know which i'm going to do., you know the regrets on one side on the other, you know, i'm not sure i regret it because of the bills and all the stuff i told you about,, and you know, i think you know that i was waiting to get married, that i was waiting for a kid., i've known you pretty carefully about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these things like things like you know that, i think that real people know,, and then she really as you know ruin her life you know like, i'm pretty happy and satisfied with, you know the godfearing whom you know., uh, i don't know., oh, my best friend, i think he kind of likes me <li> he likes me he wants me to do more things with him, but he works at night, and you know it's one of those things i think most people not only have my best friend, but my wife and maybe the rest of my family., feel that i don't put much, time and attention to them i mean, they think i'm pretty great when i give them the, time of the day and my attention, but i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know, i don't know if i'm real, you know, i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something else, i don't know if i can really give them a real one., you know, shoulder to cry, or you know, if you ask for something you know, i'll usually do it., you know, but i almost feel like it's like a job, like you know, like she's.., you know, if they really need me, then i'll do it, you know, if they're just asking for a favor, i almost feel like you know i'm doing it., i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate them or anything i really like, it's just that i have the feeling, i almost don't want to say that i owe it to them, but the mere fact that i'm her boyfriend somehow makes her.., you know, uh, as i do it anyway makes me, as you know, they rely on me some you know times or how i don't want to let them down they're my friends, but it's the same time, i just feel like it's, it's more it's not it's not it's more like doing a job instead of a job., a willingness like an oh my god, as i just want to help you, it's never <ne> it's never that it's just something i do because i somehow have to know you need to know, i have to do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know, and i end up like them, and they'd probably do it for me., and i know you, so i just.., well, there are a few things i like that i have good <go> i feel good about myself you know, you know i ran the marathon that feels good., i graduated from college that feels good, you know what i mean, but the thing is, i don't feel that way., like pride in myself, because you know these things alone, like studying from college, you know i didn't really succeed, you know what i mean., um, running the marathon didn't make me thin and trim, so they're like half the merits, you know, or how they are, they're great, you know, lotta people may not have done half way, a lot of people have gone beyond each other., but.., you know, they're kind of like kickstones that like, that around i seal real new no, life < l>lifelong, benefit from other than the fact that i can say that i have done, yeah yeah no problem no problem thanks for your time you know to hope you enjoy you know uh in this computer, oh, goodbye., i'm gonna press this button now",7
369,"sure, yes, thank you for asking me., you know how about yourself, oh awesome, i'm from guatemala., my parents moved here to the united states when i was three years old., so yes., mhm, yeah, it's pretty cool, you know., i haven't been there yet, but i haven't been to my hometown yet., for ages, uh just you know i have all my family here my mother my father my cousins aunts uncle so, i've got my life here, so i'm probably, i mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know it's just my curiosity that you don't know, i guess., oh, all right., i love the people who are all nice, i love the variety you know, there are different types of, people and you know the imagination out there everything is just great, you know everyone's different, you know nobody's like him, at least on some aspects., um, and i love the landscape i love, the mountains they're beautiful., you know, good for hiking you know, take the dog know the family you know, it's nice, it's pretty active yes, uh the smog <laughter>, i don't like smog, it's just.., you know, if you keep going, you know you can see it in the air you know, or, you know everything is clear the sky is blue <laughter> but different from that, as you know and traffic <laughter> no one likes traffic i think,, yeah, that's good., yeah, but.., yeah, you know that pretty much l a is pretty nice you know it's i like it, um, well, i just studied, you know, i'm not exactly sure what i want to be, so it's just kind of knowing about you, here and there you jump through tires and so, not really, it's just that i'm still trying to find my interests, i suppose., so, my dream job hm, that's a good one., i love working with kids, so i'd say probably a child psychologist just because you know it's great., you know what's going on in the young minds, and you know how we can help kids find a better way, you know, kids make you know or help, you know, help them you know growing in a positive way i thought instead of going the wrong track, yeah, that's good., all i know is that you're helping kids., it's important that it depends on the situation i'm in, sometimes you know that i could be like super going and just like you know, and sometimes like it just i could be quite calm or something not and just make sure you know if i'm like in class or whatever, i don't really like it and there's everyone talking i just would prefer it just to, stay away from what you know, because i need something else to focus on something else you know there's a moment and time for everything i take, yeah, that's good., um, i like to kick my feet on the couch and enjoy reading a good book you know., you know, i'm going to see someone else., galaxy or universe or, situation you know it's pretty funny that you just know, you know, read and then just, feel relaxed and you know that you feel good, yeah, it's just fun i love reading, um, i'm not the best you know., you know, i'm trying my best, and i guess that's all i could do until i keep, better work at the end, but i'm not like the best, i mean, sometimes i have my outbursts you know., but you know, i guess that's all., i'm not sure haha you know, uh huh, that's a good question., in order to , i don't remember <laughter> uh let's see uh, honestly, i don't remember, maybe, uh, oh, my god., i don't know, <laughter> i sometimes i'm very passive that i just let go like things, because i mean, what's the point of making a big thing out of things, you know it so.., i don't know., i'm not i can't be honest i can't tell you that <laughter> at this moment, sure yeah probably come back to it, um, what are you doing?, well, i guess,, when i was younger, i knew i could have been a better older sister and i wasn't, and that makes me guilty for sure, you know i could have been a better sister., better role model <laughter> you know, but i'm trying to do my best now, so i'm trying to do things better., and it works <laughter>, yeah, that's good., i guess, huh?, hm, i don't know, i mean, i am the person i am because of the events that have happened in my life, so, if i delete something, it's just something from me in my present self or you know that would change and, i don't know, i'm pretty okay with the person i'm now i mean, you know, i don't think i'd change an event., you know, i'm fine with what, they know ups and downs and good and bad that happened, so, yeah, that's good., i can't see your shoes, but i don't travel much., but i'm kind of like a explorer i think i love how to explore, even the smallest things, like when i walk, i walk away and you know, i find my way up, you know it somehow, and you just do it., you know to travel, i'd like to do that, but.., i don't know, only you know., always circumstances in my life, which, you don't always know something that you know i'm marrying children you know and all that, so it's kind of the way you know it, it'd be nice, i guess you know, it'd be nice, you know, i love camping, the way you know it takes a few days out there camping and you know fishing <laughter> yeah, um, uh it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice, it was just me and he you know, and it was like nobody and it was like nice because it was just in the middle of the forest with a beautiful lake and, you know, it was really nice., it's just yeah, yeah, that's good., yes yes it was it was it was really fun it was like i'd like to do it again, you know right now., it would be great, you know, just going out there it's just i love the adventure of things and nature and just life and you know overall, yeah, that's good., uh, it's easy, but lately i haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because, i don't know, just you know that i'm lying there and i'm just trying to sleep and i'm just like ugh, but at some point i do <laugher> you know, i just like it probably need to be, position me on another side of the bed as sometimes i'm in the headboard and i'm like ah i have to go to the other side and, once i've positioned myself, i'll just go to sleep., but i have to find the right position for myself., yeah, that's good., um, i'm tired <laughter> i get tired all day, but, i'm trying to shake it off, you know, and just like that, feel like a new day you know and just try to make the day i have as big as possible, you know and then try to like it by sleeping at night, the day of <laughter> you know, so yeah, it's just, you know, it's okay, i'm trying to do the best, i think., if not, then i just go to sleep all day sucking, of course., uh no <laughter>, no, i felt good., yeah, i feel really good., you know a lot of things in my life you know that i've got a really good year so far, so i'm very happy with that you know everything is, you know how good you are, you know, yes, it is, except that i just came out of a cold and it was terrible, but, this is just nature <laughter> my immune system must work harder <laughter>, yeah, that's good., to super happy was uh, when the doctor told me i was pregnant, you know that i, really really happy about it and i was just like ah you know that was really good you know, very excited and just reading what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and, oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time < laughter> i never really like uh you know, but yeah, i've been very happy, uh, um, i don't know, i guess just myself, i, uh, you know how, you know, i could know that you're just me, and that's what you know, but i can't really, you know, say, i have certain thing i think i mean, it depends on the person who meets me, to tell me i can't really tell myself how oh i am that i am that only you know, just try to be my best and try to tell me something good for other people, tell me, or you know compliment me or what not, yeah, that's good., um, <laughter> nothing i think <laughter>, as i said, i am happy with the person i am just, and you know my mistakes or what you know, i could have every mistake people see in me, and it's okay, you know i'm okay with it., whatever it is right now, i'm not gonna do it., i can't change for other people's preferences <laughter> i only have one body and one life so yeah, yeah, that's it., uh, only my childhood with my sisters and my family, but, you know you know you're learning from it., you learn from the past and you feel like hey you know, maybe i should be a better role model that you know for my kids and so my kids could be better models so the world could only improve., um, only smile and be happy, you know, whatever hard things happen, you know you're gonna get through them someday., the only thing you can't do., i don't know you can't., you know, you know, you might know the heartache, or it's whatever, but you know, as long as i'm alive, i still have to go on., yes <laughter>, um, i don't know., that's pretty., huh most proud of, i guess i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know i'm, you know, i'm trying to be, you know, a better person every day and try to like, you know, improve yourself every day, as much as i can, you know, that would probably be something i could be super proud of., as much as i can, very hard <laughter> i won't lie about it is really hard, you know, because i can't say that you know it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good you know,, and you know it's always challenges and everything you know in your life, but, you know it only happens sometimes., you know, hard you know, and sometimes it comes easy you know, after a while you get a lot of exercise and all is how you have a great day and you haven't even tried < laughter> you know,, so yes., um, you know, loving friendly around you know adventurous i guess i don't know, i guess that's what they say <laughter> i just know you know that they like, you know, but that's what i'm at least trying to be, at least you know i'm trying to, always give a best foot forward, as much as possible you even know, sometimes, even if i'm having a hard day, i'm just like you know., you know, i just don't want to take it out on anyone or anything you know., yeah, that's good., around <laughter> my ideal weekend, usually i like to go to the park, i sit like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree, where there are shadows and how, my blanket out there has my dog and, how to read a book and you know sometimes, if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them, so that's pretty nice, you know., just sit there and just the air and the, noise, i guess because there's no silence, knowing the wind and the cars, and you know it's just great., yeah, that's good., awesome, thank you for being welcome <laughter>, see you.",0
370,"yeah, that's good., thank you for asking me how you're doing., i grew up from here in l a in the san fernando valley, yeah, that's good., uh <sigh> well, i like the variety of people the different types of food that you can eat i like to, the outdoor opportunities that i grew near the hills, so i did a lot of hiking around, camping is pretty close to i have snowboarding around i like, the familiarity i think and you know it's a big city and you know i'm pretty familiar with living here for so long that, i'd say i like that too, uh the long commuting also you know for short distances around, and then you know it gets really hot in the summer sometimes so you know, that before i could bear to be a little bit cooler when it comes to its peak heat, but, that's all right., wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a big question i <laughter>, i think my dream job would probably uh you know maybe be able to travel and somehow, make money out of him profit from him you know do business of traveling, but, it's almost an unrealistic dream, because i don't know if i would really do that, but if i did,, if i had to choose some kind of dream existence, you know that travel is paid to meet new people and try new things., and able to make a living out of it would be pretty funny, well i like as i mentioned what i like about l a i like to try different types of food different kitchens, so i think authentic cuisine in different places to try and meet different types of people who would see different ways of life uh, anyway, what i like about traveling around i like to experience new things around, i think that would be nice, you know, although the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l a there is also, fun in discovering new things, so i think traveling <tr> when i travel, that's what i like to do, just check out new things around, so i'd like you to know if i could live with doing that would be great, uh one of my trips okay well let's see the last, travel i i, taken to, lemmi think of a <on> yet an exciting journey around, now my family is from eastern europe, so one of the trips i made with my parents when i was 14, i was too, austria hungary and romania and uh you know that some of these old castles to see <ca> i was a couple of times before, but i was when i was little, so i didn't really remember too much and i didn't really do things quite the same as when i was a little older, so i need to see that you know that my family is old and you know the hometown that you know we have a family., for example , tomb so i got to see that then only these old buildings and only the other kind of life, i really liked that you know to see my parents old friends, you know, and, so that was pretty funny it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from me, my home environment, you know, i went in the middle of the school year, so it was like going to america suburban from you., travel through type of uh you know with these old trains and see these castles and these old as well as hundreds of years old cities and, i don't know if it was for everyone you know, i don't know if it would be great for everyone, but i really enjoyed it, uh that's a good question i'm doing <sigh> uh i'm probably one of the things i'm doing is either turn on like a repeat of a sitcom used to i to make the office much so, i kind of know when this is on, so i'm gonna do this, that you know, just some kind of zone from a little too uh you know how, familiar characters and and hear jokes that are still funny for some reason or around, maybe how to eat a little comfort food you know i'm not trying to eat too much fast food at all, but uh, as in n' out i really like going there, so if i need to relax you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that, uh or i really like to read it around especially like uh i'll read the events of the day you know that this really, relaxes me for some reason, even if it reads about something that is going on somewhere in the world a conflict is going on, i will still read the headlines and, i really like to know what is on this kind of centers me around so i really enjoy that this is something i do to relax, i'd say i'm pretty good at it, although i don't think my nature makes it pretty easy <eas> that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i'm not getting very excited <up> excited about just so, it's not a big challenge to control my temper., yes, i don't know <do> i don't really have anger problems i it's difficult for me to get angry, uh so i don't, i don't really have much trouble with that., the last time i argued with someone was probably <sigh>, i don't even know that i have my little disagreements that you know i'd have uh with family or friends about, things, but just a full argument i can't even remember that it's been years since i didn't really argue too much, i'm trying to avoid conflicts, as much as possible in my personal life, really see something to be won, and i kind of uh naturally repell away from him, so i don't, i'm sorry i don't have much to say about arguments., something that i feel guilty about saying that you sometimes know that i'm anyway sometimes i don't really care about, i have the feeling that i may not have made the most of my potential in life i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot around, i feel like i'm getting more and more ways out there that we miss i feel like you know sometimes downtime i feel a little guilty about it because there's always something i could do that i'm not, even if it's just the laundry i took out of the dryer that's sitting there, or, i run late, i really don't like running late, although it happens more than i'd like and i don't know why i feel guilty that i don't like to keep people waiting, wait because it feels like you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs, which is obviously not true, um, uh, um, uh.., for nothing comes to mind immediately, now <sigh> the last car accident i got in i, it was a few years ago i think i wish it hadn't happened that i wish i could have deleted it from my memory, but i anyway, was, i thought the cars in front of me would go, you know, at least for a little you know, ten fifteen feet, but it turns out that they had stopped them, so it was a < deep breath> you know slowly, heck end collision, but it was still very unhappy, i was just uh you know it felt like i was watching a second and in the next second you know i was just like, to reach something in the passenger seat and then i banged in front of me in the car and deep breath uh i wish that hadn't happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a little thing, but, it was just really unhappy timing it was very bad you know for me financially and the people i got into an accident were fine, but i was <wa> you know they, you know you didn't ask for anything but to repair the damage, but it was just terrible timing., i wish that hadn't happened., it sucks <laughter> it has sucks i'm about it now but anyway it does suck, well, i'm a pretty good sleeper i though i'm of course wired to later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job to allow me to get a fairly flexible schedule, but on the same token uh, i wish i could <cou> were like hard wired to go to sleep earlier because i just end up staying on, until one or two every night uh and, it's just too late, you know, even if i'm a full eight hours or what's not sleeping it's not always at night, you know that half of my sleep is like in the kind of early daylight hours and i wish i was, more than, able to sleep you know going to sleep like ten or eleven, and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to, go to sleep later and wake up later, i feel pretty good, i didn't complain physically, and you know i feel good., you know my relationships with my family and friends are good., around everything is great so far i have absolutely no real complaints uh as far as i feel about myself or anything, no, no, i was pretty much in line with my behavior and my thoughts that i think to, everything was pretty okay pretty stable no nothing traumatic nothing about somehow a resurgence from the past nothing like that has happened or happens, no, no, well, i think there are a lot of things that everyone regrets, yes, there are many things about <sigh>, in my life uh yeah as i said i, i regret uh you know maybe don't try harder in my younger days you know i, there's a period of time in my early twenties where i didn't work for a while i just uh, i was hanging out with a lot of friends you know, i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked just uh you know we, we got high every day or it seemed like i don't know every day that it was just.. eh, but it was some kind of throwaway time in my life., i would say that to <sigh>, it's important, to deal with the world, i think i think i've let something out of the world, a bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to, recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what kind of potential you know future activities you can expect from, the people you're dealing with, i think i'd say that.., somehow trying to focus on what i wanted to do with my life instead of just thinking well you know that things will work,, after all, they do, but i think you know that it's lost a little time with this.., the approach is somehow fatalistic, and i think that i would say that you know to just try to concentrate you know that you don't know that not everyone works according to the same schedule and life is not a race, but i would say that, it was important to have a goal in mind or a kind of, you know idea for what you want from life as opposed to just waiting somehow and to think that things are falling in place, to <sigh>, good i <sigh>, i guess when people don't give me much, take even constructive criticism especially well for some reason i think that for < f> at least for me i've somehow figured things out, although i'm sure i'm wrong that, so i just think in terms of how uh group work i've done professionally or academically you know when some of my work is, sorted or tested, i don't do well, and i take it personally when i should., uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh someone with much less experience < exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to pass it and it was someone, just from college you know., went beyond what we had done and, you know, it was just some kind of rewording things and it just seemed like cosmetic changes that were made just to change things and, i took some personal insult that just because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh, it was unnecessary for you to know that i thought this whole thing was a waste of time, and you know that i just.., i didn't think she was someone who was qualified to repeat all our work, or even to uh, not to repeat, but to edit or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofreading i think to make any kind of, you know, qualitative changes i just thought it was a really bad idea, and i thought i knew you shouldn't have seen it that way, but i thought that, the fact that they brought in someone with almost no experience you know was an affront to us who had been working on this project, but, you know it wasn't our call., mm most memorable experiences around, well, i guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my.., the first real trip i took from me uh i i took the uh the amtrak to new mexico and i was out there exploring things around, for about ten days alone uh so that was somehow the longest, period of time up to this point and i was in my i was i don't know, twenty three maybe at the time that i, i was really on my own from all i was in parts of the new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time., and it was very memorable because i felt on it on my own i was like i was really uh you know the things i wouldn't have seen if i had travel companions around and it was a lot of fun, uh good i was very happy recently i was getting married in a couple of months uh i got engaged on the day of work uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i was uh that was a very happy day of this whole process you know to meet someone and we, we went very fast and recognized where we were, so i was a pretty man., i think we got engaged and then we shared it with our family., very happy times around new years was happy you know, uh i'm in a happy period of my life at the moment so, yeah, that's good., yes, thank you <laughter>, uh <sigh> with a <sigh> type of, sense of humor that maybe not everyone gets i'd say uh also uh, you know., helpful rest maybe relax uh <sigh>, intelligent, you know i like to recycle, that's something they'd say., i, what else i think about my best friend could say that, i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they can describe me as a human person or i mean an animal person apologize to me, also know about you quite simply you know flexible with plans, mm, i'd say one of the most proud in my life.., hmm <tisk>, well <sigh> i am pretty happy with the level of education i've got, i also go back anyway beginning in autumn i start a p h d program so i am happy that i am happy that i know about you, break some of my bad habits from the past i would say if i'm proud of everything, it's that, i'm often very happy that i don't know if pride is the right word, but.., my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh, i'd say maybe the fact that, it's much different from my life is much different than it was about ten years ago, you know, the change i'm happy and proud that, no problem have a good day thank you, goodbye.",0

they're like the movie in the crash where people are just sitting in their cars all the time., it feels like this, no, not too much, development of children, well, i have a son and, i wanted to know how to make a good mother and so i wanted to know, about the stages he would go through, eh and be able to relate better to him, mhm, i'm, i'm trying to start it again in the fall., i'd like to write, all right., i wrote some children's books., and, i've just been researching., to get published in my books, it's just like two i've written so far, but, they are, pretty good, i got some good feedback from my review groups, <laughter> it's about, a little boy surrounded by people who are idiots and he tries to, not to become a fool with them, and <laughter> it puts him in like a really, , he walks through many moods in dealing with the people in his life, mhm, yes, i had a few problems with nervous breakdowns and at the moment my son lives with his father, so <laughter>, no, i'm a single mother, it was the hardest thing., i think in the world <laughter> is a single mother <laughter>, so, how can i handle this?, to <sigh>, good now., um, i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so, that was the problem, it's so spontaneous, like the stuff that comes out of the children's mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and, only brings a smile to your face, um, good, when my son was younger, once we sat just around the house and, he comes and he starts to do my hair and he says to me, mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails, so you can go out and get married and find a friend <laughter> so, yes, it's quite spontaneous things like that happen, that my child tells me that i don't have to be single anymore, the most difficult <sigh>, i don't want to mess it up, i feel a lot of stress and pressure, the, every little thing will make a difference and make matter, in what kind of person my child turns out, and, so, there's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., definitely, um, hmm, i think, i'm different from my mother., because i'm a little more tolerant for this spontaneous interaction, i appreciate that you know i'm welcome., i'm getting to know who my child is now., and, don't try to mold them into someone i want them to, but just, see how they will be the best, child that they are the best adult that they can be without, to shape them necessarily in this direction, to another person <laughter>, so, say it again., who is someone who has a positive influence?, to <sigh>, mm, i don't have anyone., it's like the, all right., all right., i tried to meditate sometimes, but i don't really hold on to it, often enough, um, i tried., to go for walks, but i don't always do that, and i don't always stick with it, so, yes, it is., i'd say , i'm, slightly less than average importance, that i'm getting angry, more than most people i think, hmm, last night, <laughter> but it was on the phone i was arguing with my husband, we have my sister who lives with us., and she lives with us in a very small room with, a small apartment i should say, and she's got four people living in a room, so.., it's kind of stressful it's really crowded, and my husband is stressed about it, and, you know, i'm just saying to him that, i told you when my sister moved in., then there was a mess in the house and she'll ask for things you don't really want to do, so my sister <laughter> so the house is chaotic and it is crowded, and every day they ask for journeys and my husband, he's.., avoid coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore, and i'm just saying that, he'll have to find a way to deal with it because, he asked for him, in my opinion, for <laughter> so <laughter>, hmm, it does <laughter>, oh, i've got tons of them, but right now., what comes to my mind is to lose custody of my son., um, now like, i had a fight with my stepmother., and, my step sister for a long time over, my son and how they treat him and how i want to treat him, as if they had no limits, and i think borders are important to find out who the adult is who the child is, they had my child command her around and all., in any case, because of this, you will testify in custody against me that, yeah, they'll say i'm not a good mother., because i believe in borders and we have very different, ideas about raising children, she's my stepmother, she's my father's fifth wife., and, she's, it's not really far from, how i grew up and i want to raise my child, similar to how i grew up where you are, we had some independence and we had some limitations and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us., and, with my stepmom she no rules she has no expectation she just wants to run wild, and have everything he wants, and that's okay if you're a grandparents, but the problem is that i live with them sometimes, and when i'm in the same house with them, they should follow my rules., and not, try to go and break all my rules, yeah, that's good., at this moment <sigh>, only really frustrated because they don't listen to me, i feel, disrespectful i feel, how invisible, i feel, only angry, the, they take away my right to parenthood and it's something i really worked hard to do, i went to school and studied child development, i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>, i know what i'm talking about, i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting skills., and, to have these people who have not done the same thing and have worked as hard as i must be a good parent, try to tell me i'm a bad parent, it's really, uh, hard to believe, so i feel very disrespectful, um, unrecognized angry frustrated, all these things <laughter>, um, i'll take benadryl to help me sleep, and i'm, so, my doctor gave me that she gave me benadryl, that i could take it to help me sleep., and last night i cried, before i went to sleep, so sometimes these thoughts begin to run through the head at night when you are in bed, but i tried to push her out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep easier, yeah, i always think about my son., as i wish he were with me, and how unfair all that happens is, and as i don't deserve it, to take my son away from me because i'm a really good mother, you know, and i'm too hard for myself, so, but i'm a good mother and i feel confident that i'm a good mother, i just.., i don't really have the money to take care of my son, like my son's father, who has more money than i do., and right now i'm trying to agree to it because, i know he can do more for him., financially than i could, but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mother., hmm, i'm pretty depressed i'm on antidepressants, um, i'll take wellbutrin., i've been with you for a few weeks., i think they're working, i don't know., i'm not like, i'm here today and i'm dressed. i've done it and i'm here today., not so bad, um, uh, um, uh.., my husband complains a lot he says, i'm not the same person, that i was when he married me, he said i was funny and i was positive and, i was all those other optimistic things that another thing he told me on the phone last night and < sniffle>, and, i'm not those things anymore, what's true, i mean, we got married a year ago., and then my son was taken shortly afterwards and it was just like, a shock, and, i was just trying to get back from it., but it was hard., i thought i had a problem before i found out, found out what, oh, um, yeah like crying a lot like i'm crying all the time <sbbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying, but, how to, my family would invite me, on family events, and i'd go and just cry because my son wasn't there., or by, i don't know., it's just the whole crying i think, and as i said, my husband, lets me know that i'm not the same person, so, he's disappointed., and i feel bad, even that i'm not the same person he knew, i also feel bad about it., another thing i feel bad about, you know, yeah, i'm trying., i feel like therapy is useful, um, yeah, it's nice to talk about your problems that i go in there and cry every week., so at least i have a fixed time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter>, um, that's what i mean, it's a liberation, able to cry sometimes i feel better after, um, yeah, that's good., and she helps me make decisions you know, help me to be more proactive in my life, um, all right., i'm looking for, jobs and such things and they give me ideas why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about it, you know, and then she said something about, why don't you go back to school and, so i went and applied to go back to school, you know i don't, much with my life and, sitting around all day doesn't help my depression either, so i'm trying to find a job and i applied for college, in autumn i was accepted to dominguez hill, so i can go back to school in the fall, now i'm still looking for work, but she's helping me with something like that just to give me ideas., that life is not over <laughter> that there are more that you know i could do, live with life yeah, everything is always, bittersweet, um, i don't know., the last time i was really happy, i don't know <laughter>, my ideal weekend, oh, i don't have much money because i'm not working right now, so my weekends are really just spent, maybe read, but i can't really, i, i can't pay much attention when i read, so <laughter> i have a short attention span that i can only read a few chapters <depth breath> around, but lately i've been saying that this is what i've done is reading, something i've read, , all right., i like to go to u s c, they have these nights, where, they have things like book signings or poetry and art called visions and voices., so i like to go to their events <t>, and i usually enjoy this, um, about two weeks ago, around deborah harkness there was a book caption for, a discovery of witches, and as i said, i'm trying to be a writer, so i'm trying to go to the book captions above all, and see what it's like to be an author who, conversation with a lot and signing books <laughter>, my son, i don't have any friends., my best qualities, um, i'm smart., i look good., um, i'm really.., and like a hard worker, i'm dedicated to self improvement, um, that's all i can think about right now <laughter>, all right., all right., goodbye., press the summer now",13
373,"yes, uh does it okay makes it okay, um, northern karolina, yep, almost four years ago, um i graduated from college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started this with a group of friends and then got work afterwards and enjoyed the city so much and work here since, yep, uh probably three < th>, mostly three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe a random trip there, mhm, um, it's.., i just started to get home, in the sense of that respect, where, like going home, now goes home, like going back to my family and, to see some friends, but i feel more, i feel more than i belong in loose angels than i am back home, the food goes around the weather without saying uh, i like the resources there i like to feel., i like that the things i want to do are much more accessible out here than they would be., in north carolina, so i feel like i'm uh., i'm capable of tracking., eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina, i mean, the cost of living isn't great, but at the same time, i always say that people like part of the rent have access to so much., resources <resour> so many resources out here, so it's not even expensive like new york or boston, it's not the worst, but.., uh and also i mean, it's a little annoying that every time i want to go home, it's a flight not a ride that i can't mean, imaginable < con> really conceivable, go home for the holiday because it's a three or four day adventure and just not practical, so it's uh unhappy that i'm so far away in this regard, but, i can't change geography., uh, <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media science and production, uh yes i work as a freelance author and producer, in college i realized that i was pretty good at it and i knew there was a way to monetize that and i got out of here and worked a little uh in the, uh public sector in the attempt, you know, just do these jobs this way and i realized i could, making more money have more control over my schedule and my life when i did it freelance, so i have to do it now for a little more than a year now, i love traveling i try to uh, go somewhere new for a good time, about all uh seven to eight months just trying to mix things up, so i was in barcelona only recently, and i plan, either vietnam or even back to europe in the next few months so, mhm, i enjoy the break from the routine, i think while it's nice to wake up and somehow have a vague idea where your day is going, after a few months you can get a lot into that and you, uh pigeonhole i appreciate your thought process your expectations for the day and i love to wake up in a foreign country and just, knowing that everything i do that day will be brand new and different from what i would do if i was in los angeles or, and around our own routine, so i'm a big fan of it and i love the food, so it's great,, just eat a lot of food i love in the places where they were originally created, yeah, sure i went to uh., barcelona as i said a few months ago and that was mostly because i had a girlfriend who lived there for six or seven months and she asked me to come out again and again, and uh i finally i was at a point in work where i had worked so much for months at the end that i felt like i had earned a break, so i went there for two weeks, and yes, it was one of the healthiest wisest things i've done in a while, so i, mm reminded me once again how important it is for me to at least travel and get out of the world, i'm very extraordinary, i love talking and talking to people., even virtual people, oop, i lost you., to relax me, listen and play music much i like to read uh i like to, go watch movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy, cooking around uh my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance around so i haven't seen her for weeks and that can be very uh, sadly obvious, so i'll talk to her as much as i can, but yeah, just uh, um uh pretty simple tastes, yep, this is embarrassing is not, to me i don't really have a lot of temperament so uh very good i guess i'm not getting really easily or quickly angry and uh, when i do it, i'm usually aware enough that i can, somehow formulate how i feel and why i feel so and what, i want to do it, so it's nice., i guess i'm a pretty loose guy in this respect, to be honest, it was probably a small thing, like, uh wrongly remembers when uh, something was done or like a date on something or like a fact was probably nothing emotionally heated, and it was just about yes, i think it was probably about like, try to figure out exactly when we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as the other person, thinking the other person wrong remember so to know in you small or big situation it is very difficult for me to feel really angry, uh i think in the classical sense of the word, to <sigh>, i'm trying to think that i'm not one who regrets it., i just did a project., like a movie and uh the subject had a little to do with like an ex girlfriend of mine so when it came time to publish it, i pointed out that i didn't want to send it directly to her because i didn't want her to think it was me., does to her face, but i sent it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see things and i want to, uh maybe that <tha> she could have misunderstood that as passive aggressive, i don't know about, but yes, i mean, that's something i've been thinking about, but i don't regret it as much as maybe i could have just left it., uh everyone else i wasn't sure if i should trip, unlike me it to them so, only my thoughts there, the hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh>, uh, it was actually probably uh likely that uh, ah i wasn't even making a hard decision with as i said with that same ex girlfriend i mentioned that it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh, break up with her after something happened and, it was difficult because i took great care of them, but it wasn't difficult to come to the conclusion that i was, um, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, enough with her, but at the same time it wasn't uh, the easiest thing that somehow goes through this process to get on a roller coaster that you are very aware of how mm will be terrible or frightening it, but you know you have to hit the roller coaster so uh so yeah, i'd say that's probably from new memory, i was just.., a plethora of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the best person for me so, as i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much data to find out it was pretty clear signs and i have no regret about doing it now to, i don't know., yes i feel very strong then about it and i still felt very strong that i made the right choice now, around <sigh> it may be, it can be hard, there are <b> they will make me feel it's either when i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've started to train again, which is a great help, but i would say that when i go to bed at night, i never know how it's going to happen sometimes, sometimes i wake up in an hour after sleep and i can't sleep again or, i'm just gonna get up and get up regularly, so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks, but uh yeah, like i said, especially with my current girlfriend uh not around, like i said, she's a very, great source of comfort around like this uh around but she travels a lot for work, so it's something to have to adapt and uh, uh sleep can be some that suffers from it, but uh in the same way i'm not someone who actually feels like i don't need too much sleep i, if i can get, if i can get four to six hours, i'm in pretty good shape on that day so, um, uh little timid i guess uh little more <mo> more just around, whenever i get out of a task, there's always the question of what i am, what's next, and i don't have the next one., to project set up, so it's always that nervousness around in the past something usually comes, so you can set the precedent of it usually works, but until it does, you are getting a little, um, uh anxious and it can be depressing because it's like uh, you know that i have chosen a lifestyle that, while i have a lot of control and autonomy over my life, also weighs everything on me to do it, and you know, sometimes i'm around i'm very jealous of, the idea that people are just waking up going out into an office for eight hours and don't have to think about this work as soon as they leave the office and somehow the dynamics of a, group of people or enterprises, you wear it when it's a little hard while like me when i have a day off or when i'm a sick day to get no job done <laughter> you know i'm a small company that has an employee, how can i handle this?, you.., i suppose you mean, i guess,, uh, people i work with, how i work with the, uh maybe the better answer would be how to cope with this lifestyle and just i've gotten a lot more used to it, something that i'm still learning and finding how to, how to use uh as far as i don't just know how rewarding the work is when i do it, but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live life and, you know how i uh what is the appropriate way to budget finance, which is the, uh expectation i should have for myself in a certain year, which is realistic, which is hopeful uh and that's something i'm sure to take years and years, but i feel as long as i'm getting better, then it is the progress right, uh yeah uh definitely once and then probably me if i had gone back uh, i had gone to high school, probably it would have been the second time, but yes, i was once diagnosed with depression, so i feel it's one of those things i have to keep an eye on., all my life, you know, i feel like a pretty happy person for most of it, but around uh, they have i hate as annoying as it is, but as they say, like with people who are very creative or people who tend to do a lot of stuff with the mind it is, and i understand that it's a self esteem thing because it's so hard to feel, to get so hard <har> or so easy i should think <shou> into your own head that, that was within a year, so i probably felt, uh symptoms were there before it was somehow easy to figure out how ah you know it somehow happened again so i feel uh the symptoms again uh, and to go through these emotions and feel like i was okay in the beginning i had somehow hoped that it would be something i could work through myself, but i realized it was just stupid for me to try the fight alone, so i went and see a therapist, uh uh really bad that's when i just couldn't sleep at all as if i might get an hour's sleep one night best around i wasn't sleeping at all, had just no <sigh> uh no drive to do anything, whether it was as easy as brushing teeth or, my apartment things like to clean this and just at the same time to be aware that it's like oh that's all in my head and it's not even like a, a symptom around, uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression, no, i'm just done. i mean, since i didn't graduate or anything, but i got to a point where i was like.., um, i talked through as much as i could talk through and, i had moved on to other places in my life, it was kind of good., good work especially as i said i was working on something i was really interested in i am now with someone i am very interested in, and um, there's such a possible opportunity for me not even to worry about the symptoms and so much, now that, uh i felt like therapy wasn't necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to go with so much work so, oh, i definitely think you can have someone you can trust who isn't your boyfriend or family member who isn't, you know, have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or something like that is definitely something beneficial i can't imagine how someone could not benefit from that on a somewhat routine basis, to <sigh>, i don't know that i'm a company <f> a kind of solid creditor that all these things like the things that can somehow haunt you are also for a reason like uh, my sister died when i was about twelve years old and she was younger than me., and watching my parents see my father crying for the first time was a very, kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot on that day, so it's also hard to see that and see how my parents had to deal with the loss of a child, i don't want to forget these things because i think they're very integral to, how i cope with life and how i perceive uh, having difficulties and obstacles and the image of knowing my father on it is very human, because it is so simple, somehow, you idolize your parents, and i still adore my father, but to know that he's a guy like me, and when i get older, it's easier to deal with, the man he is, so i'd be 16 or 6, um, i like the idea that they always say you wouldn't worry about what people thought about you when you realize how much people didn't think about you, and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old, and i don't know what it means to tell a six year old., but yes, i feel special when you're in high school until it's time for me to think you're living in los angeles today., so much is trapped in how people think about you and i'm still very much when i find someone anyway is either upset about me or don't like it bothers me to a large extent or i hate to let people down so, i would like to come to a healthier place where only know that sometimes you just can't really control, as people think about you, even if you have the best intentions in the world so, i'm a very compassionate guy, i'm here for my friends, i'm pretty selfless in this respect., to have a good humor about things like having <laughter> even with depression or depression i can joke about it's not you know i'm not morbid, depresses more only that i'm aware when i'm uh, i'm low and uh i treat it as such and, i don't know, i'm not trying to deny it, i'm not trying to like any of it, but i.., i've got a i'm a i'm a pretty, like practical person in this respect i don't think uh even though i'm depressed, i don't take it from people or i don't think people have told me that they don't even seem when i, mention that <cough> has gone through like depression no one seems to like or don't mention it, i feel like if i go through it it's as oh everyone can just say and, i'm just a smoking gun., sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i tend to wear it pretty well and uh, i don't lose eyes of uh, reality <rea> the reality of what i know happens so, mm, i was on a.., my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two, but she cancelled this trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and around, yes i know i <laughter> i love her she's great around her is the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh, so we got them for ten days and we just had how normal we get rarely normal couples time, as it always is, how oh i see you for five days and, then one of us has to go somewhere to be normal for ten days, where we can just cook at home., lying in bed reading books or something was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have, someone i can do this with and it feels so practical and feels so right, um, i guess for i'm a good guy like i know i know i don't know uh, i don't think i'm kidding people, i'm not a good friend to have, i'm there for people i'm looking for people i care about., uh about people and what they think about me and that's especially true for my friends and, i'm trying to make sure you know with a lot of my friends on the east coast i'm trying to carve time to make sure they know that i'm thinking about them and i'm calling them, and so i feel like uh for many people who am me as their friend, probably one of their better in the sense that i know how much i appreciate and respect the friendships we have., thank you, ellie., see you.",9
374,"yes, pretty good, alexandria virginia, mhm, i moved to i a., end of two thousand one, yes, it's crazy <laughter>, um, a few times a year usually like for holidays, it's very different., i think it's much softer, um, it's much more like suburban., it's nice., there's something comforting about it, but it's always like i'm getting a little restless when i'm there and looking forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>, i went to college in u s c., it wasn't bad, i mean my program that i was in., was so intense that, as for the first year, it was all consumed so that i really didn't have much free time to think about the adjustment, it was just like i was <laughter> my life wasn't my own so, that did it somehow, to easier i appreciate and also i was like in a community of people i knew with so automatically i knew people and you know friends and so, it wasn't bad., film, one day i had a revelation, i was no longer undergraded., i was kind of a little flundering i didn't really know what i wanted to do, and, just one day i was kind of like you know what i'm really excited about what i'm really passionate about, and, i realized that movies are the thing i love the most and i'm most passionate about it, so i decided to go to film school., a little yes and no it's not me i'm so <s> i'm like in a little transition at the moment, but yeah as in recent years i've produced uh like freelance producer <sniffle>, so this is the question of the moment <laughter> around, i think that uh, i don't necessarily have a job title that's my dream job, but i know it's kind of, what's that?, i want and because basically as i live a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know this is how exhausting and i don't want to do that anymore, so i'm looking for something that's stable, you know, full time, nice benefits and i definitely want to stay in the entertainment industry, um, and i like to know what i love about producing is that it's just like there are constant challenges and you don't know anything about it., what will be thrown at you that i, that you know that it is always interesting and exciting, so i'm trying to figure out what a good one would be right now., to be a place for me where i can reasonably be challenged and you know have a kind of, as space to grow and advance and all this, yeah, that's good., i can't see your shoes., i like to travel around, i don't know that i haven't done much lately, but i've known you in the past,, a fair amount paid, um, i love the adventure of only you know new experiences new places new people, i think it's just good to get out of your little island world and see what's out there, and you just know it., see, beautifully remarkable, places and things and simply experience different ways of life and different languages and cultures <sniffle>, um, let's see, i went to costarica a few years ago., um, my best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days and it was likely that, this could be like my, favorite trip of all time <laughter> as if it was really awesome, but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful, um, and we just spent like, we went to three different places and to explore just a lot and how sightseeing we walked a ton, which was amazing, and then like the last place we landed was this little beach town, so it was at this point as if we felt like you know that we had done all this like amazing physical effort, like ziplines and all these walks, so that when we came to the beach, it was like, we deserve the right to step back and relax., it hit everyone from the, you know it as fed this kind of desire for adventure and activity around but it also, i'm also a great fan of vacation where you just like veg out and relax and how to lie on a beach with a book so it somehow hit everything, what do i do to relax?, i mean, depending on where i am, like when it is, you know if i'm like at work or something, and i'm stressed out, i'm just gonna.., you know, take a minute and breathe just like really deep and try to calm me down, um, when i'm home, i might like it., you know, throw on a movie or like a t v show that i really like and only that gives a feeling of how, type of escape relief, pretty good, i don't mean, it takes a lot to make me very angry, it doesn't happen very often., um, the last time i had a fight with someone, my mother was <laughter> and it was about money <laughter> <depth breath>, um, i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was, how to judge me unjustly, and that was disturbing, yes <laughter>, um, it's good, uh you know they live all over the country from me so i don't see them often, but as i usually talk to, my mom on the phone probably like once in the week and, my parents are really supportive <sigh> around, they are, you know how when i go home to see how i enjoy i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time, so i'd say we have a pretty, pretty good relationship, i guess because i'm like that., type of work hunting, phase i feel guilty sometimes that i don't like, do enough you know how there are times when there are like days where maybe like i should have, sent a few more summaries or more things as i feel guilty sometimes for not how productive enough <sniffle>, usually it's pretty easy the last few weeks as was atypical as not as good, i'm not sure i haven't figured it out yet., but i just had more, uh, like nights, in which, either, takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason, um, i also have a lot like really strange intense dreams that wake up like me sometimes i wake up myself sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking, which is weird <laughter> the so yes, it's just i don't know, not that i was able to identify, i mean, i think maybe i'm more stressed than usual just because i'm doing my job situation like, in the river, but, i don't know that there was no similar event., i appreciate good sleep, and i'm used to it, so it's just not good., feeling, um, not really no, yes, to <sigh>, as < sigh>, i think in how, october or november, although this is actually the second time that it happened in my life, but the first time was like, many years ago <sniffle>, um, i felt like i was, a really low and how too low for me to free me from, to <sigh>, just a hard time, work on the most fundamental, level as only, get up and, in a shower, and go to the grocery store, and you know, answering e mails was just like, it took so much energy, um, so yeah, i just wasn't really, normal working, yeah, that's good., yes, yeah., <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say, so, < deep breath> i think that the therapy, is good for me because it, helps me to open up, my kind of patterns.., and also like, ah, just how to observe how i am like reaction to certain situations and just think it's < deep breath> it gives me a more elevated like kind of self consciousness around, so that unlike just like, um, kind of just react to situations i'm like, mm, just as if i noticed more what's going on around, and it just helps,, um, i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really know <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>, , i don't know., i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale>, oh, maybe about uh, about christmas at home with my family, yeah, that's good., um, well, it was just, it was like i just started getting out of my depression., and, as you know, i live alone here i have a dog, but so i only had a long time of, feeling, not, <laughter> great and easy to do everything alone and somehow wish my family was around me, um, so, when i was with them, it was just.., it just felt very much like, safe and comfortable and just as you know it, warm family hug, to <sigh>, <laughter> i think she'd call me, funny, and smart, and, um, a good listener, not legally binding, um, i don't know that <laughter> enough <laughter>, all right., so, this happened, the last like, job i had i mean i was it wasn't technical i was a freelancer, but i worked for this company for how, one and a half years almost two years and uh, i had a very small company, the boss had a really good relationship with my boss, and he's kind of pissed off., he's kind of out of nowhere, uh, mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and around, essentially as, the agreement we had is that he would pay me like a monthly holder for my services and then i would get paid fees per project, so he liked to put me on this conversation and was like you know our big customer who's like you know the bread and butter of the company that they really cut back, as you probably notice that things are getting really slow and i was like yeah, and he's like i'm gonna stop paying you for your hold., and that was a total surprise, but i was fine and he went on to talk like, he, i would still have the right to the first rejection of all the projects that came through the door and you know because that he seemed like you know, even if i didn't get the retainer anymore, he would still throw me enough work, as if i didn't know it wasn't like a drama., decline in the amount of money i made <cough> excuse me, but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work that i love to work with you, you're fantastic, yada yada so, to make a long story short, what happened then, that he fired me., um, and he was his way of pushing me out of the company and letting me go because from then on,, he stopped calling me, he stopped e mailing me., and later like a few months down the street, i had to go back to the office because there were some projects that still, running like the customer took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was there, i saw that around, this guy who, had worked with us a number of similar, if we needed another producer, like if we were beaten, we would get him to do something else., he did my job like that., yeah, so it's just like, it was a real <rea> <laughter> it was a really crappy way of getting fired without being told that i was fired around and it was just like, that uh the reason i want if i could erase that is out of my mind because i don't really think of another situation that makes me feel as angry and frustrated and just like, in a way that, that, although this was as you know a few months ago, feels very unresolved and makes me somehow like, angry when i think about it, so yeah that was a very long explanation, but that's what i want <laughter>, , i um, a very loyal person <deep breath> around, i'm, smart i am organized i < deep breath> around, very like caring kind, um, i'm conscientious., and i work hard <sniffle>, <laughter> uh, man, i think, to uh, be more confident, and, less passive, um, to really, focus on, what i want and the things i know will make me happy and just go out and get them instead of sitting back and waiting for opportunities to imagine, hmm <sigh> um, probably just a few of the, relationships i formed with people, um, just like really, you know deep friendships, you're welcome., see you.",2
375,"yes, good, it was a nice day., the south bay, i can also ask you this question., oh, all right., that's where i'm basically, but like the south bay of, i didn't want to move much anyway., just to get a change everyone thinks l a is like, all it is the best, but, there are too many people and too much traffic, i can't see your shoes., drive and see new things, last year i went to sacramento, from here and, stayed for like a month living in my v w bus with my wife it was somehow a cool camping, just wanted to have fun something else, article no, not at all., probably do what you do, i'm really interested in finding new ideas and things., outward, i haven't done much lately to relax, but i like the beach, good, i argued with my brother about him last night., speak to me with more respect, as a person, i was crazy and i wanted to fight, it's good, but sometimes they're just, they are too entangled in what they do to pay attention to other people's feelings., like with my brother he's just, he's just tense about his situation, and he tried to brush it off on me., wasting money because i'm married now, yeah, i'm not., something like probably take some candy out of the store, no no, taking money from my mother when i was really young, because they, well, i was like in junior high school and, i think i took like twenty out of her purse and bought candy for my friends and, i felt guilty even though on the same day, probably yes, that was probably the beginning of my stupid activities, my whole life or in the last few years, my wife, i'm married to her., we've known each other for two years., i met her on an art walk, she also went to u s c, the last few days have been, kind of hard, but i usually go to sleep well, i think i'm kind of snappy < sn> i think i'm snappy, positively optimistic, yeah, that's good., i've been thinking more positive lately., and i want to put a lot of things into action, so i tried to train my mind in, i know that stuff's coming to me., in conversation with the universe, simple if you just try and do it, everyone has a ghost, no, i just told you i felt positive., i was happy yesterday <yester> i was happy yesterday because i know that i made some good decisions, want to be positive and stay away from negative people, being alive, know god, i don't know., i don't know i can't think of anything right now., i don't think i can have one., gender, exercise, wake up positive and a good meal in the morning, i think i'm going to sacramento., no, don't smoke cigarettes and see how you spend your money, you will sell my ideas and my uh <laughter>, thoughts, i can't think of that right now.",5
376,"yes, i'm fine, it's still tomorrow, so.., i'm from the east coast of massachusetts, yes, i moved to l a when i was a child with my parents, pretty much had no choice in the matter <laughter>, i wasn't there the last time i was there, three years ago for christmas., um, it's very hectic, there are a lot of people who are angry., and many people are not interested in the other person here in l a, in which in the east of the east coast the thought pattern is much different you know your neighbors you are friendly to your neighbors and to everyone you see on the road, , yeah, that's good., well, since i was a kid, i was pretty young at first it was hard i was in trouble a little at school, but.., after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did well in high shcool and so and even took some college courses, um, well, i love the beach, and i love the mountains i like to walk, um and i like walking along the beach i live only a few blocks away from the beach, so it's easy, no, not at all, just not interested uh i was on mexico a few times when i was younger, went to ensenada, but except that i'm not interested in leaving the united states, especially with what has happened lately, to go abroad, around <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the care program for a little, but i had some problems at home, which caused me to get out, oh, that's all right., a the value of the goods in question shall be equal to or less than the value of the goods in question , um, i don't have any., to be honest around, i admire people who do the job they love, i mean like football players who like to play football, and they get all the money paid, how big is that <laughter>, so, i'm pretty intrusive when i meet someone first., to say, if we want to, continue to communicate with the person or not, and once i have decided that i like this person or whatever i talk a lot, so, yes, um, i like watching movies, i like reading, but lately my concentration wasn't that big, so it's hard to get into a good book, not good in times i uh i have a, some breakout every time in a while so anyway it depends on how angry i get, yesterday, and it was with my partner, and, to be honest, i don't know what it was anymore, it's just, sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate it and when i feel that i'm disrespectful or whatever i'm going to stand up for myself, so, um, sometimes some people can be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i am, what is in my mind, i don't know., deliberately go and hurt people's feelings or anything of this nature, but, i'm not being bullied and i'm not being made to not return when i feel like i'm being challenged, so, um, my mother died last year., so, i wish i could've done it differently., um, it stirs up <ups> it upsets me, so, it's okay., let me see., uh.., i think i'm going to pass this on, too, because it's getting me more upset, so <laughter>, that's sometimes awful uh sometimes actually falling asleep can be no problem, especially you know when you're done working and doing everything you had to do in a day, you're tired, but staying asleep is a completely different thing for me, because, it's like i can't uh, i get up and then i'm awake i'm going to the living room turn the t v and watch t v i'm lucky when i sleep three to four hours, maybe because i have a lot in my mind., uh you know, think about bills and, and, the stressiness of the work and then all the other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it, it's not hard, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes to overtime mode, it just affects everything your concentration your sleep your food, everything like this, i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning man <laughter>, i like the nights, but i don't like the morning, it's like leaving me alone until i get my first cup of coffee, yeah, that's good., so different from the, i'm, i'm fine., well, i was depressed., for some time, and i still have difficulties <diff> difficulty, because after my mother's death four months later my uncle died, so i've had two deaths last year, so i'm still wavering and trying to, to get back together, i'm just recently i've started to pursue like interests that i used to do, that i haven't done in a year because of what happened, um, i'm just.., i could get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat too much i eat too much, um, i get tired very easily because i don't get much sleep, so sometimes it's hard, it seems like i'm fighting to get through the day, yes, i have a psychiatrist who prescribes me medication on a regular basis., oh i was diagnosed some time ago hm probably, ten to fifteen years ago, and it's just something i never have, i don't know if or not, you can, so i've always taken the medicine., um, i was, fight with each of my family my friends and so and me, was desperate and hopeless, and i had tried to take my own life years ago, what took me to the hospital, and then uh, they started treating me, i started seeing a therapist, so, well, right now, i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance covers the psychiatrist and not the therapist., but i work with a friend of mine who <ha>, ways to go to seek help for a therapist and i don't know if this will really help me, i mean at some point it depends on what kind of therapist you sometimes just sit people there, and they just listen to you when you talk and go on and you think, my god, what's good is that?, and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback, how to deal with emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions, so, um, as i said, i didn't go to therapy recently just psychiatrists just medications, um, there were no real changes., i would probably do well because i did well before my mother died, i was her nurse, and uh, even if many times i, i felt overwhelmed or, missing <l> uh missing patience with her, uh, i was still much happier., when i am now, so, um, uh.., i'd say when my son was born years ago, i'm not a parent anymore, he died., so, um, and that was also difficult, uh, hmm, around i am extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me, because i get everything done that i should be done, although sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained, and, you know, these qualities are admirable in people who can keep their word and be responsible, excuse me., oh, i have a lot of regret for, things i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about, but you know i met someone once in my life., that had this saying and you see it on a bumper sticker, uh, live to never regret, so you know you can't go back and make changes, it's too late, so why you know you have the situation., but sometimes it's a lot easier said than done, to i'm not the advice somehow getting person <laughter> i know i don't really know, give my friends every advice i can, i find most of the times people don't listen to you, so why bother, um, i'm just saying my opinion, that's all., i'm on a diet because i ate too much., after my mother died, i was much thinner than she was alive., i just went crazy with the food and a lot of sleeping, you know that sleep eat sleep eat, and now i'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight, because it's very unhealthy for me, um, hmm, i'm trying to believe it's been a long time., actually, there's nothing, because, now i just keep my thoughts busy, i haven't been in a movie in ages, i haven't gone shopping all the time., um, so it's been a long time since it's been so long., i was content and happy with who i am and what i do in my life., around my weekends saturday <sa> uh like saturday i usually work, around sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house, um, running some errands going shopping for food, you know that., so, it's not that if i was younger, you know, it would be fun to do clubbing or whatever, but i'm too old for it now., , um, there's nothing i can imagine., there's nothing i can be proud of, hmm, um, some a good like comedy or whatever i like to see that around, sometimes my partner could do something stupid i like, 'cause i like to make fun of him, um, but mm only that's what you know, go maybe go for a walk on the beach, that's it, all right., no problem, thank you., see you.",12
377,"yeah, come on., i'm fine., i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a little and then i lived abroad for a little while then i moved to california, mhm, i moved here at the end of june last year, so i guess it was eight months ago that there was such a thing., to <sigh>, most likely twice a year, to <sigh> it's a good question, i've always wanted to live in california, but i had lived in the central coast around, and, i had just come to l a as once a month for various business and network and personal development things so, yeah, things changed., in santa cruz for me the customer i had who was really the most important as financial, um, main source of finance i had that relationship ended, so i was totally free to move and i thought, well i think i'll give l a a try and see what happens so, so i gave it a chance and here i am, oh not at all <laughter> it's a very big city around, i lived in dublin in ireland it was one that is also a big city, but, as you know, european cities are much more dense and public transport is much easier to use., and, yeah, so just getting around here and getting acquainted with the city was pretty challenging and uh, yeah, that's good., so, i love to travel i love it yes i have lived in ireland and i traveled around, i was in morocco and i was in costa rica, i spent some time in mexico, so.., yeah, that's good., to meet i love <sigh> new people who experience new cultures and how, not only see what is different, but see what is similar among people everywhere you go, to be sure, good., i guess.., i'm trying to think what my favorite was i mean anyway there were amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but, morocco was incredible, it was like twelve days and we went to three different places that we found in the atlas mountains that are beautiful and uh, yeah, it's a really cool culture, so it was fun., um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there, which is why i decided to move there, so, my most memorable moment of this trip, i mean, there are probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of this trip was, to be on a bus and go, to dublin and go only to the country and, see how absolutely stunningly beautiful it is i mean, it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in movies and it's green and lush and beautiful, but, when you actually get there and experience it, it's like the pictures don't do it right, so it was incredible, yeah, that's good., um i have a degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women's studies, no i use my english and psychology to work in marketing communication so, i'm actually doing sales, so yes, psychology definitely comes into play., comes into play and anyway does my, i guess my undergrade in english, but really how i accepted that and created something out of it because most people who only teach an english degree and i didn't want to teach, um, to, i'm not quite sure about the question., all right., wow around <sigh>, you know my dream job is, as a, a motivational speaker and trainer and trainer, to travel the world, to do so and to influence people's lives, and, to make a real contribution to people, around my relationship is pretty good actually i, i just fixed my relationship with my biological mother who, she wasn't sporadic i saw her grow up sporadic i lived my father pulled me and then he married my stepmother and, they had two children together, so i grew up and i consider them the family i grew up with, but i talked to my biological mother., um, last may and we were, we know that things have been cleared up and have been in communication ever since., um, well, i don't know what moment you mean, but if you mean to be in communication with my biological mother, um, i mean, it was very liberating to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and anyway not only the future, but in the present moment with it so, yeah, that's good., i'm shy., to relax, i do a number of things that i like to do yoga, although i don't have the money for it right now. i love to dance., i love to read, i love to go into the ocean spending time just staring at the waves and soaking all these negative ions, which really recharges my battery, probably more than anything else, um, i like being with friends around, i love art and, try new restaurants around, yeah, all these things are, both relaxing anyway i think they relax in the sense that, i feel connected with the people in my life and with the experiences of my life so, yeah, that's right., depends on whether i'm not driving very well, but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>, to <sigh> last time i argued with someone, it should probably be, oh no, it was with the l a times about newspaper delivery, yeah, that was the last time., yes, the <sigh>um the newspaper that should appear for the elderly lady i care for, it didn't show up., and, i didn't know it was just there., um, late, i don't know, afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called her and, they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning, which was absurd to me when they made the mistake at all., so i mean for a service we pay for every day, so, um, it was really irritable and then i found out that, the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and had not been communicated with me, so, i was angry at the times when i was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and had not told me that i was quite frustrated., oh wow there are quite a lot of them around, let me think about one, um, i had a call the other day., and i'm in a coaching program and, it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program, and she explained to me that there was an additional call that we would meet every week, and then we also have coaching calls because we have a specific trainer we work with., and then she called to tell me that i had another coaching call with, um, someone who's not my coach and uh that, had not been explained to me as part of the program so that at that moment it seemed to me just like oh my god i have all this, people i have to be accountable to and i'm like anyway you know i have to, not only be accountable to them, but share private things that happen in my life with these people and it was just i don't know, so, yeah, i wasn't.., i wasn't angry i was just feeling frustrated and a little overwhelmed at this moment and, you know, and i talked her out of it, and we've been through it, but.., um, yeah, i could have done it., sure was just okay with what was asked by me at that time and, i would have made the call much smoother., the hardest decision there was was a few., i guess moving to ireland was probably the toughest decision, no, it wasn't even the hardest decision, it was such a simple decision, but telling my family about it was, challenging, but the hardest decision was my first time that i, moved, uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided i decided to move to colorado, and that was a pretty tough decision, because then my family was, you know, within an hour drive from wherever i lived for an hour and a half and now you'll know,, around a twelve hour drive or an airplane ride away, so it was difficult, oh, many things.., i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful and beautiful condition, the weather is so much better than wisconsin and around, at the time i was very much in rock climbing, and there is only a huge outdoor community in colorado, so there were a lot more people who, to be in my age group and or single that was another factor around, and were interested in the things i was interested in, so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit, so, yes and then i found a job i liked the pay was cruel, but, i found some work that was really rewarding and so everything came together and i decided to move, yeah, that's good., that was a completely independent question about <sigh>, relatively light, it just depends on how long i go to sleep when i'm outside and i don't come home until eleven thirty, you know, then i go to bed too late and uh i wake up on feeling tired as i feel today, but usually i can sleep through the night i had some pretty, fear paralyzed dreams over the last few weeks, but even if i wake up from them or if i know i can move from them, i can still fall back relatively easily to sleep, yeah, i'm sure they're i mean, i'm in another transition state from which i'm moving out, from the house where i live, where i take care of an elderly woman., yeah, and i just need to find, the financial means to support me and it is, and she creates a lot of fear just in her state of being she is exhausting and totally depressing, so, yeah, that's good., to live with her is pretty hard, as if it was probably the most difficult thing i've ever done, and i would never do it again if i were honest, if i knew what i was getting into, i don't think i would have said yes to the situation., i feel trapped and helpless, like you don't know anything i can do., there's no way out of the situation that i don't care what i do, it doesn't get better i don't know that i don't get any kind of work i want to do, and my money doesn't work at all., so yeah, it feels pretty crappy, <laughter>thank you, i've been in the past, yes, oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago, i was suicidal., oh, yeah, i feel like i'm down there, i don't really know no, um, i stopped originally., with my therapist because we had finished, i mean, we had, worked on what had to be worked and i was no longer depressed, and then i started the therapy again, later, i think i was in my early thirties., and then we ended this because i moved to ireland, so.., yes, i mean, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention as i don't think in therapy oh i'll be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous, i think you're going to therapy to work on a particular problem and have a solution and someone who's your soundboard can see things you can't see., and, you know, work through this situation and come with.., a strategy for, not only that not only the creation of a solution in this area, but also the creation of strategies, and uh tools for the rest of your life so you don't have to be in therapy forever, deep breath the last time i felt really happy, what are you doing?, wow, that's pretty sad, it's been at least a year., no, that's not true., if i, saw my biological mother who was last may, my best qualities, to <sigh>, i'm very strong, very strong willed, i um, i am very supportive and loving and caring, um, i'm just being here, i'm intelligent., and, um, yeah, that's good., everything i regret, i don't think so., no, don't take life too seriously, oh, my ideal weekend, i spend some time on the beach, i spend some time with friends, either go out in the evening in a movie, or, i'm just going out to.., a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together, to maybe go dancing later, and on sundays i usually go to, , and then i got brunch with friends and, um, yeah, i'm going home and sunday night i'm getting ready for the next day so, hmm <sigh>, i'm very proud of, um, a few things i mean, i moved to places i wanted to move to., and so i have done things that have really spoken to me and have, meaning something you know that i loved the heart to actually do it., um, mm reach those who , objectives or objectives, yes, i did things i wanted to do, like move to ireland and move to california., mhm, all right., safe, see you.",16
378,"yes, pretty good, i grew up in boston, about thirty years ago, yep, not too often, maybe once a year sometimes less, oh, i love living in l a, i never want to live anywhere else, well, i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and, the weather was good and, that's part of it., very simple, good maybe something easy the beginning of the first few weeks was really hard, just being in a new environment and being away from everyone i knew, but after a few weeks it was great, radio journalism, well, it's something i've wanted to do since i was 12., and all i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was somehow in pursuit of this dream, no <laughter>, well, it's kind of a long story, but i was fired from my first job when i was, in my twenties, and, it's just, once i had done this work, i realized that this is not really what i wanted to do, it was also, it just wasn't suitable for me, it didn't make me happy., yep < sigh>, my dream job works with football players and helps them to recover from concussion and other injuries, <deep breath> good the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is to find the right people and work the connections with them, it, i'm not so much on the road anymore., i love to see different places and different things like i love to go to places that don't like, where i come from, my favorite trip is that i was in australia for my thirtieth birthday., because i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday when i crossed the international date limit., and i went to this really small place on the, uh west coast of australia called shark bay, where native dolphins live and swim, and is for the most part very isolated and i have to be there for a whole week and only really a lot of myself, with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you, and it's amazing just a beautiful place in the world, more shy <sigh>, < deep breath> why < sigh> hm that's a good question around, the first thing i think about is because i've always been like this., but maybe that's an excuse i don't know., i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than many people, so sighing , i'm looking at a lot of t v <sigh>, or that's probably not the best alternative, but it's something i do, and i also go to the beach because i live near the beach, so that's one of my favorite things to relax, , it depends on the situation, but most of the time i'm pretty good, i don't think i tend to argue with people, i think i just get angry about situations, but not in humans directly <sigh>, i don't know if i'm feeling guilty about anything right now., i don't know if i have one right now., <deep breath> sounds of other people's noise make me really angry, i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and disgusting., not considerate, about her neighbors that makes me really crazy, yeah, look at me., hmm <sigh>, well, the only one that comes to mind from the top of my head is when i bought my apartment, it felt like a really hard decision at the time, you know, i didn't know i could do it, i wasn't sure if i had the money to do it., so that felt like a really difficult decision, but in hindsight of course it proved to be a big decision, but at the time it was really difficult to do that, pretty easy i sleep pretty well <sigh>, <deep breath> mostly good i'm just really worried about money at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say i'm how big, but i'm worried, but you know i'm confident it'll work., no <sigh>, yes, hmm <sigh>, i don't know i can't remember., i mean, i don't feel, super happy all the time, but i don't feel unhappy either somehow like just uh, even, kiel, well, i have to go to the.., my friends work at the film academy so i can see all oscar nominated films, , she was there one night, so i really enjoyed catching up with her and, to see them again, so that was very pleasant <sigh>, , they would say to be reliable, and, loyal < sigh>, and, considerate and considerate, i've been working really hard on it., i think, there are many things i might do differently, but there's nothing i really regret, um, well, i think there are things., the, to <sigh>, as if it wasn't worth wasting the energy, thinking about things i regret, so i didn't regret much about things, deep breath oh, that's a good question sigh don't worry about that little stuff , and save more money <laughter>, for example , well, there are, uh, you know, normal things like i'd lose more weight and i'd like to, uh.., think a little more fearless maybe <sigh>, be a little braver, i don't think i have them., i'm self employed, so i'm working all the time <laughter> so my ideal weekend is to have a lot of customers., um, this is something i enjoy, um, so that would be ideal at this point my weekends if i were really busy, <deep breath> that i was really able to take care of myself and that, you know i did pretty much everything i said i wanted to do., i did this., and i don't and i have no regrets about things there's nothing really that, eh, is unfeeling undone, surely in my life there are many things i still want to do, um, but.., i feel like i did what i said., yeah, that's not so great, it's okay, my parents both died, and i have a sister and a brother., um, i feel closer to my brother than to my sister, but.., they both live on the east coast and i live in l a, and then i have my sister has two girls, so i feel very close to my nieces, even though we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers., they have other things in mind, <deep breath> to probably my teacher, a person from whom i have learned my holistic bodywork, i really like it, <sigh>, model my work and my way of being after him, as if he were a good example, for me the way he keeps his work and how he lives his life, we're pretty close, we don't know the best friends, but i know i can call him anytime i need him., around <sigh> put me in a good mood <sigh>, usually with my friends or go to dinner, or by < sigh>, yeah, i'm just spending time with my friends, all right., thank you <sigh>, see you.",1
379,"yes, i feel okay little tired but for the most part feels pretty good, i'm actually originally from forest hills that i was born in the san fernando valley, and then i moved to lomita, which is in loose circle, ca. mm probably by nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm now twenty three so, it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've lived there yeah, some things i really like, i'd have to say, you know,, the beach, you know., not so much traffic doesn't really care about it, but it does., in any case, you know exactly how the nightlife is., just people in general i like talking to others so yeah, right, yep, yeah, actually, i mean, i can't see your shoes, but, um, actually, i travel a lot, i was in places like hawaii., was on the caribbean, i was seeing at uh times <machte sound with mouth>, you only know different places like, arizona, i was in oregon washton., pretty everywhere i would say so but usually especially as to hawaii and the caribbean mexico so, yep <free throat>, i think it's just the experience you know as if you couldn't experience culture., to different people you only know the whole background of the landscape, it's just that you know it's something new to experience, i'd say, something you know that people haven't seen yet, so, well, let's see, i recently made a trip to hawaii a few months ago, which was back in december it was christmas time, new years so that was pretty fun we went to a few different islands, we went to uh see, i think it was kauai going to oahu, uh maui you know places like this so, yep, you know i'd have to say that, around you probably know like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know, just like i said before the whole experience factor, just look around you know new different things things that are unique so, yeah, that's good., i'm studying journalism right now, i'm in my last semester, so i'm over <bout> until graduation couple of months, yep, well, you know, it's kind of funny because you know that i started a two year community college at a.. you know., and so you know, i went into uh like business management know something to do with you, i think, < thin> basically about accounting, but i thought it wasn't for me., so i decided to go into journalism because i couldn't say that i would probably still be sitting at a desk, but, you know, at least with journalism, i can go to the field and you know, talk to people, and you know,, arta you know, get information collecting information that arta deal and then you know write stories, i just thought it was you know it was much more interesting to me, unlike you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so, yep, my dream job, i'd have to say you know something on the radio show., sport transmission, you know, i think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine., so, my relationship with my family it's pretty good you know i'm still living with my parents, as i said, i am twenty three years old, there are times when it can be a little shaky, a little stony, but.., for the most part, it's pretty good that you know i've matured a lot in recent years., things are, uh, you know, i'd say things are going pretty well., you know, i think it's coming somewhere in the middle, you know, sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and relaxed, other times i somehow it's not as much as i go into my bowl, but, you know sometimes how i can be kind of shy when i don't know people so well or when i've never met them before, so it's one of those things that somehow you have to meet me in the middle of it, because you know,, i can either talk very talkatively, or sometimes you know i can be a little shy, but you know, once i get this conversation started, i'm pretty talkative and, so, um, you usually know, um.., i would listen to music, or maybe you just know that you're kind of going on a ride, or you know you're hanging out with my friends, you just know something to know somehow., lightness that you know because you know how i said, sometimes you get a bit tense and you just want to relax and you know only the things you enjoy, so, you know i was really better with it., a few years ago, you know that i, there were points where i could pretty much not control my temperament, however, as <li> i mean, i would just, pretty angry at you know the smallest things that everything would just tick me off somehow, but, you know, i definitely learned, uh you know, control over this kind of thing, and you know it made me a better person because it burns my throat., well, let's see, i'm trying to think it was probably something with my family with my mother, maybe it's i can't remember from the top of my head, but, you know, it's always something so miniscule that, that's probably why i don't remember., but you know we're gonna make up for this sometime, and i apologize because you know i accept that., you know i'm wrong under certain circumstances., yeah, that's good., something i feel guilty about, maybe you know that i'm not as nice to others as i could have been in the past, you know, and that's the past, and you know, i don't like staying in this way, but i think this is one thing that i've tried to work on, but it's also one thing that i regret somehow, not just do, just be nice, the hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty new, a little hard because i actually have a buddy who was in the luftwaffe and he recently, diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia, so that was really hard, and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not quite there the way he used to be., so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm ignoring him and i don't want to do that, but at the same time i don't know his tendencies., he could be a little bit., crazy, so, maybe you know some kind of traumatic stress disorder, maybe when he was in the military, so i don't know, but yes., yeah, it's pretty hard, you know, because we've been back a long time., were best friends with him because i was probably about five six years old, so it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to handle, but you know, i'm trying to, i don't know., try to stay in mind, but you know it's always there, i don't forget, so yeah, my best friend, well, he would probably say that you know i'm a pretty pretty guy., usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest, but you know i'm trying to work on it too, he'd probably say i'm pretty funny., i like hanging out with you., mode, doing things here and there that you only know, normal activities like any other person you know going to the beach hanging out movies that you know grab a few beers that kind of deal so yeah, <freezes the throat, you know, it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know when i'm really tired, you know, i'm probably going to have a very good sleep, i haven't slept so well in the last few days, because you know,, my house, there's workers on the roof, so use the new roof, so it's kind of tough., so that wakes me always early in the morning so sometimes a little crabby, but for the most part, i usually get a pretty good sleep <empty throat>, lately eh, you've felt pretty good because you know things are starting to look up., i actually did an internship about <bout> a month ago, for you know, my field of journalism, so that's good to graduate in two months, so i'm looking forward to,, to make a little more money, you know that's good, and yes, things are going pretty well right now, i can't complain < clears throat>, yeah, it's not bad that you know how i said it could always be worse right, but, you know, i enjoy life, so it's the best part, i have not been going on, no, yes, no, last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably back to my buddy when you know that he was still, i guess you could say we know he came back to visit the air force he had left., so you know we were just hanging out, you know i have a few beers and i'm just talking about life, so it was nice, but i miss you knowing., i felt great that you know, for there is nothing like having a best friend that can be entertained, whom you can know twenty four seven above all., can tell him everything in confidence, and he could tell me everything in confidence, how, it's hard to find that you especially know someone you've known for so many years, and then you can't really get it back now., yeah, that's good., yes, there's one, there's probably one or two things i regret, well, i mean, i regret having a d u i over, three or four years ago, actually, it was four years ago, so that's something i definitely regret because you know that i look back on it and you know that things might have been different, but at the same time, you have to accept that you know the actions you know., which has taken place, so you know, i'm manned and you know, i think i think i'm better off for it, but at the same time, you know it will always be in the back of your mind, as i said., it's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way., now you know, it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a kid then, so i really don't know what to say, even though, i would have listened, who knows, but you know that i probably would have told myself that you knew exactly., be careful, you know., make sure you can be the best person you may be, um, basically you know, just always be nice honest, to take care only of others, so, to probably get back to my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing, i'm not saying that i wish i could erase it i just wish it didn't happen like this, so, yeah, that's good., my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends, either you know we're hanging out in the day, you know that certain things like you know, maybe grab a few beers, to you know you just have casual entertainment maybe play games movies look you know only the standard stuff that people do this, some things i wish i could change, um, maybe you just know you're nicer than i said before., um, maybe not to be so lazy have more determination, i mean, i have a lot of determination, i know what i want to do with my life., but i know there are times when i'm kind of, get a little laxadaisical so i wish i could improve on that and not delay so much, well, you know, it's hard to think back, but i would probably say a time when someone is making me feel really bad you know, i'd say like if i was you know kind of angry at certain people maybe just kind of chew my friends if i probably shouldn't, i have tried to make more constructive criticisms, but, at the same time i knew it was probably not my place to say these kinds of things and, they were out of character, so, my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely working hard i'm sure, i'm very caring now, more than i used to be, very honest, and you know i love talking to people, i like to make new relationships, i like to make people laugh <empty throat>, something i did recently that i really enjoyed, you know, it was probably about my internship, i was just you know i wrote a story or two., and it just felt good that you know these stories are done and eventually they're going to go to the newspaper, so, i feel that way., you know it's one of those things when you're working on something and then you see the product right there, you know it's right in your face, and you can tell yourself that you know how i did it., so, makes me feel good yep, you know, let's just see some different stories., usually things about good the newspaper is in long beach, so it's usually about you stories or events that take place in long beach, so yeah, i'd say i'm very proud that you know the degree., gymnasium about to graduate from college, hopefully you know obviously that i'm earning a degree and then hopefully you get to know a good solid job, you know in the near future, i think this is one thing i'm most proud of, thank you.",2
380,"safe, i'm fine., yeah, that's good., i'm from maryland., yeah, that's good., by maryland washton d c area, uh like five weeks ago, maryland around <deep breath> it's a lot it's a lot less around, uh it's a uh it's not so nice at this time of year it's more about, it's fine, it's nice, it's.., it's much better, but there's a lot more people going on., i'm still getting used to it, so i guess i'm still getting used to it, so.., um, it's, it's not like.., yeah, i'm still getting used to it coming slowly, but i'm sure., i live in the culver city, i've got one., it's okay, i live in a really nasty house, it's cheap, it's cheap, because i live in a friend's apartment., um, and uh, but and he lets me stay there for half the price, but the actual place itself is quite terrible <horr> terrible living conditions <laughter> but i'm moving soon, so, i can't see your shoes., uh but no i travel i would say i i probably have more than most people in the u s like considering that most people don't travel to the u s, but i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything, i enjoy the chance to see others, to walks of life and how to meditate on the, the specificity of my own, they know that the < th> given the parameters i grew up under, how different everyone else is like, how every life is totally around, i also mean just within the u s like seeing someone grow in california is as different as someone growing in maryland and then thinking about someone growing up in like thailand or something it's nice it's pretty amazing, mhm, uh, okay., hmm, i'm right here ellie, um, let's see., uh, well, um.., it's been a while since i was on a trip, i guess, one of the last trips i made was to, i mean it was a like two years ago i went on road trip over the u s and that was that was pretty amazing, but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l a this is before i actually moved here, but to visit new orleans and new orleans was just this whole, like, although it's part of the u s it's like a total, it's completely different than anywhere else, it's so.., unique the culture there is so unique and the mixture of caribbean and french and all these other influences in as the american south is so, so, um.., unbelievable, yes, it's just unreal, yes, it's unreal, yes, it's unreal., hmm, it's a difficult question., one <on>um, i don't know., hmm, you know that i can give you back to this question you are able to, yeah, that's good., come back., yeah, that's good., that's what i just said., film, you know, that's actually a question i asked myself that i knew i knew., i've had my whole life like phases of interest, so when i was how very young i was really in the first phase that i remember were keys and then tools as i go around collecting keys, and then i would go around collecting tool like any kind of tool i had a toolbox my parents told me that i was a phase before that with which balls were like different balls, um, and then i was really in insects that collected insects and reptiles and so and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and, at a certain <cert> and anyway at a certain point i really got killed, like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then eventually in there i had told <to> i remeber someone that at the moment i'm interested in, playwriting and and poetry, but finally i wanted to be interested in uh film, how i could somehow see the trajectory coming, but i don't remember what led me to this conclusion i just always think, i've lived a protected life as far as movies are concerned, i didn't let my parents watch a r rated movie until i was almost like that in high school., um, and uh and i never, uh so i never saw a r rated movie i was also very zimperish as i remember when i was, pretty young maybe like six i saw star wars, the first scene in darth star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck, and so only a small scene very at the beginning and that like me freaked out and i had to leave the room so, i'm not sure., yes, it is., i don't know exactly how i got into the movie., but, i've always been fascinated by, how people interact and what you know about acting and so and movies in general, i'm just.., to be a filmmaker to direct, and uh put <pu> joined, and do <ma> as i think directly i don't use mm that word so much because it i think i think it's more than like i want the opportunity to put together and make, films, uh or making movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it because i want you to know i want to participate in all, all processes, but, i guess the best parable for that would be a director, director, it's much better if i don't live with them., um, my, i guess.., it's funny you ask ellie., i've been thinking a lot about it lately, i think i'm close to my whole family i'm closest with my father around i'm coming with my brother and sister you know how, but i don't, when they're gone, as my brother is in a foreign country at the moment, so i do not have the opportunity to talk to him, but how, i spend more time with my dad than anyone else because i feel like he's the most like, from all my family he is the one who accepts and likes me the most, thinks positively of me, so it's, i've got like a, a complicated relationship with my parents, i mean <mea> and my family in general, well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extroverter but lately <late> as moved since, but i'm not like, um, i'm not i would probably be on the scheme of the extroversion uh or on the scale of the extroversion sorry around i would be extremely introverted around, i just see other extroverts and no matter who they are, they're able to like strike talks and i'm a pretty shy person i'm kind of like, uh, or inhibited person perhaps to, so i like it, until, yeah, i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it, in the past, i'd smoke weed, but i stopped smoking weed., so now i know i have a glass of wine and, maybe you're watching a movie., um, i didn't or maybe leave as it will depending on whether it's like a when it comes to, if it's a worn out kind of stress, as if i were just like, then i'm what i do, but if it's a more like fear type stress, i could, go on a uh an intense walk not really practice that much, but i like, you know competitive sports and hiking, pretty good, well, i always like to fight around, i wouldn't call to fight to lose my temper., um, i enjoy a vicious debate around, but i don't know., as long as i want, because i don't like to go back to personal you know attacks, in my arguments i try to keep it on topic, um, and try to explain myself as well as i can, which can become frustrating because i'm not like the best articulator of what i think, um, one of my weaker points i would say, but the last time i had a heated debate, i thought that was the question., um, what happened, i forget the question that i had a heated debate, hmm, last time i had a heated debate, i had a heated debate on, uh the movie boogie nights, um, i was <wa> i didn't lose my temper exactly, but i'm going to be as extremely passionate about, 'cause i don't think it's so good in a movie, but the two people i was arguing with said that it was like one of the, how the best to get best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie, um, they think there are some who are there, as i understand it., they have a certain uh they think that the, like all the stories in boogie nights that they have their own, like each of them could have their own separate stories that they just think it's a whole like, complexity of character in film, and, that somehow like, <sigh> um, what they said, they said like the movie, it's like it's like the end of an era, that makes it like somehow like casino and there's this attention to detail of the in the different character like how they, how they interact in the action, um, something like, uh, yeah, i guess,, i think the heated debate was about like that from there and uh like myself it's not like a bad movie or something, but it's, the, i just don't think dirk diggler is like meaningful < mean> meaningful of a character like i, i think how i get out i came out of the movie because i had seen it many years ago and anyway my opinion about it is basically the same, although as i remember, when i watched it again, i could reevaluate it, there's nothing bad about the movie, there's nothing articulable like articulateable, it's like solid sound acting, you know the direction is good, the camera moves cool, um, that anyway it's really <rea> you know it's cool it's but, but it's meaningless to me it was like meaningless and then too and then there was that led us to discuss because a movie i saw recently that i really did what was django unchained, and they both saw this movie and hated this movie, and then there was this extreme i think, the heated part of the conversation came like, so in the movie django unchained, around you django and django is like a kind he is a two dimensional character, but i don't think that necessarily takes away from what the great, the, the big purpose of the film is, and, and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh, who is like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with said that he, was intelligent and because he was intelligent, he wouldn't have risked his life to save django., or how would have gone into this second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to save django's wife etc., and, and the reason <rea> the reason that they have this argument that like either you buy that he would do that, or he wouldn't, but the reason for their argument is that a smart person would not, sacrifice for someone else, him the stri> who likes me so much, um, how who, how.., she her basic argument was that, altruism <al> as altruism does not exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism does not exist, the only thing you can do is serve <ser> as if the only thing people do is serve them themselves., so it's not quite ayn rand, but it's like the only people thing that people like all people are out to serve themselves, which i don't argue, like, every decision has been like a mixture of altruism and just like even the altruistic kind of decision there may be like nuclei of self interests there, but it made it sound like self interest was the only motivating factor, in and like what, but how terrible is your life, if that's what your ultimate.., purpose <pur> as if you were not like love and sacrifice for other people, so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate, um, and uh, something like yeah and it's uh, so yes, i think that's what i don't think i've necessarily lost my temper., i think i'm losing my temper as more, um, as i just did, so <s> i would be so <s>, back to ad hominem like attacks, um, but i didn't like that.., maybe i was as if i was criticizing <crit> as if i was criticizing her worldview, but it wasn't like, well, you're an idiot, you know, it's like it's not like it hasn't turned into abuse., yeah, i'm glad you understand., an event or an i don't know if i necessarily want to delete something from my memory, i would say a problem i have is not able to remember in as much detail as i want me to remember feelings and moments, not, stories around, as my life does not synchronize <s> always synchronous to a coherent story it is like this moment and this moment and this moment and this moment so, yeah, that's good., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, oh, god, what are you doing?, could it be just one of the toughest decisions, hmm, um, like the choice between two things that it is like, i guess i have a hard time remembering a moment where i like to choose between, two options like no there is no such as sophie wahl art moment in my life, but i think the decision because i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after i lived there for five years was a very difficult one., and uh but i had to do it, for money reasons and because all my core group of friends, were either as abandoned <lea> were most of them going and going other places in the world, and then uh the one other person i was close to was living with someone i couldn't get along with at all, so it was like this situation in which i didn't, i either wanted to live with people i wasn't so close to or craigslist or move home and i think, it was a tough decision to leave i had in fact it was so hard that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would move back, to new york within one or two months, which wasn't what didn't happen, but that was the only way i could, leaving new york, it was how hard it was., or how hard it is, how hard was that?, um, it was hard., <laughter>um, it was it was yes it was just a very similar one, isolating insulation <is>, because also as if i had fallen <fa> as before at that time i had fallen in love with one of my closest friends, and uh, which had somehow gone extreme, bad, and so i didn't talk to her and i couldn't like the whole thing, all on my list of friends who, like more <mo> closer to she was it wasn't quite like her or me type thing, but that was the way that i somehow, i saw it at the time, so i didn't like it., you know, only socially isolated etcetera, yeah, that's good., well, lately it's been awful, um, i don't know., i like two, so i slept ten and a half hours last night., this seems to be the length of time i have to sleep to have really vivid dreams, but before this night, so last not last night but the night before last and the night before i got four hours and two hours of sleep, because i worked on the set and came back., and either and i just couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason., too much energy or something i don't know, tired uh, very, not immediately i think first when waking up as i really enjoy being up early in the morning, and i also stopped drinking caffeine as i had a little coffee in the last two days, but before the last two days i had no coffee in as three and a half weeks so, um, i guess.., with caffeine in my system i'm ready to go, without caffeine, it is, i'm just quieter, i guess., more introverted, since, as in recent times as in, if, um, change in my thoughts yeah i mean, i think if i had just moved here, there was a period of time like, anyway at the beginning, where the, the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to because i moved here because i have a group of friends here or a few friends, but i don't like a large number of friends, and the pressure on, to get out there and meet people and find a job and that pressure was pretty.., overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like, to accept it.., and move you know moves over it i i but not necessarily < nece> you know as if it is still there is still there the pressure is there, but i'm just, you know, you know <sigh> you know <sigh>, no, i'm just.., yes, the last time i felt really happy, maybe we have to go back, um, i think the last time i felt really happy, was uh during the writing process of so last year i made a movie, co written co directed co produced co produced co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co directed co direct, um, and it was kind of like it still consumes my life, but i think during the, writing stages of the film in which we get up bunkers like, eating breakfast, bunkers down work really hard putting stuff on the thing like pure creative, full energy around between me and the person who writes it and, and there's like probably a a day i remember where only i remember going to bed and i was just so excited to work on what i was working on and working with the person i was working with and how, just like, i felt like it yeah i guess that was the, the last time that was like, anyway more than a year ago though, but i think it's hard to believe that i haven't really been happy since then, but if you have a movie like, you can't allow yourself to be really happy <real> especially if you do, you basically know yourself with <wi> with how can't, it's too much to do., i'd say i'm very, acceptance of <acce> as, acceptance from other people, and i'm always very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic around, and, open <o> open <ope> like, enthusiastic about new ideas and open to new ideas and, yeah, i know., hmm, um, i guess i wish i was less uh, uh, less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my, you know, everyday interactions and in my way, um, you know, pleasure for life, to <sigh> yeah i , i would change other things about myself., i would, i don't know <laughter>, hmm, really bad about me, um, i think there are numerous cases in my childhood where my, uh, as every single time there was a problem in school or some kind of, a kind of uh, conflict with a teacher or something that my parents have always been, always on the other side of the court you know how never, i noticed., or noticed when i got older that other people were other parents, as if her child was in trouble, as if something was wrong with, as if her child was perfect, something is wrong with other people, but my parents were always the opposite, especially my mother, so i would say that there are a few cases in which, to me was as accused or as you know, it was my fault when, as what i did like, yeah, it's just things that i couldn't like, there's no yes i don't know, yeah, that's good., ten years ago,, stay staked you know how i think it's about, i have a tendency to, how i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to really get caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and how to devote themselves entirely to it, but sometimes, um, ideas are too easy i would just say as much as possible do as not, don't decide that you.., will only do, one thing to try, as i think i would have recorded, as some do learn to learn to learn the piano to read music, would be a big thing for me to learn to play the drums, i would say i'd like to learn how to play drums and maybe more like acting lessons., um, i've always directed, so i've always directed actors and stuff, but i haven't., it's only now that i don't know that i think, don't.., i don't know that's a tough, hard question., that's it., safe, goodbye., see you.",10
381,"yes, all right., from santa monica, the people, mostly, no, not much., i can't afford to travel as much as i'd like., mm i was an english major, uh i just liked reading a lot at the time so, it sounded like the best thing good to study the funniest thing, not more, oh, i guess my dream job would be,, manage a uh football club, oh, it would be pretty impossible for me, i have no experience <laughter> in this area, i'm very shy., i play music, what do i do if i'm angry?, i don't know., um, what do i do if i'm angry?, i can't think of anything i don't know., i don't think i'm doing anything special., i would say very well, i don't lose my temper very often., when was the last time i had a fight with someone?, i don't remember., yeah, i don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i had a fight with someone., let's see when i.., a small child, i was in front of my grandparents' restaurant., and there was a robbery and i saw it well i saw it when the robbers went, um, yeah, maybe i'd want to erase this from my memory if i could, well, i didn't know what was happening at that moment, so i didn't feel, so bad at the time, but i felt bad afterwards, because then, um, they know my mother was upset that my mother was there, and she had to call the police and it was, it was disturbing to see her., you know, really disturbed, but, at the time when it actually happened, i wasn't really upset, it was more the aftereffects of him, mm it was <wa> it was, < sigh> situation that, i don't know., well, i can imagine that there's probably a million situations that i'd like <laughter> i wish i'd treated differently, i can't think of one in particular, um, maybe, i think when i was a kid,, well, i think that when i was once seeing, well, i've got okay, i've got a good one., um, i didn't marry the girl i should have married., so, that's a big one for me., yeah, good., we were together for about four years, and i think i took her for granted, and i just didn't commit myself., and, that was a long time ago and now it's been so many years that i know i don't know that if it's a realization, but i think now that, yeah, she should've been my wife, who we meant for each other or made for each other., but because, my selfishness and because i just uh, had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i wasn't uh, i didn't do what i should have done, what the smart thing would have been., well, the last thing i can imagine i'd say i felt guilty about was, no i feel a lot of guilt about my friendships i don't feel like i'm so good of a friend, how i could be, but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh, how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help anyone who has a problem i can't, i never feel like i can help anyone., who i know, who has a problem like this, oh, that happens every day i think it happens to everyone i know and everyone, all my relatives and all my friends i don't, i can really give them anything or help them in their lives., well, they're.., it's very far away, it's just, it's very warm and it's very uh, i don't know what it means., it's kept on a very surface level, i don't think they know that i don't think my family really knows me very well, and i don't know her very well, even in one not in a true sense, so, yes, it is., i think a lot of families are like that, but it's, it bothers me that mine is like this, oh, it's very simple, i sleep a lot, and i.., yes, i have no problem sleeping at all, no not really i would say, she's like me, now it's the way i think i've been like this all my life, even when i was a little child, i also slept a lot and, no, i don't think i've changed a lot., mm pretty low, but as i said, in a way i could say, yes i feel really depressed, but then again, i've always been like this, it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently like this, yes, a long, oh, a long time ago, i was.., about ten years old or, around there over, i just missed a lot of school., i didn't want to go to school, so they sent me to, to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh, it went from there, no, i didn't go to therapy., since i was a teenager, all right., i don't feel like it's even helping me., so, one day i just.., decided that i don't want to go anymore, eh, like i said, i don't feel like it helped me., so i guess i don't know it influenced me very much, no, i wouldn't say, disturbing, no, mm, good i feel pretty happy when i see my nephew, and uh i have a, the kids of my best friend are, i feel like they're my nephew and niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them., my ideal weekend would be.., i would travel <tr> i would probably travel i would i, really enjoy just from the city every weekend around, anywhere go really only everywhere from the city, uh just see how different people live and how people are different wherever you go, i really think people are different when you're in different places and, how they interact with you and how they see the world, different foods, um, and i also like historical places i'm in history and i and i enjoy just visiting somewhere that has some kind of, historical significance, oh, i haven't made a trip in a long time., the last trip i really did, i went to france for a wedding a few years ago, and i had a really good time there and i always wanted to go to paris and so i went to paris and then i went to a small town, um, that's a few hours from paris where the actual wedding was, and yes, it was really funny, i think the church where the wedding was uh like a thousand years old so, yes, it was a really cool trip, i don't know what would be considered unforgettable., uh, an unforgettable experience, probably the most memorable experience i guess would be easy, nothing special than living with the girl i just told you earlier that i think now, that we would have, married, um, this is something that remains in my memory, so i say it's unforgettable because, it's still with me and.., it's something i don't think you know well, i know i'll never forget, but it's not just, mm specific day or moment you know, oh, a lot.., i wish i could be healthier., for one thing, uh more energy, and, more friendly good no i think i'm pretty friendly, but more uh more based on more social <s> more uh more social, around these two things mainly i think i would like to get more socially excited and more, and healthier, oh, that's a good question, my best friend, how would my best friend describe me, i think, i think he'd say that i, a very <sigh> good it sounds cheesy, but it <laughter> he would probably say that i am a very spiritual person, and that i give very much i think i'm much more selfish than people think i'm but people think i'm not selfish, um, and probably he would say that i'm creative too, , good my advice to myself, i don't understand the question <laughter>, yeah, but we've already talked about it., i don't think i really believe in being proud or proud., i don't think it's really something you can be proud of, but i can't really think about it., results achieved, anyway, even if i had something <laughter> to be proud of no, i can't think of anything <anythi> some kind of performance i had, uh something i recently did that i really enjoyed, well, i sang karaoke with some friends of mine, <laughter> and i don't usually do that, but, yeah, i had one, it was a lot of fun a few days ago, thank you., nan",16
382,"safe, i'm fine., i'm from columbia south carolina, yep, two thousand four., yeah, that's good., uh once a year for christmas holidays, uh a much slower speed, more , i wanted to perform <perf> to pursue a film degree or i'm sorry to have a film career, yes, it's pretty difficult, but it's uh fun, i always had an interest <inter> interest in uh film and film as uh it seemed like a natural choice for me, uh lasted about a few years, but.., i feel like i've gotten used to it., i like it, it doesn't snow, it's warm weather., and there is much to do with many beaches, uh, transport, and the cost of living is quite high, i've never been outside the u s, but i'd like to someday, uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance, i like listening to music uh making crossword puzzles, reading and hanging out with friends on weekends, very good., hmm, uh, i don't think it was argument maybe < may> maybe a difference of opinion, so it was more like a debate, but it was pretty tame, i think it was a, debate on sport, over a basketball <ba> a basketball game, and uh, i talked to someone on facebook about it., but i think it's good,, to express yourself if you have a disagreement, it's uh, it's natural that you know., not always agree on matters, so, i think talking <ta> is healthy <hea> is healthy, i have a very good relationship with my family. i get along with all my family members and expand that you know cousins and aunts and uncles., so uh, there's no one i've ever had any cracks with., hmm, with my family, hmm, i probably could have been more disciplined than i grew up., and, more, uh, more discipline with schoolwork and homework that somehow something, but for the most part i had a good childhood and there's not much i would change about it., hmm, probably leave my comfort zone in uh south carolina to move out here, that was pretty, hard, but at the same time it was, uh exciting, so it was a bittersweet feeling, um, a lot of excitement mixed with uh some fear, but it uh, it went away pretty fast, safe, no better at school uh when i was in high school, i could have been a more diligent worker, and i could have done a little better., hmm, i always had a strong support <s> uh family support system, and uh parents and uh siblings, so, this is definitely a positive thing., hmm, an event, uh, probably going back to school, i wish i had uh, i wish i'd done better at school, so if i could take something back from my past, it would be, uh scholastically related <sch> scholastic, it's pretty simple, when i don't sleep well, i tend to, kind of laxadaisic and uh, just tired all day kind of groggy, uh, no, everything's pretty much the way it usually is with me., i felt pretty good., no, i didn't., no, i didn't., the last time i felt really happy around, i made a lot of money a few weeks ago and i feel like i'm ahead of the game, with you know, with the rent under control and a lot of bills out here so, i'm still somehow having the lasting impact of this happiness, yeah, that's good., uh, if i, when i have money, i tend too much uh, uniform, not evenly tempered, but i tend to feel better about things, and more optimistic, and this city is so about your finances it always makes you feel good to be before the game, and uh to have, have sources of income, uh, i think i'm creative, and i think i'm a good listener, hmm, to be as disciplined and focused as possible, because if you're out of your, parental homes and their lives must be, the better you're in school and the better you are, the better you are., as far as discipline is concerned, the more pleasant your life will be and, much eh uh, your life will be much easier, hmm, let's see., i wish i were more, disciplined, but i'm working on it and i've gotten much better, at the, it's become pretty easy, i think i'm just getting older around i'm from my twenties now so, i definitely saw a change when i first got out of here., hmm, um, some people tend to say that my decision to move here was not feasible and a kind of pipe dream, so somehow i felt bad, but, uh i kind of take insults in step and around sometimes i'm welcome, constructive criticism, because some things aren't right with you that you're not aware of until it's mean and it comes from the right place, i think it might be an invaluable uh tool that you know what to hear, what other people do, must say that this could be negative, hmm, likely to be optimistic and, um, are optimistic and, uh helpful, my ideal weekend uh, i'd like to go to vegas and make a road trip with three or four friends, you know, packed in the car and only uh many disposable income, and you know good weather, i probably haven't been to vegas in five years, but.., um, i went to casinos with my brother, and that's a lot of fun sometimes., uh, i am proud that i have come back a long way when i first moved here, i am much more disciplined, um, i read a lot, uh, i'm doing crossword puzzles, and i think i have, i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and i'm going after what i want, hmm, i'm not a big fan of high taxes, um, but it doesn't really make me angry it makes me frustrated and uh, i guess i'll take it in step but, uh, i had a friend in my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun., it was a documentary., a sport < s> a sport, safe, goodbye.",0
383,"yes, i'm totally fine it's confidential or not you know my words <where> my words are all going wild <laughter>, i'm doing pretty good hanging out of nice weather around i just had a recent change of feeling right now looking at you < laughter> the digital you that i say uh i don't know it's yes it's funny, um <tisk> because i always thought that uh the transmission of emotions or feelings uh, be understood as better with a human interaction in contrast to a non human being like yourself, yeah, that's good., i, i think you see what i mean <laughter> i'm born from around and grew up in los narrowes venice area mar vista specifically around, that's where i came from., uh, good., there's a lot more i don't like, but what i like is, that the public transport comes uh, that the idea of, sure you know medical drugs like marijuana is a widely used you know topic very, thought of and i feel, the deep culture of los angeles is why i stay here and pursue my art because there is a lot to do., there is a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand < laughter> yeah, um, good the, the human mentality here is about, is very hectic very chaotic, you know a lot about, the vehicle the car the highway, and this idea that we, a loop you know, yes, it's a very, it's very hectic., atmosphere human atmosphere, the, is not very beneficial for a, supporting loving community to help one another, yeah, that's good., well, i can't see your shoes <laughter> but i love to travel i love hiking i love surfing swimming cycling riding rides uh <laughter> i love to travel yeah, um, from my travels it's not like, well, i enjoy a lot of things about traveling, but, it's more like what to do i, it's just more like i enjoy not being, trapped in the city with all these, made ties and restrictions i enjoy, travel, because, i get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux picture, you know that man made a picture that he's here., so i love traveling because i get out of this and see the world as it is, thank you., would you, <laughter> okay <laughter>um, well, i.., a type of recent last year went to, los banos central california region, and although it wasn't so far from l a, it was completely different energy around there were no phones, there was no wifi there is no t v, there was.., there was the mind there was a relative mind, in the sense that , people were not diluted and get all this input from digital media and, outer influence people were just raw real and walking and chilling i worked in a hot spring resort, and i just got to breathe and walk, and farm and do a lot of carpentry, yeah, that's good., not hard, you don't even think of trouble when you do things you really love and enjoy, so it wasn't, um, i guess what i described about the city, i just wanted to.., get out of here and, type of, kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real deal yeah, uh, good., at the moment i'm studying, currently i'm studying physiotherapy i'm about to become a licensed massage therapist, but before that yeah kind of cool, but before that i was too, , to for music composition, so i wrote only scores for, films animations dance productions theatre productions, things like that yes it was cool it was funny trippy, very trippy, but it was cool, but i had to leave this because, study migrations, until you know that up to fifty thousand per year for as a four year b f a, is not the deal not trying,, fall me with these chains of federal loans, so yes., hey, that's not a good word, that's annoying <laughter>, dream job , my dream job would be, everything i can do to, alleviation of this uh metropolitan, like cities from, the nightmare they put in my dream is to ease the nightmare that is my dream,, stimulate dream back in, the modern human world, and with you know physiotherapy and artistic expression, i've got a few., great ideas <laughter> yeah, um, i think i'm going out more just like i just experience things so outgoing yeah, <laughter> i thought that was really funny about what i do to relax is uh, just breath it cool off maybe a smoothie or some tea and i go cycling write yes, hmm, pretty good, i guess i didn't, screaming in a long time, um, well, it wasn't argue that i didn't really argue much i just like to say my opinion, and have been understood and i like the person i talk to say their, opinion and have understood it, so the last time that had happened, i guess yesterday i cooled down in downtown with a friend from new york and we talked about writing and basically we weren't arguing, but talking about opinions and that sometimes, things are not ready to be written, yeah, so yesterday., hm, guilty, that's hard, i didn't have that feeling in a long time guilt, what about you feeling guilty?, all right., mm, i don't really wish i could erase everything from my memory, because then it would just, be like, i would feel that something was missing from my present life if, something just deleted you know butterfly effect somehow yes, hmm, um, maybe the time, , she wanted to go to school, i took the year off and i was just, we had an apartment with another friend., and it has not surrendered, you don't know all, nothing turns out as it is thought, and that's kind of the nice thing about it, but this one turned out to be a little bit, uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it was and, i thought it was funny, but yes, it ended with me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended., yeah, if we split up, but that's something i want., maybe i've been a little more thoughtful, the toughest decision, what are you doing?, hm maybe not the most difficult, but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school my uh continuation of achieving a b f a, yeah, that could have been the hardest., um, it's just.. i don't know., i mean, of course, money money is the motto money is a great theme tutorial walks around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support < s> no fan of support that, but.., yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons i don't support these crazy tution hikes and.., but another reason why i, decided to leave, i had to make a hard decision to decide was to leave, also because to art institute you know about this is a, this is a funny idea in itself and basically i was a musician, to be taught by a musician, to, making music, and the same with you all know the dancers or the theater students you know learn dance to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know, and it's just.., yeah, it's just not, as artistic as i thought, art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not from out there you know so yeah, hm, if i, if i, it's kind of easy, i mean, it depends on you knowing if i remember doing some chamomile tea or if i.., remember to breathe and go through my mantras or, remember to do my pre like dream therapy work, then i can get into it really nice to, but if i only blinded with all my thoughts then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah, to basically just breathe what i said or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i know the lucky chance, uh meditated by you, a nice, a nice indica around then you really know that indica put me down pretty nice, pretty sleepy, so a lot of things breathe you know mm you know medicinal herbs uh, like chamomile and cannabis and, just relieve me of bad bad juju <laughter>, mm, i don't guess if i don't think of anything., i felt, kind of like this kind of just cruise on one on a gray line, but it's a beautiful gray it's a really nice shade, some people wouldn't like it, but i really like it and it's uh, it's stable., yeah, it's comfortable, yeah., no, i didn't., not from a certified doctor, no, but no, i have not <laughter>, um, yeah, i mean, i just think like the whole, you know, like you said, p t s d depression and you know others you know mental instability, i think, everyone is depressed i think everyone is overjoyed i think everyone is angry, i think everyone is shy, everyone is socially all at the same time you know it's just, different days different you know variants different swimmers different boats you know different, waves different waves around so yeah i think, i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know everything, but only on different variants different swimmers, really happy, um, i mean, i feel very happy., uh and i feel very sad, but really happy was uh i guess, maybe this morning, if i just ride here just enjoy the sun enjoying the breeze, cycling, yes, it's <laughter>, well, i have a lot of best friends and they all describe me quite differently, but based on this same idea, that maybe i'm just getting to the point, just some kind of aquarius, i guess., well, i'm twenty one, so twenty years ago <laughter> i would have told myself to stay a baby uh young, and don't lose sight, you know, don't stop listening, let things happen again and again, don't let them happen, be, to be a beautiful baby that i would have told myself or yes to be a beautiful baby, mm, um, well, i guess recently what was shown to me uh by me, is to work my ability, with others and i speak mainly from an artistic point of view with which i have worked a lot., artists working on many different mediums mixed media projects and, i am very well with it and with other peoples and melts of our ideas together, yeah, that's good., mm, that's a strange question like, um, like that's gonna get me to lure me out., who know a moment that i remember today and think about it as if it were a past glory that i cannot fulfill today, so i think the most proud moment of my life is hanging with you right now, yes, thank you very much., mm, it's interesting about my immediate family is uh, mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in south asia, just a kind of backpack around uh younger sis she's really chill she somehow makes music too and we just hang together, we're really cool mommy mommy i'm really chilly with love her to death, she'll get me and dad., um, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, he doesn't understand me, but, i love the art he makes he makes crazy painting and i kind of get him through that but

good weather of the ocean, and there's always something to do, hm uh, transport, sometimes, new places to see uh and new people to visit, a few years ago i went to the catalina islands for my birthday, i've been to the catalina islands all day., i took a boat there., uh, hopping on the plane and leaving indiana forever, all right., sleep, uh, to be a filmmaker, because it's a job i haven't had yet, not too hard, shy, hm, because of my past, for the, simply have difficulty finding new friends and, just let people trust, all right., uh t v watch or go to the movies, i really don't have a temper., when i was sixteen, my stepfather, because of the nightmares i had., i was just having nightmares about my childhood., about my involvement in my biological father, so far, i have no idea if they are or not., go for a walk or drive., uh maybe a few days ago, i just walked around the block a few times., pushing people away, uh, i guess,, try to trust them a little more, let her in my life a little more, well, that would be easy, that would be the first half of my life, it would be easier to start a new life if i can't remember my old one <laughter>, uh, really i mm all my decisions is not so hard that i try to avoid stress and everything so that i don't really make hard decisions, uh, good every time i push someone away i wish i'd treated all these situations differently, uh good uh whenever someone interferes too much in my life <volve>, i always say or do something so they want to stay away from me, that's what this is all about., depending on the type of person they are, i really don't have a relationship with my family, i know i have a sister somewhere in vegas., one half of a brother in indiana, my stepfather's in arizona., except that i have no relationship with any of them, um, we really don't talk., so it's kind of hard to talk about her., edgar cayce, well he died far before i was born and i only know him like books and documentaries, uh really not so easy around, i, usually you usually take me like a few hours to finally get to sleep as soon as i lay in my bed, uh well basically i try to lie down i have stressful < s> race or stressful thoughts, a few times i could even try to listen to music for an hour just to see if it calms me down, stressed, and just yeah just basically a little stressed, well, i've been feeling a little bit excited lately and, i just wish my life was different, i wish i had friends and loved ones and all this and i wish i had a real relationship and everything, but i didn't, well, lately, i've been living, i'm moving a bunch of stuff., things from my stress <st> life stressful things like, invoices and what not, and try to keep it simple, uh, to make sure that there is the least amount of stress in my life by, only, simply remove different things from my life and try to integrate new things, yes, i guess we're number sixteen., nightmares, uh held back for a while because it got too stressful, well, basically, i just.., i pushed her like i was getting rid of her from my life because i didn't feel like they were really listening to me or anything., and uh, yes, so i just didn't feel too much useful help from them, so i was looking for alternative means, uh good, basically like music and, force me to like different social events, yes, depressive, mm only, but basically just depressed uh keep me locked in, don't talk to anyone, uh, uh, i guess a few days ago, okay, well, basically, i feel that the best way to keep people in my life is, with fake people in my life through online multiplayer games with avatars, and user names and everything and, i'm just having a little fun, go with these avatars in virtual worlds, and talk to people like that, so they don't know who i really am, you don't even know my real name., okay good my ideal weekend uh let me see, is uh if i don't work this weekend, i'm going to get up maybe like starbucks or a mcdonalds go, get something online while eating or drinking, maybe play an online multiplayer game for a little while, and then later in the day maybe go to a movie, whatever it is that's playing, uh go somewhere else relax watching something t v, um, and maybe a d v d film and, um, or i could spend the day driving all day to a place where i haven't been before, or it's been a long time since i, just try to spend the day in this area, and only, yeah, that's the weekend., my life, i just regret how my life developed, i wish i had a normal stable life., uh, let me see ten twenty years ago, i was special, uh, i'd just tell myself to keep a diary or something., basic, tell me yourself., how my life will develop now, so that hopefully the other i will make other decisions, oh my mind, well, i wish i was a little healthier, i wish i had looked a little better, i wish my vision was, much better., and i wish i had a bunch of people in my life i could call friends, um, i'm a fucking genius, i could, everything i'm good at, i've learned to teach myself., so basically, i can't get a career in this kind of stuff unless i go to school for it, but, it's hard., it's basically easier when i teach myself than taking a kind of class to do it, and everything, because, yeah basically <bay> yeah just basically, the fact that i'm a fucking genius okay, thank you., have a nice day",15
385,"yes, all right, how are you?, the angels, weather, entertainment, transport, no, also <t> too many people, enterprises, uh just fun to do, yes, about nothing much to talk about, maybe i'll talk to you., to be fairly good environment, pretty good, the centre, sleep, i don't know., i don't remember., no, nothing., i don't know i can't remember., to bad people, you only know bad people who put things back, car accidents, mm does not know any of them, i don't really know,, no one., no, no, something fine, just waking up thinking, no, i don't know., no, i don't know., i don't remember., i don't know how to talk to you., the first time i've done this before., i have no idea., sleep, not too much, nothing, i have no experience., i don't know if i'm sure., to be just a nice person, not safe, not much, no, i don't know., i don't know., i don't know., sporting, basketball, last month mm, goodbye.",8
386,"yes, oh well a little tired, but uh i found out that my thyroid is i think so <laughter>, i was born in canada, and but i have lived most of my life in california so, and it's gray today, too, so the gray weather makes you kind of sluggish, the < slaughter>, oh, my god, years and years ago, i don't think i've been back a long time., well, air fares have risen quite sharply in recent years, so gas prices have risen., traveling as much as it is a fun thing to do, it's expensive, so, uh huh, oh let's see, everything has plus and minus for cold weather <laughter> not so much sun, so i think i'd rather have more sun and the warm weather so but different from the, it is very pretty back there natural landscape and, but i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy, but that's a little thing, with, so, mhm, why did i move to l a because my family came here and started, uh my dad has a job here and, that became our home base and uh, that's why, easy very easy so, uh huh, uh good at high school you're generally studying ed yeah it's they've set courses and then after that, went to college and i was a business major, let's see, i was a veterinary major <laughter>, and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so, um, i don't know., can't really determine why <laughter>, so, i worked in social services, but i also worked in sales and most recently i do real estate, i'm a leasing consultant part time, i mean, everything has plus and minus it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives, oh, likely to work as a uh gossip columnist at, t m z or any of these networks < laughter>, but as you know, everything in the entertainment business is very competitive, it's who you know so much, but that would be my dream job or probably work with uh cats you know animals, so, i'm very starting in fact, i think i'm going out so, i scare people sometimes there's a lot of rest, you know the reserved people out there, so i'm some kind of east coast very you know i go to people and talk to them very socially, oh, my god, there i could do hundreds of things i could read, i could watch a show that turns on the music is great to, go for a walk, uh, call my friends., millions of things <laughter> like this, i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean, you know, of course, if you drive in l a and someone, cuts in front of you sometimes this can be irritating, but i'm actually pretty i'm not the kind of person who fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so, mhm, mm, i can't remember., as i said, there are not very many arguments usually i, avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so, i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> now or that i can imagine, mm, i can't think of anything right now., i, i really can't think of any decisions that were really tough, i mean, most of them are pretty easy for me to make a decision, so i don't have a family, so if i need to know that i had to move to san francisco once to have a job, but, since i'm single, i don't really have to consider other people and children and, this kind of thing, so it somehow makes certain things easier if you don't have to look at family, mm, yeah, that's good., an event, hmm, well, obviously you don't know that a family member you know you want everyone to be there forever., so i know when my father died, you know, i mean,, i wish i had had him much longer, i mean, he died at the age of seventy seven and you know, would have been nice to have him a little bit more, but, you know you can't control these things that life has to do with., the, so, mhm, yes, there are <laughter> yin and yang who are old uh, philosophy and it really applies there is a plus a minus and negatives and positives, so, as i said, my father is no longer here and my mother and i know you have our differences i think moms and daughters always do, around my brother and i understand myself well i see him a lot i see < s> my sister works a lot, i see her, and you know we're talking, and she has her own life and her kids i know well with., so, mhm we have a small family, uh <laughter> once again it's like this is a difficult question to answer, there are so many, guys of kids out there, i think, most of them seem pretty dazed, i mean, you know, there's always gonna be kids who kind of got out of control., but.., i don't know the ones i saw recently, they're very, well dizzy, so can not say much more about it, now <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in an apartment, but.., there's someone living above me, i'm on the first floor and there's someone on the second floor and they're pretty quiet, but.., they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have a lot of energy around them will usually shower around midnight and sometimes they will start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes, run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't, yes and i need eight hours of sleep and i just got, oh, i'd say maybe six hours, and then i usually wake up at night, because sometimes they're just.., about two or three o'clock in the morning, they're either walking around or i hear something like that., i don't exactly get eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>, but there aren't, like i said, things you can't control when you're living in an apartment, you know, i mean, the lady's very quiet it's just that she's got a habit,, you know, under later showers <laughter> wash laundry at night, that is, i can't tell her about it., so, yeah, but you know there are people who are in worse situations, so i don't make much of it, you know it, and i don't like every night, but you know it., at least twice a week, so i know i may have to sleep in another room, but, for now, you know i'm gonna deal with this, like,, tired <laughter> very tired and hard to concentrate hard to concentrate it only takes longer to do things because i don't have my energy too i didn't train i usually try to go about half an hour a day, but, the weather was a little colder and a little drier so, you know, i'm not so motivated when the weather's kind of blah, so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours of sleep, mhm, uh, like i said, uh, tired <laughter> i'm, it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles at the moment we have very gray days i live very close to the sea, so the sun doesn't get out so much, so i don't get my serotonin <laughter> i need the, i um, i can't get my eight hours of sleep because you know,, whatever and i think my thyroid's too high, so that's kind of, create you know i have some vitamin deficiency, and, you know, as soon as the sun comes out, i'm kind of more energetic it just gives you more energy like this., not mm mm, no, i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person, and i like to be other people i mean, of course, i like my private time, but i like it to be people pretty much so, hmm, i mean, i usually enjoy everything i do, there's nothing that stands out more than anything else., no, i never regret anything, uh huh, what advice would i have given well, i guess i could probably change things around me thinking it, i probably would have had another college major., you know, it seems like <laughter>, uh what else around me probably not with certain men <laughter>um, waste of time with certain people, i don't know that these are the things that come to mind, maybe started saving money earlier you know these kinds of things, but, mm, spend a lot of fun with to uh just be a good friend to have people like me for a friend i'm loyally trusting and uh, i hear i'm a good listener, i'm very patient <laughter> and so, mhm, good <laughter> number one would be to lose weight, but, i think this is a worldwide problem, i mean, there's a lot of food around and temptations and, especially here in america are many of us couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we, you know it's easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you you need to talk yourself into it so, this is the weight you know will also give you more energy when you lose weight, so that's a big thing than good, but that's probably just the weight thing yeah, mhm, i think you'd have asked me that question before <laughter>., but if you want, i'll repeat it., i'm very uh, like i said, i'm very loyal when i tell people that i'm going to do something that i'm very reliable., uh, i'm warm, i'm very friendly, i'm a great listener., and i know i've got so many people telling me that they just like with me, like i said i'm very i'm pretty optimistic you know i'm, i'm not gonna let things get me down too much., hmm, this is a difficult question <laughter>, i can't believe i mean, i'm, i can't imagine answering that <laughter> so <laughter>, for fun good i love movies i could see every movie they make around, i love to go out with my friends, shopping swapmeets around my gosh and travel is great road trips, um, that's kind of, you know, part of it yes that i mentioned so, traveling always to see different places the history aspect of him, to enjoy the food food in different countries, uh the architecture, it's just kind of neat to get away and see a completely different place, mhm, okay well <laughter> i've been around, to many places in europe i love paris uh it's such a hiking town you can, whoever designed the city, i'm telling you, i mean, you can get from one point to another the subways are great to, each area has its own distinctive type of there is the latin quarter in which the students are, there is another area where the fashion designers.., like our rodeo ride here in beverly hills, there is an area that more africans <af> africans and they have swapmeets on weekends that are wonderful for international, and then, as i said, when you get out of paris, there's so much history that you can see the other way around, there are other palaces that you can go to the south of france., but this is probably my favorite country, which i was also in italy., uh, yes well after college people usually i mean people who go to college or either before or after college, this is a great time to go to europe because you're young and not tied up you don't have a family and, you have a more adventurous mind that you have more energy, so you know, carrying backpacks or suitcases isn't a big deal around, so yes, that's, mhm, yeah, that's good., mhm, thank you., goodbye.",11

here, mm transport, um, only so many sometimes too many people, but apart from that, i'm generally happy here, photography and linguistics, mhm, i love photography, i was always interested in it and i also studied it in high school, so i wanted to learn more about it, and with languages i come from a mixed background, so i wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic origin, it wasn't hard, it was a passion, so i enjoyed it., i'm not no., to make photography full time and also do some of the things i'm passionate about creative creative things, i have an idea i would like to make a few < s> some robe < r> ah like a robe line around women robes and things like this, mhm, i have already traveled a bit and i enjoy <en> i love traveling, to see different cultures different countries around, meeting new people, all this, and the language, i lived in greece for around <tisk>, over a year i taught english there and around <sniffle> i moved around to different parts of greece and uh really had a great time, i think.., only with my group of friends i met there and go through with the experience with them, i think one of my most memorable experiences was making elafonisos with everyone in a car and spending a fantastic time., yeah, that's it., i think i'm shy to start with and to start and when i meet people, then i'm much more outgoing, photography and linguistics, , rest in the bed, watching a movie in bed, this is probably one of the things i like to do to relax, i think very good <laughter>, it was probably with my friend.., uh with regard to money questions, i must feel guilty because i don't generate as much income as i need now., i just have a few fights in my career., and financially it will be very difficult, yes, it was difficult, but i have worked very hard to fix that <sigh>, all right, i'm here and i'm doing this focus study that i'm doing to generate a lot of things to make more money that works harder but looks for other ways to generate money outside my career., um, probably raped, no, no, sometimes, not that i know of., , i felt like i was., <deep breath> felt stressed and worried, i don't seem to have a problem with that <laughter> i seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night, mhm, around grumpy and and lethargic and around in the morning, i wish i were going around differently., um, i really can't imagine anyone right now., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, it was probably to decide not to have a child, well, i was pregnant and.., was not sure if i should continue the pregancy around, and that was also due to financial burden and, the father with whom i was involved did not want the child, so i made this very difficult decision, hmm, i know when i went around cancun to go on a holiday around the new year around new year period new year holiday, i felt absolutely fantastic i felt happy i felt relaxed around, i felt as if i had no worry in the world temporarily, um, eh free, i wish i could.., be a little stronger and more confident, definitely more confident, i'd say i'm a wonderful friend., um, if i love someone you know, i love her very much family of friends., friend, so i think it's good that i'm very loyal as a friend., i'm honest, i'm taking care of people., um, i'm fun to be with, so i think these are some of my best qualities, <deep breath> about my relationship with my family around my father is not so great, my parents were divorced when i was young, and he was somehow in and out of my life you know forever., mostly from, so that's not fantastic, but it's something i'm used to, so it's not, as painful as it would have been if he had been there and then i lost him, but it's still.., it's still not the best situation, i mean, i still wish this could be fixed somehow, , so there are good and bad relationships in my family, , someone who's been there for me since i was very young, and was always incredible and i love her so much, <deep breath> ten or twenty years ago, i would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun, so i don't have to work so hard now, i am very sorry that i regret not taking my career seriously earlier, because now it's.., it was much harder., um, i think it took the kids to the pier and spent a wonderful time with them, and make her happy, this was probably a great time at one of the best times in the last weeks, , and uh, and they're great kids., no, i think they're a challenge., it's harder because they're stepchildren, so there's some.., times when i don't know exactly how much to be involved and how much to not be involved, but i'm very happy because they're really good kids, they tend to fight a lot, but.., but i, but it's not as difficult as i think some other parents have it, mhm, to make it a conscious effort, not to, <laughter> not to punish her or to overstretch her, i make a conscious decision not to yell at her as i was screamed, i was often screamed as a child., and it was really it was really difficult, so make sure i don't do that, i think i'm very proud of the fact that i was able to, traveling to the world around, and live in other places many other places around the country and around the world, and, the fact that i have learned several languages, um, and the fact that i am able to keep, really long long relationships with my friends, thank you., goodbye.",7
396,"yes, all right., virginity, i wanted to live somewhere else than virginia with a little more variety, um, once a year maybe, it's.., it's much slower and there's much less to do, i wanted to live somewhere else and, a nicer warmer climate and around somewhere where there is much more to do and, there's a lot more going on., it was really easy for me because i wanted something <someth> it was very different and i wanted something different, i like.., i like to do all the things, like the museums i like, the beaches and the mountains and all, hiking and doing all the free things, people don't appreciate what they have here, they just want to come here and take something with them, but they don't want to give anything back., bad drivers, not as much as i'd like., travel whenever i can, but usually it can not afford that much, mm, well, i like to take, i like taking pictures and i like it, new places to explore my wife and i like to see, flora and fauna and migration and, monuments and only different areas to see, um, we're good., we went to central california, where we would like to go., more international places, but that takes a while to afford, so we went more local, so we went to, um, we went to hurst castle and to see the sea lions around, the, elephant seals and things like that, um, i guess our uh, i guess our palm springs trip to our anniversary we have the, eh we have the tram and a nice hotel and jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall, i guess somewhere in between, english and film, well, i.., they told me i had to go to college and i hadn't quite decided what to do., chose something i would like to do for the time, all right., i wish i had, not put under pressure, so i had more time to find out what i wanted, i might have done something else like physiotherapy, but, uh no i've been teaching <t> gymnastics that's something i do earlier, um, i didn't have to starve, and, i did it, i'm not as bad as i thought it would be i went for it and it ended up kind of fun, dream is to have money and not have to work for it, overall pretty good, um, i don't remember what, but it would probably have been, a few weeks ago with my wife, well, everyone i ever really upset and, scream, i always wish i wouldn't, but sometimes when someone doesn't listen, it makes me crazy, you know if i'm just.., to say something over and over and they just don't listen, it makes me really angry, to <sigh>, i don't know, i spend a lot of time with them, but, i don't know what the most difficult thing is, because if i decide to go with something, you know it's usually for good reason., well, i think i feel guilty about moving to california and leaving my family in virginity, i mean,, i know i shouldn't, but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like it, living there, you know, i'm the one who moved away, so it's like i left her., well, i mean,, i don't miss virginia, but i miss her, so i guess a little hard, i have a good relationship with my wife and my parents in law with my mother and sister., no problems, everyone gets along well, mm very close, um, i mean something <anyth> anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise, it depends on how much exercise i have, a lot of exercise it's pretty easy if i don't, um, just like now a little bit, slow and out of it, but, not really.., otherwise too different, um, i just walked down 'cause my.., my mother in law dies and we spent three days., in the hospital and we will go back after this, so not much time to, sleep, mm, just.., just slower <sl> only slower and, tired and, that's all., no, no, um, usually only if i have <havi>, having a fun day either alone or with my wife is pretty easy for me to just be outside and, and uh and hiking or exercising it's not hard for me, i'm not sure if.., maybe, of a width not exceeding 3 mm, eccentric, but in a good way, i hope, no, um, to, be careful with your, to be careful with your, work to make sure you don't get hurt and to, i don't know, just your normal, your normal type of, uh older type of wisdom <sigh>, mm not much to say really everyone recognizes things when they get older that they want they had when they were younger, i wish i could get rid of my back injury so i could get back in shape like i used to, that's.., the biggest thing at the moment, um, not much to say, just hurt my back at work and, i just like to come by because it's, you know you're keeping me from doing a lot of things that are everything., to do well as i used to uh gymnastics and trampoline and used to be much more active or exercise and now i can only exercise a little because it hurts too much, um, likely to be the same as during the, during the day go on a hike or in a park with my wife and, uh, enjoy pictures and wildlife and movement and then, in the night, you know, we're watching a movie or going dancing or, just something like that, um, very proud of the, i mean, i came here without knowing anyone., i was at a point where i could stay in virginia and feel comfortable and, you know, in the end, i did something that i regretted, but i came out and i always thought

always been like this, but i've learned to do it well, if you argue, i suppose you mean words uh, with my youngest daughter it was about one and a half years ago, well, it was because of an incident that i didn't like what the, the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her that she, extremely defensive and instead of dealing with it, she became angry at me

hand to you if he thought it would disappoint you., revenge my mother <sigh> my father uh was a tough guy, but i loved him, uh, i never felt abused by him, but i mean, i remember saying that if you're able to kick my ass, you can leave this house., that's mine, that's kind of the basis of our relationship, my mother, my children my big children, well, i'm one of three sons of mine., so i really didn't have any experience with women except uh with my mother in terms of knowing you're related, and my grandma, and when my first daughter was born, it was like wow < snort> that it was that i fell madly in love with, has changed my life, yeah, that's how it happened., uh.., when my mother got sick i wasn't there for her as i should have been, and i don't feel well <goo>, oh yeah, you can always fix what you did at the end <snort>, i was just in a really bad situation, but that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there as i did., at least not in my head, uh.., uh my second marriage probably she uh, she wanted to have uh kids and i already had my kids with my first wife, and uh, i had told her at first that i didn't want to have children and you know i had three, uh that and i was good with it and she hinted that she didn't want any children, so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant, and changed our relationship and, i wouldn't basically give in and we were finally divorced, i don't know that i would have had children., would have had children with her, but i, i wasn't very flexible., what should be flexible, i don't know., sometimes i'm sometimes i'm not, uh, that stopped me., pulling my father out of life support, i kept going back to something he said to me when i was younger., that he would come back and haunt me, and, when i know if i leave him there and suffer, it took me a while to convince my two other brothers, but that's what we did., something i could erase from my memory, to be locked up for a while., i want to delete this from my memory <snort>, it's just, it's a daily hell, where there is very little humanity, and uh, you even do some things you're not proud of, i've never slept, i've never slept much, and i'm one of those people when i wake up, i'm having a hard time falling asleep again., so it's difficult <diffi> it's uh, i'm pretty much the same, i'm not changing., so i had a friend <f> uh, things are good with the children and grandchildren except for the small incident with my granddaughter <granddaugh> uh my youngest daughter, but i recently had a friend who uh, run over on a crosswalk and he's on, he's on life support, so i didn't feel so good., it influenced me., it wasn't like he was yaywalking or anything he literally ran on the crosswalk, and the guy never took the break., and he's at this point on life support, mm not really just consistent thing about me i'm very inconsistent, uh no, no, but i had moments where i felt i was i was depressed, okay, i talked when you were talking, so i didn't hear the question., yesterday., had a conversation with my fourteen year old granddaughter, i'm happy to have moments of happiness every day because i'm either talking to you or, sms with my daughters and granddaughters every day, whether or not they are , we're mad at each other., oh, i have a lot of regret, uh, i should have studied law., that's kind of something i thought, yes, started thinking about more in my life, i was accepted i just didn't have other things i thought i wanted <snort>, uh <sigh> uh i played with uh wants to be uh a football kicker in a football team, had some tryouts things like that, but they have not whistled out, and since that didn't work out, i kind of lost my desire to become a lawyer., so i just did other things, i don't think it would make so much difference that i probably wouldn't listen to myself <snort>, around about me uh <hums>, uh, i could be uh, if i don't like you, i could be very difficult., if i don't like you, i'd like to change that., it has in the past yeah <snort>, well, i have this theory that you could only make me bad at me if i gave you, and i'm not really big on letting people do that to me, uh although my first wife, if, when she left me with the kids, you knew it was my fault., and i wasn't sure i believed that, but i knew i was an ass, and uh, but i probably believed it and not in its entirety, but in parts <snort>, <sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judging uh uh i'd listen to anyone, uh, whether i agree with you or disagree with you, uh, i taught myself., control anger that i've got, that i've got, uh, and if i called you my friend, or if i told you i loved you, then i'm serious that i'm not doing something i'm doing., incidental, <snort> uh oh okay well i played eighteen holes golf with a, with an old dear friend and we were caught and, uh.., we spent four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner, met his new wife uh had a good time, many memories came back, mm, i like my children, my grandchildren., i don't know if all children are like that, i think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology, but, but i'm mostly because i don't., but if my grandchildren are any samples of it, i think they're good, i think they're pretty good., raising my girls, basically alone with the help of my mother, i think this is the proudest, or, okay, nice chatting with you, see you.",5

ever had to make was, man i really don't know, um, my father has to go through the surgery and see how he suffers., well, he had a tumor he had to remove., so it was just hard to see him in bed and just be in the hospital if he really didn't want to be there because he's a real living person and he'd rather run around and stuff, but just seeing him stuck in bed was just awful, uh me and my family aren't very close we're not, i mean, they were always there for me and i appreciate it, but we never had this close connection < collection> connection <con> connection around, especially since they're strangers so they don't really understand where i'm trying to get out, have grown up, america so it is quite different when it comes to these cultural <cu> racially i mean the cultural boundaries that we somehow take a step across each other's feet on, but apart from that, we have a decent relationship when we talk to each other, it's kind of embarrassing, but it's okay., i think they're out of control., i think they're learning things they shouldn't know at this age, i think they're doing things they shouldn't do, and i don't feel that enough people are telling them they shouldn't, i feel like they're applauded, from the media they are applauded by celebrities to whom they follow, and there's not enough done, and they just get lost, depends on the night on some nights, it's pretty hard for me to fall asleep like a baby., usually creative actually, if i can't sleep, i just stay up and write something or read a book and ideas will pop up., these things are usually good when i can't sleep, it's nothing bad because i have bad thoughts or something., to lately between a mix of good and bad i have my happy moments when i'm energetic and i'm live, then a few nights a few days where i'm just you know, just sit there, only gently thinking, not like my life itself, i don't know that it's always been the case that these ups and downs always have, but they balance each other., no, no, the last time i felt really happy was, hm, today, from the moment i woke up, it was a beautiful sunny day., i, went to a few friends we had a good time in school, had some good grades on some papers to write a good essay, feel quite successful and, i feel like my day is just, a good day, my best friend would describe me as strange <laughter>, most people would describe me as strange, i say a lot of strange things that i do strange things that i'm interested in things that most people aren't., um, just like old literature, for revolutionary stuff, uh things about the change of the world, but, by subterranean means, um, no, i don't live a life of regret, fear can never stop you from doing something, um, i'm just reading around with some friends., ride around and find something to do just on an adventure, i don't wish i could change something about myself, i just wish i could build myself into the person i really should be., um, this once i and my best friend got into an argument, and she pointed to all the things i've done, that i shouldn't have done, all at once, how i hurt the people, how i hurt them, the wise men i've done to them who have been brutal, and it just made me feel bad when i reflect on everything, my parents, i mean, although we don't see eye to eye, they always bring me to this realization that i need at the end of the day, although i never listen to her or i don't choose to listen to her, when it happens, i learned from it and i'm like oh that's what my parents told me, so i learned to trust them more and i learned,, understand that they are wiser than me and they know more than me, i don't travel so much around l a anymore, try to see new sights, but as far as i don't travel outside, to discover new things to discover things you never knew they were there, or the limitless possibilities, to discover i like to discover new people, new cultures, new things that go against the normal for us and for me, a few days ago, i just drove into the middle of the desert, and i just sat there, and i just enjoyed everything the desert had to offer and it was just pleasant, i felt free from all this, these cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be outside, in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time, it felt good, i'm very proud that i've always been different., that despite how many people have told me that i'm really weird or i'm weird or i think strange things, i have always maintained my original mentality",7
400,"yeah, that's good., i'm fine., around pacific grove california, around <sigh> the wholesale opportunities and uh all shops and, anything i could ever ask, <laughter> the uh traffic the mood of people and the, the unhealthy pace, to see uh, i like culinary and then i did really good in art and music, in high school, by my own will and desire to want, uh interfering with the music, uh no, uh open a uh health practice of any kind, to change things in my life that have an impact on, me and others for the sake of health, when i have the opportunity, to <sigh>, buying things that see the culture, relaxing not thinking about the city, ah well i went to texas every year uh with my father during the summer and i always wanted to stay there and live there when i went on vacation, probably one of those trips to texas, where we spend time in the desert shooting guns and karts and stuff., <laughter> it was, let's see.., my father and i are uh, are not really talking so much and uh my mom died about two months ago, thank you., definitely shyer i've always been so, uh.., just the personality i've grown into, but, learn how to adapt to and grow out of sensibility, oh, tea and.., you know, i like to eat, i mean, it calms me down., um, um.., not so good when i'm really upset it's usually a problem and i have to work to calm down and sometimes i just, don't, deal with something and i won't stop., sometimes but i have learned to control it to this extent now, <laughter> yesterday, i was arguing about what kind of water we should drink., uh good a difference of opinion and i felt as if my opinion was very valid, um, although the opinion of the other party was something, misinformed, every day is a growing process, i wish i had treated everything differently every day., to make me grow and i, trying to work how i wanted to deal with things every day, gradually, to <sigh>, i can't imagine anyone right now., to <sigh>, i'd say, uh, no., support my friends so much with their, choice of occupation, i'd rather not come in <laughter>, therapy uh experts, were really inspiring in the last two months, well, they think that, the essence of all diet comes from raw fruits and vegetables and, this is true with many studies such as t colin campbell the china study and, um, the sources of information that uh are very good and i think that deserve respect based on, you know real research <laughter>, really easy, i almost got it to a science, i'm tired., consciousness, better than i have in a long time, yes, i think it's because of the change in diet and, in no way with a placebo effect that it actually know you, relaxation of toxins and things that have accumulated over, my short lifetime of, um, you know toxic choices with food and, drugs or whatever it would be, <deep breath> yes around less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and, more control over my, decisions and my wishes against what i need, something like this kind of thing, yes, yes to a certain degree, over five years ago, <sigh> lack of motivation and, basically, my symptoms were, parallel to depression, uh loss of appetite loss of motivation do not want to do anything, do not want to have any social fear at all, of uh social situations, and uh, the most important four or five, no, i think i've overcome a chapter in my life that was the doctor., um, you know, control of my health and, experimenting with drugs and i just took another route that was alternative and i started, more juicing and to just try to hear, maybe what i needed with the help of uh, internet and nutrition experts and such things, yes, uh i think therapy is useful because, without looking inward or having someone to help you with it, it is very difficult to respond to some of these problems that you may have that, will only uh resonate in the subconscious until you know it has an outbreak it basically, treatment, will help in general health and mental health, health i think, for all, last night.., i have a really great vegan uh, dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and, had passed a few of my friends and they really liked it very much and i almost converted them <laughter>, yeah, that's good., i'd say , you know i'm trying to listen to my inner consciousness more than what my brain wants me to do., how my brain likes caffeine and sugar, while you know that my body needs something other than this , is an example, it's very difficult, it's a daily process, um, i was.., dealing with money for uh a business partner and, they ended briefly and i was to blame, but it was actually my formulas of, crunching the numbers that made it short, but they he was not aware of the change that i made to the formula so, the fault was on me that i might have taken money and i automatically felt bad about it because of my, restless uh my uncertainty about changing the formula, um, no, twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to, to start eating, raw fruits and vegetables every day, as calm and, um, sadly perhaps cleverly talented, um, i really enjoyed going to uh wholesale food market in downtown engels, around <sigh> a lot of food, uh great prices you can, eat and feed an entire family for a third of the price as going to a normal supermarket, so uh i really get into a lot of fun uh teaching people, how to maybe better eat yourself especially wise and what they eat, food and.., watch a really good t v show, um, i'm insightful, i can uh, i can adapt to people., uh <sigh> i dunno i guess i'm going to skip this question for now, i'm very proud of being around <sigh>, i would say that my general situation in which i am at the moment, i could never have imagined that i would be in such a happy situation.",7
401,"yeah, i'm fine., i'm good, i'm a little tired, but i'm good, michigan, i'm from mirigan, um, a long time ago, then i left, uh, once twice a year, cold <laughter> very cold, because i wanted to pursue my acting career, uh, all right., it wasn't a hard decision, it was just the weather, it was the opportunity, it were the options, more options, uh driving was a pain in the butt not so easy, <sigh> let's see, except for the weather, i like that., things are more comfortable, i like some of the people here., <laughter> who are actually from home, but.., yeah, i like that it's a little relaxed., that's it., i don't like traffic, i don't like it., uh the gang violence, in certain areas and i don't like, what else do i don't like?, what are you doing?, maybe that's all i don't like, i don't know oh you know i like i don't like it so far away from home i wish, i wish i were, i wish it wasn't so far from home, i have a close relationship with my family, um, it's a small uh immediate family is really small, and we've passed near my grandmother recently, so it's around < tisk> an adjustment now, but i'm close to my family, well, i can't see your shoes, but i travel a lot, i'm travelling, yeah, i like to get there as soon as i'm where i'm going, i really like to do the tourist thing, get to know places and, people, uh okay i oh i went around france a few years ago well many years and a small town called catalonne and was very much around, it was actually really fun, but very much like a story book so far what i expected to see and what i actually saw, like me, what i remember that i was really enjoying that at night when everyone close, as there are no windows in the buildings, but, they are these shutters that most places in the united states have inside windows they have them outside the windows and there is no glass so they just closed and it looks like everything is leaving as if the buildings are leaving pretty cool < sniff> i like that, i'm at the border, sometimes i'm shy sometimes i'm going away it depends on who and what the situation is, to music i turn on music i go, through the neighborhoods you know, i'm pretty good at controlling my temperament, i'm not, hot head at all, hm, oh, it was an ex roommate, and it was about my loyalty as a friend, yeah, pretty much she.., thought that because i wanted my rent, which it has agreed to pay, the, i had not taken, to be a good friend, that i should just let her live for nothing and, that would not happen, so you know it, loyalty came with you anyway to let stay or let her stay anyway, even if she didn't pay me, so this is a friend., i could have thrown her out., she went at the agreed time after she told me she wouldn't pay, but, you know, if i had.., there could have been a bad situation, but there was an argument., a real real, i wish i had treated this situation differently and followed my first mind as, we agreed to be temporary roommates, and, to get my money in advance, that's what i wish i had done and i just didn't have my mind told me to join in, no, my mind told me to get the money in advance., but i didn't do it., so, mm, the toughest decision, um, i think i still have the toughest decision to make, but as far as, <tisk<> maybe to leave home, when i was 18 years ago,, yeah, that's good., um, i felt like i was leaving my family, <laughter> that's what i felt <laughter> but they encouraged me to go further and live my life, mhm, uh, something i could erase from my memory, likely, a friend, who, i was.., i'm going out with you., i'd like to erase from my memory how he reacted to me when i told him that my grandmother was sick., it's easy when i'm busy all day and i'm really tired, but actually my mind is spinning like this., it's not that easy, it's not that easy, i'd have to, 'cause i have to, be exhausted, i must be exhausted, exhaust, no, it's not really hard to do just a lot of things all day long, irritable, up and down, up and down and down as sometimes i have, were excited and anxious and on the other hand i'm like, mm, what am i doing?, yeah, it's just scared to let a few things happen., some objectives, and, uh, to get a certain kind of work, and, with a certain amount of, income, and uh, i'm just taking care of myself, you know how i think i should, take care of myself, just the physical stuff., eating properly and everything, yeah, that's good., i've been, sometimes i have a lot, distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what i have to concentrate on right now, and i'm aware that i'm like all the things that pop up in my head, why do i think about it?, i let them happen and then i try to think about other things and, phase it out it reappears on i phase it out, yeah, that's good., no, no, uh, when the roommate went out,, i was really happy when she finally left, ahem, probably reading, and maybe go dance, which would be ideal, i can go dance salsa dance, and yes, mm, my ability to make a decision faster, and to act on it, really bad, uh, i don't know if i have a time someone has ever made me really bad, i don't know., feel bad about, much, uh, as brave, that would be it at a glance, in general, um, i do not regret making some different decisions when i was younger, as far as, progress with as far as career stuff and, relationship things i wish i had done some things, earlier in my life that i do now, uh really after a few of my personal goals and, um, decision to actually be in a relationship that is long term and, yeah, i wish i'd done that sooner, twenty years ago i would have, gave advice to himself,, um, next, with my training, beyond what i have done, and, to be more discernment in my choices of individuals that i allow in my life, um, to be a part of the family i am a part of, thank you., goodbye.",9
402,"yes, all right., atlanta georgia, about two thousand and six, never, i don't like it there <laughter>, oh, it's totally boring and there's very little to do, i a is preferable, i think to most places, uh because uh i was engaged to my fianc e and we lived in florida, i moved there to be with him and, he loves the water, but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i loved florida not, and he wasn't connected, so we decided to go somewhere where we could both be happy, and also have more opportunities in the economy and, all the great things it has to offer, very light, there's not much i don't like about l a, i love it, i think it feels magical, uh so many creative different people, of all age groups, around shapes sizes colors breeds, um, the mountains the water, uh, the city all the things to do, all the people there is to meet i just, i love everything about l a, no, uh, i'd rather not talk about it., i didn't go to college., i'm still finding out., um, i don't know that it may have something to do with animals, i have a dog i really love and i never had a dog, um as an adult i had cats and uh, i think i'm a late flower, so i'm working on this whole conversation i'm not doing., i really don't want a job, i want a targeted way to create wealth, not just something to make money in the long run, it depends on the situation, but in general i think i'm more shy, although most people would consider me as starting., mm, set to classical music <laughter>, music classical music, when i especially stressed <ex> and, to play with my dog, go for a walk., i think i can really control my temper., for the most part, before i came here <laughter>, um, it was just about.., financial stress, uh, um, there are probably a lot of examples, i think i'd rather move on to another question, yeah, i'd rather not talk about it, either <laughter>, i'd rather not talk about it., not very easy at all, um, it's been a lot better lately, but.., i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so, it's a challenge., not to feel rested most of the time, last week i felt much better, yeah, i know., the weather has changed spring has jumped it's a little warmer i had, for more trouble with my depression in winter and around, difficulties with tolerating cold, and so i don't have a lot of things i usually do, and i was also sick with the flu, um, and last week, i decided, um.., that i felt better enough, that somehow i had to get out of my rod and start to, more and more focused on things i have to do during the day and my dog every day on foot and around, do not isolate so much, and see some of my friends more, so i saw, i feel much better than i've made progress and.., last week things have taken a more positive turn, no, yes, uh, it's been official for quite a long time, it's probably already, i don't know exactly, but let's see, maybe more than fifteen years ago, i felt suicidal., no, because i've found a better alternative, i've been in therapy since i was 18., and i've tried a variety of methods, and then i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer, and that was really the first person who, to have helped me, uh make permanent changes and i was able to get my antidepressants as well, and even though with some fights of, depression has never been anything, extremely heavy and around it was, one of the best things that ever happened, i was physically ill., with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client who referred me to that person, because he had healed them from this disease, and, um, that was.., treats several expenditures and so, everything is connected to each other, so to, once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me, i was so happy, i felt like i was something.., i felt that, i found the answer i was looking for that i hadn't given up hope and uh, that.., <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i, i had suffered for a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally, found, the answer to the, the solution i was looking for was like, it was the best thing i've ever done in my life, it was the best decision i've ever made., i felt, extremely hopeful for the first time in a long time, i went to my place., i was at a music store., because i had thought about it, i recorded an instrument that i played., the violin as a child and uh, i wanted to do something., that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it was extremely suppressed, and, and so i went to the music shop to try out, to see what it feels like, um, to handle the instrument again, nan, and see if i thought that was something i wanted to pursue, it was fantastic <laughter>, mm, yeah, i'd rather not talk about it <laughter>, um, all right., there's probably a lot, but.., i'm always working on being more optimistic., it's difficult, it takes time, but.., yes, i wish i could hear my own, internal voice better, <laughter> yeah i'm sure i regret yeah, um, appreciate me more so that i would make better, relationship decisions, uh, my fianc e is the most positive, person in my life, my ultimate supporter, he's i think very unique not uh, not at all selfish and uh, probably giving a little for his own good, but.., always has my best interests in the heart has the highest morale of everyone i know, would give someone the shirt from his back, um is a genius, in so many ways and uh, um, i think i'm lucky., the, i'm not a quitter., that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i did not, abandoned on, take risks and, um",11
403,"yes, i'm doing really well., i'm from granada hill california it's around the san fernando valley a part of los angeles, i love the weather i like the variety in people i like how to go to a neighborhood and it's just not just a race or, type of food i love the beaches, all the activities you could go to do theme parks, aquarium stuff like these museums, the smog, um, there are a lot of creepy guys <laughter>, i've travelled pretty much l a i was across the country and back three times twice when i was seventeen, i like meeting new people and trying out different foods and seeing how other people live, when i was seventeen, i ran away with my friend to take new york to watertown., like a naval army type of city, we had an apartment there it has snowed a lot, we sold antiques for a living, to get passports press passports for the sunset strip music festival by a friend, and meet rock stars and hang out like the private parties, i am very extraordinary i love people, i go to the gym and learn a little, i think it helps relieve stress and, keeps my energy level going i realized <rea> noticed when i wasn't a few days i feel a little tired than normal and, it just helps me feel good, i'm pretty good at i'm very quiet around i worked a lot of events and, jobs where you have to talk to thousands of people a day and people, and you have to stay calm and, you know they're the customers, so you need to make them feel wanted and, good and realize that you are being paid because the money they spend is so, i'm good at solving <reso> like consumer conflicts and things on the job, i had a drunk friend who just, falling around screaming and saying rude things to people and i somehowa, she started to get loud, like she was just telling her to stop, and that she was intimidating, and what she said to people was very mean that you knew., and i wonder if you're talking to people like that., they may not like it and they might attack you or something you know you never know it's l a., i really don't feel guilty about any decisions i made in my life., think i've made really good decisions and i always stick to my moral compass, what i do, i grew up in church so, i haven't left in years, but i still have these values and, you know the rules of the ten commandments and things in my head, i had a slum lord landlord and.., i wish i'd called you to know the right authorities and, he's been through a court trial instead of chasing him out like me because it wasn't after the code., i, a few years ago, i was with a guy, and he wanted me to move back where he came from., and after a few months you know that he came to l a and went home, decided to move there and i had just started, you know that this business i did was going to pick up event planning and i decided to leave there, and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work, but, it was hard to decide how i should leave l a and do this, jump and follow something new and experience something new or stay in what i did, i was i had a degree in dental assistance i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i studied communication, such as radio and television broadcasting and journalism, i do event work and wrote for a magazine for a few years and i try to like it., get a site going and then have how where i write my own and what's going on instead, you know you write for someone else, i always wanted to write and was always growing up in the news and music and art i really like connie chung, she was like a channel four newscasters in the eighties and i love barbara walters, i was a nerd, not a laugh., my sister doesn't talk to the family., and i have a good relationship with my mother, i never knew my father didn't mind me., i have cousins and stuff, but everyone is scattered across the country so i don't really talk to them on the phone we only communicate on facebook or like twitter, oh, i'm going to sleep right, when i get tired, i just go to sleep, pretty well energetic i have motivated to go for more event work you know event planning things and look for, really grinding in more than i was, i mean, it's kind of hard because you have to talk to people and get them to trust you and, see that you plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event as someone else, no, no, i mean, i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens to someone getting cancer or someone i know dies, i wouldn't say that i just, super like oh my god happy all the time, but it's like a straight, kiel that i feel pretty good all the time, i am very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to them quietly and, i could adapt to different situations and even if i'm not my scene, or situation or group of people i'm used to that i could still jump into, talk to people and feel comfortable and find friends and adapt, i want to make more money <laughter>, i remember as in the second grade that these people made fun of me because i was very tall and thin and i was like, just a's one of the highest grades in the class so, people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or, such things, very talkative she would just say that i'm talking to everyone, and that i'm very friendly and if you need help, i'm helping someone you know, oh recently i went to the ocean and visited a friend i've known for years and, we just went to the burger and hung on the beach and, we got her two year old son and took him to the park and played and, it was really nice and it was cool to visit her, i hadn't seen her in six months and, it was really funny and i want to go back and, i like the area, mhm, i, maybe i could try to find my own work more like for my business, instead of working for other people, i think i'm following it, but i think maybe i could put a little more time in it a day, i don't really know anything like, that i want to delete or don't happen, no, i feel good about my decisions i've made and i think i'm on the right track and, a lot of things i wanted to do, then balls roll and i'll always <g> you know i'll do things i'm not as big as i want to be, but i feel like i'm on my way there, as i did ten years ago, i would have told myself to work more a day instead of as much as i was., my friend, whom we call mojo, um mojo has a magazine and i have just written years and, he really urges me to like to continue writing and continue to hold events and keep on the ball i roll and, he's one of the biggest people you know in my life and tells me you're talented., you could do it you know he's just a real, good as motivation for me, you know i was on t v shows and started my own event thing., i have a lot of people who read what i write every day and follow on i just think it's a you know it's not exactly where i want to be, but it's a great start, and i worked to get to this point, thank you.",0
404,"yes, doing good, new york city, all right., originally i was born here, but uh, he spent some time in the east and moved back here and.., basically raised here so, have been here for a while and i enjoy it, there's great weather and.., uh amusement parks a lot of landscape a lot of people, lots of energy and excitement, there are so many things you can really like about l a., see uh a lot of congestion and pollution, i'm trying, but no, i'm not., uh, it's nice to be on the open road with uh, mm potentially <potelingly> time to think about my own life, shy, sometimes it's hard for me to express my own thoughts, well, you mentioned a fish tank and uh, i see spent some time in a, many waiting rooms where there were fish tanks and uh, uh so staring at fish tanks could be one of them, uh but i also enjoy walking or, uh lifting weight reading go in movies just to say a few things, uh, good., moderate.. good.., under control, argued about today's okay last argument was today, just before i got here, and it was, about, with over, how do i say this about driving to a bus stop over uh, how uh make an agreement, feel guilty about, don't take better care of my pet, sure i like birds, so one of my pets was a bird, uh from recently, and, i, let my bird out into the wilderness, and, i wish i had planned it better., um, future for the bird, just because i want the bird now., was closer to me, hm, i'd say, i'm having a fight with people close to me, and, sometimes i don't do well with them., i'm more, reactive, so i'd like to see how this improves., uh no, at least you don't know about any legal difficulties, but.., i think you know it's kind of, not as i would have liked to have treated., guess the toughest decision was just before, of, how to, continue with, further development, a, employment opportunities, i had to, decide whether or not to , if i would, suffer more emotional pain by leaving, my family and whether the financial gain and, knowledge, this experience would outweigh the benefits, yes i am, well, it's a small family, but.., have a mother and a, uh sister and a brother, and two younger nieces, older they are adult adults, it's a good relationship., and, uh, things could be better, sometimes it's a kind of difficult pain., scatching, uh relationship sometimes, there are a few days when i, i need time for myself and i, would rather give the time to, other people instead of taking time for me what my experience was, uh, and so on., this has caused me very emotional, pain uh a little spiritual, uh fear for my future if i keep doing something like this, wow there are so many things <laughter> what about you i know nothing about you, i'd say there's some.., but of the most recent, all right., things are going pretty well, i'm, can't really say that there's something else i can really change or regret that i can remember, it was pretty good., and uh, i'd say it's okay., i'll take good care of my sleep., when i don't sleep well sometimes i can be irritable around, sometimes it's okay uh, and uh would say if, there are also times when i am, unhappy, so, i'm trying to, getting as much sleep as i need, yes, i, i think i was uh nineteen, and uh, i'm glad i did., yeah, yeah, that's good., somehow, but yes., no, um, uh, um, uh.., i suppose it made me a more confident person and more, um, in accordance with uh,

and around, try to fish in, i felt free or alive to be happy, around uninhibited, uh strong confident uh mature, after the military, uh after the military, took some time to get my, my thoughts and uh, my future and around, i have only taken the necessary steps to make progress., it's kind of hard, it's, um, it wasn't easy., a lot of family uh help and around and community, and uh, so it needed some adjustment, but it wasn't easy, uh no, no, you know., this week, partially today, happy., uh happy kind often not too happy, but, contents, happy, happy, i don't know, uh not usually too happy, try to stay, on the centre line, make a weekend, um, get up early, to get out enjoy the day around, along with a few friends, and uh, a little socializing, and uh, maybe you get a kind of uh, consider a form of artistic expression, there may be one like a museum or uh staring at some art or, uh maybe something in the local community, maybe street art, and uh, or maybe something with music or, uh, something of this nature, i wish i could change a few things about myself., make, more decisive in decision making, and uh something else uh, that i, had the same ability for a crack for, uh meet for more people, i suppose, as best friends i don't know about, nice friendly, uh, trustworthy sociable, uh, the same advice i would give myself today <laughter>, something wow, uh, i really enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and her two children, and that was yesterday, and i'm glad i did it, that it was a good time for everyone, i'm proud that i went to the military and.., i'm glad it was a good experience, see you, thank you.",0
405,"hello., yes, all right., not, too bad., i'm from chicago., south side, around back in nineteen seventy eight, when i was eighteen, yes <y>, lately, not much maybe every two or three years, it's different, you know., terrible weather and uh, yeah, it's just a completely different atmosphere., um, let's see, my mother had moved to africa., i graduated from high school, and i had a friend out here, so i just thought good let me try l a, uh very simple actually yes i loved it from the moment i got off the plane, yeah, that's good., number one the weather, sun is very important to me, so i love the weather, i don't know what a more relaxed atmosphere is., variety, from humans, and now it's my.., my home base you know, my, friends, the family are, so it's kind of like my family's here now., hmm, i guess the smog earthquakes, um, transport, simple basic things like this really, um, i don't know right now, but i've been traveling all my life, quite a lot, i just wanted to see., see, other crops and, see for more history and, meeting with people and, just fun and the fun of it also, to see a journey, i went to, england, ireland and scotland and france all in, you know, a journey, so that was a nice variety, um, i guess you could say, probably skiing, in val d'isere france, that was fun., i'm glad i have to do this., i'm shy by nature, i tried to grow out of shy so, i'm not quite shy, but i've always been an extremely shy, child, but now here in the bold city this is my, environment and i guess you could say i'm not really shy in, in my hometown of the culver city, hm, to relax i like to just lure myself into my bed and take a nap reading my book, clock t v, sometimes on the couch in the living room, only you know to stay at home and, a little vegetative, ah pretty good yeah my temperament is pretty level, hm, probably with my, husband, and, i can't remember what it was about right now., well, if you say my family, you mean, my family from childhood or my current family, okay well i think my current family comes to mind, i have two daughters, and, my relationship is pretty good, it's okay with them, but they're teenagers who uh, you know, go through a lot of hormones and, um, they can be kind of bitchy <laughter> and, and i was hoping that you know they're growing up and soon, one day, we're gonna have a really good relationship., and then there's the husband, the, i think i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon <laughter>, we have to get a divorce, but we're still together., for financial reasons, and yes, yeah, so that's not good., the relationship with the man, but.., but since we have decided that we must get divorced, we expect nothing from each other, so we don't argue so much, so that's good, hm, all right., i guess.., our marriage, i wish i'd noticed early on that, you know, it was like getting away from what i thought it was., let's see, o my god, the most difficult decision, i guess leaving my first husband who was pretty hard, well, you know, we were married and i wasn't, content i think you could say, ahem and, i'm just.., gave up our relationship and, i think that now that i look back, it's because, i wanted to, children and he would have been happy to have none, and so uh since i didn't have a father, it was very important, that i, making children with someone who really wanted to be a father, and so i was kind of, at an age when i had to start thinking about it, with children, nor was i with someone who really wasn't in it, so that, i think that's a uh maybe the main reason why i wasn't satisfied and i just, felt like, this marriage won't work., so you know that we went to therapy and everything and he didn't want to break up and, , <tisk> and i had to leave him, because i was just not happy and that was very hard because, you know, i felt like i was hurting him what i was, you know, and he survived that he survived, now he's married to two children <laughter>, <laughter> but around, it was, hard, to leave him, mm, something i wish i could erase from my memory, i have to think about it., i'm sure there's a little bit of asp> oh good, yeah, there's.., i guess it would be nice to delete, from my memory to a new i don't mean new, but an event, in my, recently adult age here in the culver city, where one of my best friends, um, i betrayed myself., years ago, when my husband was first in real estate, she and her family grew and they really needed a bigger home, and, um, we just assumed that you knew they'd use it., my husband as their agent both to sell their current home electricity at the time, and buy a new home, <tisk> and how it turned out, they have surprised us and, had spoken to this other local agent, and yes., that was devastating., i don't think i've ever been betrayed., it's like the, so i wish i could erase this now, because now you know that was back when the kids were really young., and, my daughter at the time when my youngest daughter was, let's say, six maybe, um, maybe five, whatever you're doing,, she and my best friend, daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other, we were pregnant together, and, they were really tight these two little girls and they didn't end up in the same primary school so they didn't hang out during these years, but every time we run them in the neighborhood or they, to meet in a summer camp or something that they were just so connected, you know like two peas in a pod, though it is., her mothers stopped talking to each other., so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together, and they are still very connected in fact <laughter>, for the first time she spent the night in our house last night with my daughter, and another girl, and it's just a little embarrassing because you know it now., these girls are, always really good friends better friends, um, and yet, i still have that., vibrant, um, bad memory, of what they, her mom closed up, for me, that was about what, ten, about eight years ago, in any case,, i tried, i tried,, ignore it and push it out of my head and, which i was able to do <sniff>, over the last few years, but obviously it's still coming, anyway, that was that, it's not that simple., i get a decent sleep sometimes, but, sometimes it's hard to sleep and most of the time i wake up, and can't sleep again, or i'll finally sleep again and then it's almost time to get up, you know that, this difficult thing, well, waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by going to the toilet <laughter>, and then, you know, it's not always that easy to sleep again and then i wake up to go to the toilet., so i guess that's the trigger, until sleep a hard time there, i don't know i think too much., run through my mind and the day, i feel like i haven't reached enough during the day so, it's hard for me to just go to sleep if i'm supposed to, i guess.., um, well, i'm kind of used to it now, so i just keep going., probably looking through the day <laughter> looking tired and around, i'm used to being tired, i just do what i have to do., and sometimes when i'm able to when i'm home and don't have, huge commitments yeah i could just take a nap or something like i said before, read my book watch t v watch whatever, lately, how did i feel about, type from bottom, on myself down to life, well, i still have this outstanding, necessity <n> necessity for separation slashed divorce, um, i'm worried that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls, now they're teenagers., you know on the edge of adulthood, and so i'm worried that, you know, i've done all kinds of things wrong., with her leadership and her early childhood and < clears throat> now it's too late, um, as if i'd missed a thing < th> a lot of things, uh, and yes, i need a job, i'm unemployed, i don't know what i want to do with my life., i know i want to do something, i just wish.., you know, i never finished college, unfortunately, because i was on my way and so, so i'm sorry that extreme, and i have to get a job and take care of myself because i, divorce and move on with my life, so, now i forget what the original question was, but <laughter>, um, this is the state., part of the state of my life, no, yes, mm < tisk>, all right., for the first time or recently, the first time i think was, you know, when i was in my early twenties, i was just a little bit, angry about <laughter> by chance, that was another breakup i had to do back then, i was.., <tisk> in my early twenties and i had to break up with my boyfriend, but again it was very disturbing because i, it was hard because he didn't want to break up and i felt like i was hurting him., and i didn't understand that feeling, i was really excited., as i did not, my first time was with depression, so i didn't really do it, recognize it as depression, but i went somehow i, references , knowledge or knowledge, i was able to, take me to a psychiatrist, i remember paying her by the hour., and she prescribed xanax to just help me relax, and so i guess that helped me through this and then i have depression over the years just you know small parts here and there for various reasons like, i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter>, um, yeah, so the last time i was diagnosed, and take medication, that was probably around, two years ago, no, i don't have insurance., otherwise yes, i would like, for therapy <laughter>, anything that could help, oh,, boy, the last time i felt really happy, um, i don't know, i guess maybe, when my children were born, this is, um, i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just know you know, i always wanted kids, so it was nice, to have them, this is, i don't know, that's all i can remember that i don't think i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times, mm, something i did that i really enjoyed, all right., let's see if i.., friday night i went to a friend's house, and met with, five other girlfriends and we, we created vision boards, and spoke and, had dinner, at one of their houses, that was the fun, yeah, that's good., we arrive, ooh <sigh>, stay in college get my degree, um, get therapy try to become a happy, um, yeah trying to figure things out earlier in life, for example , yeah, that's good., stay in college and oh and especially i think that the main you know what it all cooks < laughter> no matter what you feel depressed about it like, as the proverb says and the songs <s> the, songs you know, it's all about money the world is about money and, with none, that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so next to relationships and various things that have happened in your life, without money, is, you know, it's like you can't even try to fix something because you don't have the money to fix it., so, in this sense, i would definitely advise myself to get my college degree, and to stay <s> to get a job and stick to it, um, don't stop., to go travel you know,, easy with a job stick with a company build your, age of service you retain your benefits, and build up some knowledge or knowledge in some kind of field, yes, it would have been., my greatest advice for me, not much <laughter>, i guess.., only my daughters you know, beautiful daughters and, i am proud and glad that i was able to have children some people, are not even able to do that you know, and they try so hard, or they look back at their lives and they wish they had done so, this is the one thing i mean, i wanted, five kids and i always wanted a boy i never had, but, i'm, i guess that's the, the biggest thing i can do, remember to be proud, has my two daughters, um, i am a very loyal, friend and person, that's why, when this friend betrayed me, it was so devastating, yes, very loyal., very, <inhale> happy <hap> i mean, what i'd say i'd say happy happy <l> going lucky i don't know where that came from, i'm very much i wanted to say friendly, and, maintenance and, yes, i care about people., and i'm interested in people, and, i'll take care of it., also animals, i'm proud to be a vegetarian., yeah so my daughters and be vegetarian, i'm a vegetarian because it's important to me., feelings of other beings not only humans, but also animals and, i don't think animals should be tortured., and a hard life,, just so we can eat them., so, um.., what was the question?, remember the question, all right., you're welcome., see you.",17
406,"yes, i'm doing good., i'm originally from southern california, i like the downtown theater district i like the beaches i like the variety of things you can do in a day, hmm, good sometimes i don't like traffic, i don't think there's really too much i don't like., no, i didn't really travel in about five years., oh, i was just not able to travel around, i just didn't travel <laughter>, i like to go to new places and see things i've never seen before and if i like to visit., places like landmarks, well, the last thing i did was san francisco, that wasn't ready, but i had to stay in downtown san francisco and i had to go shopping., and i had to get on one to get the road car so that was cool, , well, i'm still studying, i'm studying psychology, mhm, hmm, good <sigh>, i decided to go back to school, just pretty fast, so i went to junior college, and then, when it came close to graduation, i knew that i wanted to transfer so, i had taken some psychology classes and i decided i liked it, so i decided to do my major, and it, i thought it didn't have much math but it had, enough math <laughter> so, < deep breath> mm <sigh> good now that i'm almost done, i don't know if i'm going to continue in this area., well, what i originally wanted was to get <sigh> into sports psychology, but i'm not, i'm sure that's what i want, either, all right., i could be shy at first, but as soon as you meet me, i'm going out., <sigh> i think i'm either going to sleep eating something really good or watching something on netflix, good only a good movie i like foreign movies a lot about so much, right now i'm in about martial arts movie with subtitles so, i think i'm pretty good, hmm, you know i know., they're not really long arguments i don't know if they're real arguments i know i argued with my friend around <laughter> because he hung up in my face but i don't know why and it was solved pretty quickly so i don't know if it was really so important, wait, i went out without saying, oh okay, hmm, i can't think of one right now., i think, the hardest decision i probably had to make, he moved, from good back to california from oregon, well, i was really young, so i was.., nineteen twenty ish and i was really alone, so that was pretty hard, because obviously i had to support myself, because it was really boring in oregon, so i like the activity here in l a, you know i don't really feel guilty about many things., well, i'm not talking to them so much about my dad my stepmother living in oregon so i'm probably talking to them on the phone at least once or twice a month, and then, when they come here, i want to say, at least once a year sometimes it can be known twice more occasionally, but not too often then i see them, um, that's it, but i'm pretty much the only one out here my brother's also up there, yeah, that's good., hmm, well, i had a lot of positive influences i think about, just normal people i know, maybe someone i've worked with, maybe, my uncle is really a good positive influence, he knows he has a lot of good advice., mm about <bout> life, hmm, you know, i don't really think something so bad happened to me where i just didn't uh, where it bothers me so much that i don't have to think about it, pretty <pret>, well, i can't say quite simply because i work strange schedule and then i go to school, but.., yeah, if i want to sleep, i sleep really well, but as long as i have enough, you know, hours., really really happy and good, yes, no, i'm always happy uh <laughter> god yesterday, i'm always happy when i talk to my friend, or when i go out and do something, i'm just happy, i'm from work, i'm happy because i'm done for the day, i'm just really happy, i'm in the spring break, i'm really happy now., oh i haven't done like any really extreme fun activities unless you're considering going to eat, but the last activity, that i had a lot of fun doing ice skating around downtown in downtown l a in december, no, i don't really have too much regret, i mean, whatever happens and you know it was meant to play like that., hmm, well, um.., i guess i'd say don't worry about those little things., although they really seem big, they're really insignificant and uh, you won't think about it in six months., i think my, best qualities are i'm a happy person i'm a funny person i'm pretty easy to get with i think most people like me, and i'm just a cool person, well, i wish i could study more i wish i would study more, i wish i'd train more., and i wish that was, yeah, i think that's it., hmm, i don't think i want to talk about it., hmm, i don't know, i guess i just care about supporting myself don't go back home i think that's about the best performance there is, thank you., see you.",2
407,"yes, i feel really good because i.., i've been sleeping, all day yesterday almost and i usually do something when it's not work, it's school when it's not school, it's work and then social life and all that, so i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have a school, i only have school on the weekdays, so i actually slept probably like, eighty five percent of the day, so i really feel good, but i'm actually kind of tired and i've got other things going on, but different from that i'm good today, i'm originally from bakersfield., california, really, i moved to l a when i was a child and then, i left here when i was about three or four., and i was moved, i moved back here, in oh seven and i have lived here, since, um, wow since i've been here since oh seven i'm just back maybe <clears thoat>, maybe how, a few times <ti> well i went there for like a summer, as in oh, eight, i think i've been there almost all summer, but i've only been back a few times since i got back., unfortunately,, uh, um, uh, um, uh it's similar to l a, it's not really comparable to l a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i, anyway, i don't know if i forgot anyway, yes, there's nothing really to do, it's really small, it's the valley around, i have everything to do., oceans and it is located by all kinds of around, through many cool places like vegas and uh, san diego and what have you not so <s>, but yes, otherwise i miss my friends and stuff, but i don't miss, like the actual city, i just miss some of the people who, i grew up with, oh, i can't see your shoes, but i don't travel much, actually i was just out, california like six times, i'd love to travel, once i uh, have enough money to do this, um, i originally wanted to be a filmmaker, and that i still want to be a filmmaker and i want to, studying <stu> i was, i took the communication and uh, have also general ed things and around, took classes like video production and around <tisk>, has done a lot uh in terms of to films, and i've learned a lot of things and i still have that knowledge, but i haven't really used it since i've been back, here in l a i did all this in northern california in sacramento, but around and then i switched <trans> to be, um to the business i took some courses in that, but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done, with schooling and always ready to try to get into the field and, become an optician so, but i still want to be a filmmaker, and that's still one of my plans., and i still have to actually play in to poker, a few years ago and i really like, the idea of becoming, a full time filmmaker or full time poker player, but both of these jobs are, extremely hard to earn out and you, must be like the small percent so that we can see if then, hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere, to be an optician, oh, uh,, i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it was like a trade, it's good, it's a private college, but, it just as specific, trains you in.., a field and you just learn that you don't like your g e and, all these other classes as you would normally do for how to, like one around a major or whatever you're going to do, so it trains you specifically to be an optician and jump into the field, i took it just because i really want to be a dentist assistant and since <si>, it sounds like something i might be able to do., it sounds interesting, but then the consultant actually, to get my attention on an optician, so, i'm trying to be an optician now, and it's so interesting, it's fun, it's.., really hard, but it's interesting and it, and it's, and it's fun it's got to be rewarding, um, benefits to the extent that it is worthwhile to be able to help people to see, better and feel comfortable with, glasses or contact lenses, whatever they feel, more comfortable with, cool, i'm definitely leaving, but i can be shy, sometimes like i'm a little shy right now because, they're talking to you and you're in a computer and you're a cartoon, or uh animated or whatever <laughter>, so, cool, but none normally ninety eight percent, to me actually, what it's actually kind of funny and i think maybe, this could go for some of the poker players to, i've never really spoken to a professional poker player, but as far as i want, uh, actually.., playing poker is about, actually something that, helps me forget everything, as far as e.g., things in the past or present, um or future things that come uh as far as i'm really relaxed <rela>, i just couldn't think about anything and just think about poker and it's actually kind of like a therapy, for me, because i don't like it, i guess you could say it's some kind of drug because i don't think about anything as far as stressed or depressed or things that have happened in the past, i focus on poker, so it's actually kind of exhilarating, playing poker is also very stressful, so i guess it's kind of like, catch twenty two or whatever, but uh, yeah so no poker i play like basketball, i like watching movies i like going to the beach actually, one of the things i like to do is go to the beach because it does, i feel good., but i didn't leave., i usually just go to the beach when it's hot not during the, cold season, so it's coming soon, so i'm looking forward to being busy, but uh, i'll try to go to the beach as much as i can <laughter>, i'm really good at controlling my temperament, actually i've just been in like, i'm thirty years old, i've been in six fights, maybe and, all six were launched by the other person., so i've never started a real fight in my whole life when i was a little kid, but, to talk about real things, like when you put it on a, thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every once in a while when there was, a few times maybe in the past, where like i, was not able to control it, but as far as ever to be violent or anything that never happened and never would, but for.., most of the time yeah i didn't like, people do stupid things all the time and i just like to leave it especially like, on the highway and stuff, but uh, oh well i mean i argued a little bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really, little things, i guess maybe we're just, i think we were good for each other, but maybe another life because uh, we just knocked our heads too much., obviously, she's probably my ex girlfriend for a reason like this., about which we have only quarreled, girlfriend friend things, uh, um, i guess my film production <filmm> to, other treatment, there are a lot of things i could have handled differently, but uh, uh maybe when i was really good when i was younger and, i worked for, , production assistant for filmmakers around, where i lived in sacramento, so i did everything i wanted to do about my dreams, and had a lot of my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment, and then i got involved with the wrong guy., group of people i appreciate and, somehow downhill from there and how lost everything like car job apartment, so i just wish maybe i'd never go with, this kind of people, this kind of girls, um, um.., per and per, uh, because i'd clean my throat, probably my life would probably be a lot different now but i think everything happens for a reason, and obviously i think you should also like when things happen good or bad uh, <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again, you.., do not make this mistake or try it not so bad i think so, you know, mm, hardest decision, i guess, i guess, uh, toughest decision, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, would be.., i guess you could say i don't really know., wanted to say that uh, maybe like my ex girlfriend, like i could've liked, stayed with her and i really like still in love with her and uh, would love to be with her and miss her, but i guess the biggest mistake i had to make was how, i know it wasn't like a healthy relationship and, i know if we liked to stay together or if we married or had children who, i don't think it would work in the end anyway, i guess the decision that would be my hardest decision, to really stay away from her and not come back with her, and uh, don't be like that with her, i guess that was a tough really hard decision because.., i could have done it easy, and i guess maybe it would have been me., in this way happier, but stressed and, in order to be irritable or whatever and have to deal with the other way with it i guess with each other our relationship so, it was really hard is still so uh i think that's it, do not choose to be with someone i loved and loved, or whatever it is, cool, oh, what was that?, i beg your pardon., nevad, i do not understand the first part of this question., oh an event, oh an event okay around that i could delete, uh event i could get out of my memory, my ex girlfriend, i wish i'd never met her., my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend, i wish i'd never met her because we were, we were in love together for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard, so, i guess both of them, oh, it's extremely easy that i could fall asleep, somewhere i actually broke a record i almost fell asleep standing, that would have been strange because i think i would have, i don't know that i just got caught., i think i was really <r> i mean i was really tired, but i do a lot of things so it's hard for me not really get so much sleep, as much as i want to like <l>, but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever., as they say, <tisk> uh no, no, lately i'm just tired, but i'm fine i guess, i'm dealing with this separation, but it's only a month a week., but it's actually not i mean i've happened worse things i'm going to happen worse things, had worse things happen so yeah, i guess.., well, i'm a religious person, i'm catholic i believe in god i know that there is a god so around i obviously even dedicated everything from him, people to god, no matter what they are, sometimes they lose faith, so sometimes i lose faith, but it doesn't take that long and i know there's a god i know., that i'm gonna be okay and that everything's gonna be okay, but you know, it's hard to deal with, i don't really know, i just keep going you know, go to school and work, and i just have to keep going, i can't give up, so i can just, try to stay busy and, staying busy helps somehow and how to sleep, a lot helps, but i can't sleep much so, i don't know., uh play poker, play basketball, deals helps me deal with it and how uh, hanging out with my friends sometimes helps me, why, um, uh, um, uh.., i felt really happy on friday because.., i went to san diego for the first time., it wasn't as cool as i thought, but we were like under certain circumstances, as far as my boyfriend had business to worry about and it took a long time so, i would have preferred to be free during this time but i wasn't, but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i had fun and i was, happy to go to san diego for the first time and i want to, had a good time, oh, she's, to <laughter>, a lot of things, but i think i'd say how, be nicer to like, family members you know a couple of family members i wish i had been, other than , acted differently than not that i was like a terrible, but i would have nicer in some cases that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh, i never really wanted to go around and celebrate all the time as i did, like high school and various part times from outside high school i would have only, really focused on re training and so and then, the party would not have gotten any relationships later, so i would have basically told myself to be more., uh have more direction to be focused, i guess uh, stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i don't appreciate that i'm the healthiest but < sniffle> around yeah i just would have done a lot of things differently, but, i don't know if i said that before, but i think it's all happening for a reason., um, so i guess it all happened., now for a reason, so i'm just gonna keep going., uh, <tisk> i guess they would have the few i have, or few i had because i have best friends now a few i think a new, and i've lost a few best friends as far as we just don't like going our own ways, but i guess they'd probably all describe me more than how, to happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy, umm aloud uh, don't be silly., uh intelligent, and uh, i just think in uh in general just like, entertaining to be around, have, i wasn't always the best friend, but i'm trying to tell you my toughest, so that's how it's like, cool, to <sigh>, change me uh, i wish i'd been around, < > i wish i was 15 pounds lighter, um, i wish i didn't have to., uh, how can i say put this uh i feel like, um, i feel like i'm i feel like i'm, i must be like in a relationship with a girl, i feel like i wish i didn't have to be, as if i felt like, that i had to have a girl all the time, and so i could help me focus on how more, and i wish i didn't need it, sexually around, i didn't always think about sex thing to girls all the time as far as, i have to be in a sex, with them like, as far as sex wants to do as much as i do because i feel like, if i have not concentrated or have to, how to be with girls or like in a relationship, well, who i don't know how to say it, but i'm just saying how i exist like guy friends i know, i don't need as much sex as i do and i feel like i need more than i sometimes feel like i wish i didn't need it that much, so i think i'm a little addicted to it., where i could focus on more things than just, i mean, i don't just focus on sex, but i feel like i'm focusing on it if i don't need it or think i need it so much that i could do more things in my life., but, yeah, so i'm trying to work on it., <low breath> <sigh> what i am most proud of, uh, i'm very proud of, <makes sounds with the mouth>, i'm very proud <prou> oh i guess i'm very proud to work for tv stations back in sacramento and on a lot of around, movie sets, because like me, i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then, two years later, a year and a half later, i started taking steps to become a filmmaker and then i worked., work in the economy and as a filmmaker for a real, really.., really.., good to cinematograph a really good to freelance cinematograph, which is based on living in sacramento they have a lot of things, so i'm proud to have had a dream and i went for them and i and actually end up doing things to my dream, which in my dream so, yeah, i guess that's one of my greatest accomplishments, like, over ten years ago but i hope i know, something like that could happen again soon or you know it like this, perfect, goodbye.",3
408,"yes, i am., i'm doing great., i am originally from venezuela, i was two years old, yes, i was., i was only once, i don't have a family there anymore uh my uh siblings living in florida nowadays, wow there are so many things i like about l a i like the weather i like people, overall, i think the weather is very lucky here, transport, uh i've traveled a little, get to know new people and get to know new cultures, i enjoy languages, to travel yourself, i have traveled to italy uh i lived there for seven and a half years and i studied abroad, i have visited a few countries through europe and i had a really good time, probably travel by train along europe and get to know cities in this way, total, i'm doing meditation, um, it is usually a practice that you can become very natural so that my body is able to, um, feeling if i don't feel well and i naturally, breathe and start my meditation process, mm it might be difficult if you do not practice it every day or if you are not able to calm your mind, but when you meditate for a long time it will be a practice like going to the gym or, drink your daily water around you can naturally learn to meditate, i think pretty good, i don't usually argue uh, and i don't remember any example of arguing with someone recently, maybe to be on the highway and take the wrong exit <laughter>, i would probably have made sure that my uh probably g p s or not over confident, toughest decision i ever had to make uh, i think i'm moving back from europe to l a back home <laughter> i miss my friends, it was time to come back, i had made my school and it was time to come home to visit my parents and join my family., i love my family, they are the core of my life, i have a nephew, he's six years old and he's the love of my life., love them all, my teachers uh my parents and definitely my mentors, well, i don't think i have something so bad i want to erase from my memory., i don't think i'm gonna make an apology., guilty of, i don't think i need to feel guilty., but sometimes i feel guilty when i eat a lot of cookies, because that's not good for my health <laughter>, very easy i sleep like a baby as soon as i hit the bed <laughter>, i felt good., no, i felt really happy two months ago, i went to a, friend's birthday she celebrated in a casino from a city away from los angeles, san bernadino and i played with a twenty five cents with quarters and i won like seventy five dollars in the machine, so that was very cool <laughter>, uh, always planning to do something exciting, to very open, mm not that i know of no, oh, always do what you want to do, life is short and always, learn more, i want to lose two more pounds., i was very blessed, i never really felt someone making me feel bad., and i usually interact well with everyone i meet and i am very blessed that everyone is nice to me, i'm a great listener uh, i spend time with my friends and family, uh not quantity necessarily but quality time, and i'm very supportive and i love to hear pretty much and hear sometimes that's all people need, i went to school, i got two degrees., um business management um uh degree and also i have a language degree, i learned languages when i was very little uh had the opportunity to travel, and it was easier for me to continue learning languages, and uh the business part i enjoy interacting with people who create new ideas, uh innovating, so i think that's where my interest in uh business came from mhm, yes, i am., <laughter> my dream job that doesn't have challenges every day, uh one that i could uh, i don't know that i would just come into the office and everyone and everything would be perfect, but, it's not real, so i think having one of the most important things about a job is enjoying these challenges, very proud of me, my services, and i'm also very proud of my family, and my friends, and how they have uh, uh reaches and overcomes their obstacles, to make sure i have a friend of mine who's now in new york state university, she had some challenges to get there and fund her education and now she is, uh not only at school, but she hosts uh some funding for her education through a lot of writing letters and petitions and things she did, to conquer her dream, to be in school, so very proud of her, thank you., goodbye.",0
409,"all right., mm, all right., safe, mm, i'm fine., i'm from uh l a, yeah, that's good., i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment, yeah, that's good., uh, it's pretty much the same year around as well as actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get all four seasons, so it's kind of like a mixed bag, and, i guess i'm kind of used to it by now, so it would be kind of nice to explore other areas., i've lived here all my life because i've made too much travel, so uh, it's a bit of a ruttiness., but overall, it's okay., well, i've taken computer programming into operations, but that goes back to the seventies, so the technology has changed a lot, as one can say <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>, that's why it was my major, yeah., um, i don't know that it's kind of curious that you have to use your mind., it was as if you knew brand new something that you know very new, back in the, in the old times that one knows in the seventies, now it's all for computers, but then it was kind of like < sniff> something very unique around, you didn't see you know too many computers back then., and around i worked in programming so that i somehow put into the logic of it you know compilation together, you know to solve a, a special to know problem you come up with step by step solutions on i think all kind of back then i was somehow more into the, the analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> i can't say this word now <laughter> the analytical properties of the, the problem, mhm, uh, no, i kind of turned off, i'm still using computers, but i haven't got yet, i wasn't in programming for a long time, well, i kind of got into another area, kind of a distraction., uh turnoff <divorcion> to turn off to another area in my life, uh that goes back to the.., the late seventies i somehow took a different turn and then, when i somehow came back into it, it was, i kind of got into another field, so i never really followed it., up to the degree i wanted, wow that's a good question <laughter> i've never thought about it uh, well actually kind of ironic <i> ironic actually something was pretty simple at this time, so maybe that's why i'm a little depressed and then.., at this point i wanted to somehow just do some kind of a beautiful relaxing, job but i want something of a challenge, but i don't want to do too much, too much thinking, that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the old days you know, i just want a nice comfortable relaxing work that i can feel, fulfillment, but i don't want to, too tense of a situation that i am somehow in the place in my life where i just want a nice, relaxing work, yes <laughter>, yeah, that's good., oh, i'd say, good for most shy, but sometimes when i go i could be going out, um, but.., i speak in general, i'm shy to start with and then sometimes i can loosen somehow and be more, singing and sometimes i can take it to the extreme where i talk too much, as once the funny gates open them kind, open up too much, so i have to turn my back on you., but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as a general behavior, oh, really., yes <laughter>, oh, uh,, well, i listen to music around, i'll take a good look around., i'm gonna.., what do i do to relax?, well i just try to avoid stressful situations like somehow i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends, i'll be in an area, all around, type of comfort area where i, i feel safe i can only, dialogue with people so somehow brings me out of my, think of my own, problems i have somehow i just know you focus, about being at the moment with my, well known <acqu> friends and acquaintances, i'm pretty good, i don't really have a temperament problem., it takes a lot to get me to explode uh, i think when i was younger, i was a little bit more, had a little light temperament i never had a really bad temperament but uh, uh temper isn't really a problem i have, i tend to be quite gentle easy to walk, yeah, that's good., wow, that's a good question., um, i'm not sure to be honest., i would have to think about it, to be honest for a long time <laughter>, i can't come up with an answer to that., it's not really part of my repertoire, nothing comes to my mind from above on my head, all right., um, well, the only thing i can imagine and somehow go back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments, back about ten years ago, i was more around, i'm trying to think about what word i'm looking for for more people's trust, how uh people and how uh <tisk> i thought were experts in their field, and, i inherited some money, i was a little careless about it., and i just had a mood that you know.. nothing would go wrong, kind of a little bit of naivety <nait> nativity, and unfortunately i've done something bad, financial decisions that somehow make me into a bad, position for the rest of my life, unfortunately, because of a medical condition i have, it's hard for me to recover and you know, make it all out, so i'd say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions, that i really regret, wow, hmm, that's a tough one., i can't think of anything from my head <laughter>, all right., oh, well, uh, i don't really have too much family left, the only one i have is my.., it's just me and my uncle., and we communicate <c> we communicate regularly around, he lives <li> but he lives in clear water florida, so we're all right., but.., he's like eight, he's in the eighties, and obviously i'm in the fifties, so.., we're doing we kind of have a little conversation he's kind of worried about my well being, but it's kind of flat on a flat level it's not us getting really deep, and he has his own problems., so that we don't really get into too deep a conversation, and different from him it's really there's not really someone else i have, so it probably depressed me a little because i don't really feel, i have someone i can really count on or trust., i don't know why, but i have a medical condition, so i think that might be part of the problem., and, i've been, a little b p a, so i have to get up to go to the toilet., and, to answer your question <laughter> to a, long story short <laughter>, um, it's difficult to sleep a good night i usually wake up uh feeling a little tired, or pain, so it's difficult, uh.., well, i feel okay, i mean.., i felt kind of tempered.., i'm trying to solve problems i don't have., responsibilities assumed for, but.., i feel a little calm as of late, no, well, i said yes when i filled out the questionnaire and, i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with taking a uh, i think it's m m p h, the multifaceted minnesota, personality something of whether or not, that goes back about six months ago, they asked me questions about my memory, but then they also got questions about my, my well being also psychologically and i think some of the, the answers said that they, guess that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist, i didn't follow that., and that's because.., of philosophical differences, but i think i have one you know., a mild case of depression, well, you know.., as i said, i'm just kind of like a way to go in life i'm uh, i'm fine, but i know that i, life is passing, so i haven't really fulfilled my life., my goals, you know, i'm kind of alone, i'd like to have a girlfriend, i don't have a girlfriend, so that's someone i feel like i can get closer., and i'm not really i'm kind of in a transition time in my life now so uh, there's a little uncertainty, i've got some you know, some kind of financial uncertainty, so, um.., you know i'm not as good as i'd like to., wow, that's a good <laughter>, really happy to, let me think about it a minute, well, it wasn't so long ago that i was actually dealing with <makes sound with mouth>, okay, i know you can really come up with an answer, i helped a lady she was at a fair., it was home it was a natural product expo so it was pretty nice we uh, we had some nice meals afterwards there were a lot of exhibitors, give away really nice samples, it was in anaheim, so somehow i got a chance to get away from l a, and, you know some interesting people met who were very extraordinary, they were willing to like, let me experience your products or services, and, i was near people who, i work with whom i have to socialize with so much, i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh, about a month ago, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's it., best friend, i don't know if i really have a best friend, but uh, i'd say.., hmm, i don't technically know that i really don't have a best friend, so it's really hard for me to answer that, so uh, i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>, um, i like to be conscientious, you know, i have mistakes and everyone, but i think, overall,, i'm conscientious i'm trying to be honest for the most part on the most important questions i may know, say little white lies or you know,, i'm not perfect on it, but when it comes to the serious stuff, i tend to be pretty honest and i'm a tough worker i got <g> good work ethics, um, i tend to, pretty quiet for the most part, um, what do i regret?, well you may have that <laughter>, um, um.., i'm just good, just total, i regret uh, a little more persuasive in in my previous, uh previous life uh, and somehow put me in this position, it's kind of due to my financial decisions that were kind of like my albatross in my life., i made some bad decisions and unfortunately, i have to pay the price for now somehow, so i like, something like, living a kind of pauper existence at the moment that is somehow a kind of depressing, so i'd say that's probably what i regret the most, well, i'd say to really know you're somehow going to analyze with what you really feel around, i think, i gave advice to other people with the opinion of other people, i was kind of gone from, my basic, being that you know how i really felt, like for example i would do aggressive, uh invest that, if it turned out it would have been like a way of winning the lottery i would have been, good for the rest of my life <laughter>, but unfortunately it went in the opposite way, too many eggs in this basket, so i kind of regretted going with you, my gut feeling and let other people influence me, and uh, because by nature i'm a conservative person, so i really should make more concervative investments, in other areas of my life i tend to be more conservative, but somehow i did some, aggressive financial decisions, so that's pretty much, somehow it always goes back to this area as far as i regret, yeah, that's good., wow, that's interesting, i did a lot on the weekend, so <laughter>, <laughter> good, i like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i really can, you know, making money, it's kind of like my bread and butter time, 'cause i do fairs., but if i don't, i might like to look at a few., you know i'd like to, go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game, go to the movies., going out with a few friends, so i would just, or you know, just step back a little bit, but my primary primary focus would be on, you know, earn money on the weekends, uh, that's interesting., proud of, um, i would say that i was living a healthy life by and large i would say i have never been in any kind of really, bad, bad uh, motor vehicles, um, you know, i, i lived a pretty healthy, healthy life, i'd say that would probably, i don't know if it's really proud., but as far as i was concerned, the course remained as far as, no really deep <laughter> alley to go down, so to speak, all right., it's my pleasure., goodbye., nan",10
410,"yes, today is my daughter's birthday., california, yes, around the beach, i love the water, the violence of the gangs, violence, i've lost a lot of friends growing up., around through primary school and high school, only to lose them through gang violence, yes, thank you very much., it was pretty hard out there <laughter>, um, hasn't been to any place in california yet, so not really., i'm an optician and a certified optician., and i also have the degree of my employee, uh, actually, i went in., i didn't really know what i was going to do when i first applied, i only knew that i wanted to change my life and do something successful, before i settled down and you know that my daughter and everything, to actually my consultant somehow helped me and i, i always thought they were so cool because their white long lab coats, to be an optometrist, because i'm already an optician and that's like the first step, and what i'm asking why is a good question because, then i would be able to have my own business, and i would have something to leave successfully to my daughter, and she wouldn't really have to want something, it would be like a, a family business, but an a to help the community as well, and something i could leave for my daughter, my daughter is five years old., she's going to primary school next week., and today is her birthday five years ago i had her <laughter> around her is, i taught her at home that i taught her for five years, and.., she's adorable, she's my heart., no, that's like the hardest job ever., it's very hard., provided, provision of uh ensure that , they wash their clothes because i mean it's hard enough., to be a parent, but i'm a young parent and, i'm a little more mature than her father., it's.., it's the deployment part i would basically say to make sure you need everything they need, it's so, complicated, let alone.., it gives you enthusiasm to be more to walk the extra mile around, even being here today would probably have been in bed, but today's my daughter's party., and i've tried whatever extra little money i could make you know to, make sure they have a good day so, it's all about going the extra mile., to do everything you can to provide <pro> for them, but it is a very hard work, um, the moment of the day, when your child tells you how much she cares for you, and, my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and, how many, i mean, just call your name it, it's a sense of reality., to be called mother or to call dad and, it's just like it's in love with you, it also lets you know what this reality is, that's my life, that's what i'm living now, and, it is a very good feeling that is the best part of being a parent, thank you., um, many different things i actually am, take care of my daughter <laughter>, i'm here with her., i was raised by my grandparents., i mean, i didn't really learn that i wasn't my mother until i was sixteen and, my father, i mean, i couldn't point him out., on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is, i can feel it., i'm very different from her, because, no matter how hard the job i always don't give up, yeah, that's good., um, i guess i, there were a lot of different people who were very positive., in my life i can say, my sister had a good influence on me to get into the medical field., she's in the uh she's a l v a, she's one of my older sisters., i can say , i believe in god, being in my life god has to be in my life, also keep my strength and know that i do not have to take over this world alone, because god is there for me and, um, hm, i don't know., i don't really look up to a lot of different people because, people lie like that, and that's the best i could think that was positive for me, i think i'm going out <laughter> i used to be shy, get up as a child, and, i don't know what happened to me., one day i just broke out of my bowl and, i was.., very accurate, shows my personality of <laughter>, um, i really like it, for, to collapse the waves against the rocks on the beach, and i like to just sit there, and all the others who are there, just turn them off, and rub my toes in the sand, and that's so relaxing, um, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, excuse me for apologizing., i've learned not to do it because it's a form of knowing who's in control and it's your life or someone else., and i feel my temper is controlling my temperament, shows that i am responsible for my life, so i don't even let things come to me, i don't even really remember the last time i had to control my temper, because that's how much i'm trying to, negativity, mm probably my husband < yawn>, my daughter's father.., uh probably about how uh you know the dishes or how the little things, but not uh, physical confrontation as with another person no, wow, to be honest,, i feel somehow guilty, about how things like uh basically ended up like things, before my mother died, i wish that, i could have done it., helped her a little more, even if people say i shouldn't feel bad, because she wasn't really there for me when i grew up., but i feel guilty, as you know., not to be there as much as i could have been for her, before she died., i think this is something i still feel guilty for., um, passes through my mother, um, i felt like.., basically, that, it was i felt somehow, robbed in one sense, as i felt that everyone had other parents and, i grew up with my grandparents and then, for me to go so many years without really knowing mom and dad, to be 18 years old for me and then she leaves me, it was kind of like, i don't know it was annoying, because, i felt, you know it was., i didn't have them all these years and then now that i'm older and i don't even have them now, so, um, signing the newspaper with a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter, i was so nervous, so scared., to really not know what to do, how to take it, and i mean, it's so scary, it was the safest way to bring my daughter into this world., yes, it's hard <laughter> i didn't even sleep last night, that's why i'm yawning, but.., i tend to,, try to do everything and i have to get, back to the stage in which, i have to think about myself, too., and give me time, uh, a little like that., but actually i'm a little nicer today <laughter>, um, only groggy, um, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, lately i felt very confident, on the need to make a positive contribution to to the, the extra mile of being a good parent, uh, yeah, i really don't care what other people think., i've always been bothered with it, but not anymore., no, no, um, today, because, i was so happy that i was, my daughter into this world today on her birthday, to meet people, mhm mm at the moment not, when i go, uh to see who i associate with, my weight <laughter>, uh, i'd say my grandma, mm, um, um.., it's just.., i'd rather not., for my daughter, this is my pride and joy, wow, thank you., see you.",12
411,"safe, pretty good, new york, i moved to ia in the seventies., but i did, but i lived a lot of different places, of, um, i guess every few years, but, i travel a lot, so i lived in, i lived in africa, i also lived in spain switzerland hong kong., around different cultures food music rituals, uh, everything that smells the colors, makes you feel alive, excuse me., one of my travels, uh i lived in kenya for about a year around i'd say, i love riding like this when you are, uh other animals see when you are, type of disguised in the scent of a horse you can get the animals much closer so around it was great, see red orange autumn sunsets and, ride along, you know uh, so many animals see yeah, in kenya, probably when i went to a, a masai village and i happened to live in hawaii, and i was on tahiti, and i was wearing one of those pareos, which are handpainted, and i had it, tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to, entering a masai village for the first time, uh that day and i looked around everywhere and the men wore their clothes exactly the same, turn <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came to me and they said why are you masai dressed, and uh <laughter> and around then they came back and gave me what seemed to be, uh, some very large, which looked like pearl leather bookmarks, but they were actually earrings, so they weighed like, my ears straight down and then they gave me some bracelets, and then they uh i had to wear something around my waist and they said now you really see masai <laughter> so but i just i have a lot of uh i think live, get a chance to live in different countries around the world i just got uh you feel alive all your senses are totally you know uh awakened yes, i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of people are a hybrid of both i mean, i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely bold, uh and very brave at other times probably one of my best virtues is that i'm very good natured person, so if i really feel passionate about something, i risk everything to go, sometimes to reach i think that, um, usually i do well i make decisions very quickly, and i think i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he told me how to make decisions faster, and i told him i said well in any case, you always have no choice and he says what you mean there is, hundreds of decisions and i didn't really say, because it's belly wise just one, and it's not really important you waste time physical energy emotional energy, mental energy reflects everything if well wise you always know what the choice is, what you really want to do, and it doesn't matter if there is a ninety eight percent probability of failure, even if it's a two percent chance of success, you have to go to the one that can give you joy, so i always go to the one that it's a waste of total time for me., and energy to even think about another choice, because who cares if you stay unharmed, but it if it does not bring joy, uh, excuse me., you said you'd put your fish, what do i do if i'm angry?, to <sigh>, <tisk> i think if i'm upset sometimes it's me, because sometimes i can have, i can have a little more patience around, i guess you really have to sit down for yourself, in the shoes of another rather than the way you would react, you must have more empathy, i don't think that's why i'm so happy to travel because you, in other situations where you are forced to, to the, understanding other people, lives much more, regardless of how different they are, uh from your different situations i've been in so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that it helps you to create what's why, traveling is really the best education there is, let me think., last time i argued about it, a little, uh.., god, i'm trying to remember <laughter> around, oh, i think it was when someone didn't respect my privacy in something, um, uh.., oh, i know what it was., it was someone who belonged to the uh, uh scientology faith around, i don't know., inherited, i may have inherited an immune disorder from my mother, my mother died of lupus., and, uh i sometimes even at the moment i have rashes and everything and i'm very photosensitive, and, i had a you know an episode where i was i had big torches and i didn't feel really good i felt red and everything and the scientologist tells me that i had to be audited, and, and he said something about are you aware, past lives and, i had told him that i was a buddhist and i was kind of curious that, if you are trying to recruit someone to at least convert to your religion, you should find out the other person which religion they are to be even informed and able to talk to them, and i and he said that you know that, um, <tisk> about something in your past and i'm going to think that, many religions uh including buddhists and scientology believe that things you have have <ha>, had in your story sometimes affect you or things you keep that anger asking bitterness, through your previous relationships or your, parents and such can influence and even make you sick you even have cancer, yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe that i said that, you know that you have the power of each person to go a god like or a buddha like nature and you can make yourself, even if i'm close to being maybe, i'm probably getting a cold., maybe every fifteen years i have no tendency to be sick at all, and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on edge, i'll take, like i did, even when i was a child when i was seven, i would., folding i had my boo boo, and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part, you know, help the bad part <laughter> out of a simplistic way in relation to a child, and i would actually, even when i was in a very serious car accident where i was cut by glass my whole back, i concentrated healing and when i went back to the hospital, the doctors actually had the nurses coming and say this is incredible that, only <jj> she last week her back was cut so hard this is incredibly healing thing, so i think that but uh, um, uh, but i was just, i think, upset and irritated a little, because the scientologist told me that, because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he had these certificates on his wall that he felt that he had more enlightened and, it wasn't even one thing i said if it was him., whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i practised buddhism, whether it was for five ten fifteen, twenty years or if someone has been practicing a kind of christianity for fifty years and is sitting in a church every day, does not mean that this person would have, never visited the church and more spiritually than someone who has, you know, so i just thought this was the antithesis of, someone who says they're enlightened, but it's just the way i think he's getting his, uh, you know his belief in my neck that after a while i was pretty patient with him, but he was so pompous that i was irritated, especially when he kept telling me that it was being audited and that the same person needed a hip surgery, the following week, and i didn't show him because i didn't want to., into it, but, you could say hey you have a bad hip because you need to be tested that something you've done in your past, otherwise you wouldn't need to have a hip surgery i mean, i think to some extent things that can be caused, from the people themselves, and then he says flippy good, you're aware scientologists believe that, past life can also be based on, you know, and i think of myself, buddhists of all religions are, are somehow as well known for you know, believe in a cause and effect and past life situations and i found my thoughts, he should really read when he tries to convert other people < laughter> from other religions so, but.., you know, i know it just wasn't me., you know he cares about the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>, but unlike that, i don't mean, <sigh> um, uh.., sometimes having a little more beat, i guess when, when it is in relation to patience, i can figure this out right away, i guess i'll cut my father off when he was like a vegetable in the hospital., mm < sigh>, mm my brother, uh should be the strong one supposedly because he, is in the medical field so my sister and i said good, you know he's the doctor, so he's probably used to seeing this all the time., but it turned out that he was the weakest and also after, you know my boss, my father,, you know., you know it would make his body crooked., fighting the artificial breathing device and all kinds of things you see, all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was very difficult, but you know it was after a while the uh, you even know the doctors and even the uh pastor of this particular, uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he wouldn't be like any more, even if he'd wake up from that he'd be his brain function, you know, negligible, yeah, it was mhm., hm, mm, i don't think i really have so many things that are so traumatic., that happened to me that i, had to block it i really don't know what, it's in my makeup,, doesn't make me feel like i don't have to hold like i do i have friends who, have unchecked problems they don't even know, who influence their behavior or perhaps their bitterness or anger or hatred or fear, and for some reason i feel blessed that i, i can't even think of something that, i mean, i had something, bad situations happen to me, but, it's not why they traumatized me., influence, you know my behavior where i would, where i block it, that i am not aware, of something or i think rest, negativity for some reason, i can't think of anything i mean., there are bad things that happen and i know they're there, but it's not like i have the feeling that it's necessary for me,, to block them because i was able to, you know., sometimes accept <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that have happened, pretty easy i can usually sleep my own myself in any situation if i could take a one hour flight to san francisco i could only, kind of lean on the window with the pillow have the ceiling over and even on an hour flight out before the plane has even taken out of the ground so, i can just <j>i literally have when i have had little sleep and i have very uh high energy so i don't really need so much sleep, but, like i'm in africa and i'm in africa, <tisk> bumpy pothole unpaved street and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i just requir put up something my, elbows against the window and say, i think i'm going to take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes so and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have this problem, okay pretty okay i mean, i could flare up without the skin, but you know, from the photo sensitivity and all that, but unlike that, i'm in pretty good spirts uhh, have i ever investigated < s> what, i still couldn't hear you, i'm sorry., have i ever studied changes in my behavior, what was the word, yes, um, uh, um, uh.., around <sigh> i don't just know with friends and all this, last week just seeing friends i enjoy being with and just laughing at a great meal just you know a good time listening to music, repent my whole life you mean, or you're just talking about it, or what you're talking about, mm, you know it's funny., uh i find that a lot of negative experiences that have happened in my life, too, have been, uh, um, opened up experiences that, they're also great that i'm not, for example, i was totally torn down by my business partner, after the melody of all my <wh> all my savings and i had to start over and, sometimes people sat with me like, if you're sure you're okay, you're just pretending to be okay, or, if you're angry, if i was, you want to seek revenge, you know, because my business partner basically ripped me off, we knew each other's families that even, more difficult in a way around and uh, he basically stole my whole life savings essentially in a way and he was sent to jail and the f b i involved was interpol involved, i lived in switzerland and my father was sick and i went back and forth and around, but you know, if i hadn't sneaked in, i wouldn't have gotten involved with him., i would not have had the many rich experiences and i sometimes think the reason why, i don't know why i'm such a positive person, but for some reason i'm able, it's not that i'm deliberately trying to see, the positivity in even terrible situations that i would not have gotten, to live in barcelona and i would not have learned to speak spanish so well <g>, german, uh lived in europe if i didn't participate in business with my business partner who ended up tearing me apart, but and there are many other experiences and different friendships that i develop, during this time and in some way it was a completely different life, uh, another world that, that you know that i never, um had the chance, you know,, live through if i don't have my, you know, but of course it cost me money and then again i was always the kind of person who, money is not everything and, i think when i'm least interested in money, when i made the best of it so, there you go., <laughter> and, for example, one of my favorite, times in my life probably when i lived in kenya, and you'd think that, you know a lot of people have that., really bad vision of it maybe look alive, in mud dung huts or something and live very primitive i mean it's not that at all, but me and you would think that with the least amount of, uh technological <tech> technological innovations and things like that i actually mean and i really didn't have, they know that a lot of many material goods at the time i mean, i had the explosion i probably had the one of the best, years of my life when i lived in kenya, the same thing i probably did when i was about fifteen or sixteen, um, to, live your life with passion, and again how to choose the way i said earlier about, making decisions, you must make these decisions wisely, what will, give you a sense of reverence and wonder that would make you happy, and you need it regardless of what the percentages are, even if you have only one percent chance of success, you have to go into this because that's the only thing that will deliver, you know happiness in your life, <tisk> the fact that i stuck to it and was brazen, whatever you want to say, the balls have the chutzpah the cojones to go and, follow my, passions and, you know, and i guess people sometimes call them strong choices, usually, decisions that are simple <ea> if you don't normally give pleasure where you remain unharmed, that's just murphy's law, that's exactly the way it is, safe, see you.",0
412,"yes, all right., originally from texas, oh a few weeks ago, well, i've lived in, uh., palm springs actually so uh l a there is much more to do and uh weather is much better, uh for work, yes, the weather of the beach, a lot of activities things to do, mm transport, and the uh rental is higher <high> much higher here, at first it was a bit difficult, but then i adapted., especially in the united states, uh new experiences uh learn a lot of things, oh yeah, once i went uh yosemite, and up through san francisco, uh i really enjoy the beautiful landscape, uh probably when i, last year i met a friend in san francisco and drove down the highway., saw a lot of uh sights, horst burg things like this, uh computer science, i went to school in the '80s and computers were uh, a new and upcoming thing, so decided to do that, little little not too much, uh, probably.., i think like having a little uh little magazine, uh, well, i've already started it's like a little uh local magazine that has uh coupons and uh, go to extend it to various uh parts of california, probably shy, um, mm good view, not uh, i don't appreciate going out like many of my friends, um, i actually go dancing i like dancing, it's relaxing for me, uh uh i do latin dancing so i did it several times a week so on the last weekend i, very good, i think i was arguing with someone a few weeks ago, it was a religious issue., um, felt good, mm, um, see, i can't think of any at the moment <laughter>, let's see., maybe when i made one of my real estate sales, um, i was.., sometimes the customers are pretty uh pretty difficult, and i think i should have been a little more uh, improvising with them, mm, probably uh moving to california, well, i left my friends and family in texas., and just to start a new life in california out here, it was pretty difficult, but you know i've been adapted., well, um.., i just have an aunt and a couple of cousins, so it's not too much of a relationship, i have a big one, uh, an aunt, this is my mother's sister., and uh, you know, i, send your texts regularly, but most of the time i don't have much contact with the family., um, probably parents, both were very supportive, mm, probably when the parents were ill, and they died, no, well, i both parents were around, got sick and got dementia, and, uh, it's, one parent didn't remember who i was., so it was uh that part was pretty difficult, well, they died, so it's just.. it's been about ten years, so it's just.., now it's just memories., mm not too easy, uh, it's just throwing and turning i think all night and uh probably think too much about thinking things, uh, likely like the future things like the economy and uh, my work things like this, uh tired, tired <laughter>, mm just uh not so positive, no, no, mm, probably uh, a few weeks ago i got a pretty good uh real estate commission, so i was happy about it, when i'm in l a, go to some of the meetings groups or some of the uh, i like to go to whole food and, and try to go some new uh places to dance salsa, no, mm, likely to be more uh out, mm, likely to be more successful in uh business and a little more uh, uh, going out., mm, probably my boss is.. he's pretty condescending., and, really likes to beguile people, and uh, <laughter> sat him down uh as the king, so he said a lot of comments to build himself up and uh belittle whoever else is in the room, it's.., all right., usually when you go in, he likes to brag about how much money he's made in business., and uh, then say things like uh, see how much better i am than you are, they have , look how much money i made this year, and you're the worst fucking agent there is., things like this, mhm, um, probably uh i have integrity and a good heart, working hard, honest, um, likely, i just left, i guess i went dancing., i was at a casino., in a small town called temecula, i've met a lot of new friends and uh, it uh dancing and meeting friends, new friends, um, likely, it was about uh, education i guess my education and uh able to move uh, to move here where i wanted to go, thank you., see you.",12
413,"yes, i'm fine., i'm from greenwich connecticut, yes, i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago, i try to go back at least once a year, sometimes i go more times less, overall i think i like where i'm out better than l a in general, um, i think that, other than being somewhere, i'm familiar with the kind of people that are there, are just more my, guy and what i'm used to and, it's less superficial., i moved here after my high school degree, and my mother and sister live in california., at first it was easy because i felt like, it was a new experience, so you somehow adapt and just, experience everything at once, but then after the first years, when it really, how different it is and, what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally, uh visual art and photography, i was interested in photography since high school around i have a lot of programs and, receive awards and such things and publications, so i decided to pursue art, um, yeah, i got a degree in fine arts that i got last year and, , yeah, i really enjoy working in forensics or intervening., i like this better than at first, what i wanted to do was freelance photography, i feel it's a safe job and it's very interesting, um, that's an interesting question., i think just my childhood in general, growing up, well, my family is very close., um, also my extended family and they all live <li>most of them live, within the area or on the east coast in general so we would always great family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that, yes, it's really fun and we try and all together as much as possible, that's, more difficult now that everyone is distributed among different countries and countries, i think i'm more shy., um, i, seeing reality tv i find it kind of funny and lighthearted, around i look like bravo t v like the real housewives shows and, like funny things you don't really have to pay attention to, um, i'm good, i guess i don't really have a temper when i, when i stressed more it definitely shows up in my attitude it but i didn't really like anger, um, well, me and my friend like bicker <laughter> all the time just like, insignificant things, but different from the, i had a fight with my dad a few days ago., um, there was some kind of tension going on., then i went and visited over the holidays in this last winter, things about his girlfriend and, he thinks i should be the one trying to, have a relationship with her although he does not think for any reason that it should go both ways, so for the thirtieth time that he, we were on the phone and he was, i told myself how to call her and talk to her, and i told him i would do it last weekend because of the jewish holidays and, he was very mature and told me oh forget she doesn't want to hear from you now and somehow like i might be less interested because i, i don't care about having a relationship with her, so if she doesn't want to hear from me, you know it's easier for me., um, i mean, every time when <t> i mean, it was the same recurring argument a lot and i wish,, that i could do sometimes, but i wish that the times it turns into an explosive fight, that i could just bite into my tongue, but the thing is, he says,, certain things that are not true, or things he knows how will tick me, who are really mean, and, that he shouldn't say to me, so, so i kind of lose it and i can't really, mm like nothing to say, um, well, i guess the toughest decision i've made that i don't, i just realized that it's the hardest decision to look back when you decide where you, after graduating from high school where you go to college because for me i basically, changed my whole life and moved away and did all this alone, so it didn't seem so difficult to make a decision at the time it felt like a progress of the next step, but now looking back, this is probably one of the most difficult decisions i've made, um, well, i wish i could erase, the event or the sight, my grandmother's funeral,, obviously, it wouldn't change anything., but, it wasn't, seeing her wasn't something i wanted, how to have in my memory, around her she was a very positive influence and always, was not judging, um, and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they are very successful people, so whether or not we have differences of opinion, that we are separate people, they are good role models in terms of what you want to have if you, are older, usually it's easy to stay the problem aseep, no matter how late i go to bed, whether it's ten p m or four a m, i'll be up like clockwork, at seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to, find out why i can't sleep anymore, no, i'm just.., in the morning i'm probably a lighter sleeper, but i just wake up as if i just couldn't stay asleep anymore, which was never a problem that was so consistent, but now it's, i can't remember the last time i slept the morning after eight thirty., i mean, it's easy when i have to do things during the day, it makes it a lot more strenuous., but it's not really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday life, um, i don't know, i feel kind of very, mm, like that, only, no extreme highs no extreme lows it is somehow, a note country, i mean nothing like lately, um, as recently it is just i would say over a period of years i have a kind of gradually settled more and more, reserved only and, not very outgoing, no, no i was diagnosed with fear, i had a few breathing problems for a day or two and had to go to the hospital., because i thought it was more serious because i couldn't breathe, but, they said it was a physical manifestation of my fear, i think in the right environment and, with the person who does it when they are open minded and the therapist, is helpful, and good in what they do, then yeah, no, i haven't been in therapy since i was a kid., i left because my parents thought it was a good idea to like, to deal with all the problems they had with me, but it was never i mean we just sat around talking about my day, it wasn't, i don't feel like i needed therapy back then, so i didn't really get much of it., well, i was happy when i was home with his family at my friend's house for the new year., when i'm there, i can only, we save our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to, paying worrying about bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow, who i have to deal with every morning, we wake up and hang out., just enjoy the day, in general, um, i regret the college i chose to go, i didn't, from the east coast, the entire collegiate system is very different and, universities are not the same as the tightly knit californian school system out here, so, when i was researching colleges, i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college, just like boston college at home, or, you know every other school called college at the end of that i didn't realize until you knew the end of my first year., that it was more like a transfer school like you, you can't even know you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i left., so it kind of creates more problems for me, well, considering i'm twenty two, i'd probably say ten years ago., i'd give myself the advice,, probably stay near home, and to have, really pursued other options, rather than just being fully invested in moving to california, um, my best friend would describe me, as great charismatic funny ending, socially enjoyable person who is different from how, people who are not my good friends would describe me, what i mean i don't mean i mean it's what it is i, i am very outgoing and have a great time when i am with my friends in my element but around strangers and in how unpleasant groups and things i just, i am very shy and, not really., speak a lot, recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clipper basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that, yeah, that's good., um, i'm very caring., i, i am a very good judge of character, what i mean i think i mean i consider it a quality < qu> quality for myself, um, i am very loving <aff>, i mean,, i'm not very tender, i'm more, i mean, i guess i guess so, thank you.",10
414,"yeah, that's good., i'm fine., burbank california, yeah, that's good., the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather, um, it's not too, city like chicago or new york, it's big enough that we have beaches that we haven't locked., sometimes the smog, transport, the fact that i was just here, like my whole life almost, not enough because i'd like to go to school in chicago., and i've been to new york a few times, san francisco and i made a road trip through the country, that was cool i saw a few states, see new places, um, go to places of interest that i only have, over or seen images of, um, i traveled from los angeles to chicago under route sixty six, and the best part was to see the grand canyon for the first time, it was, the coolest thing i've ever seen, probably <laughter>, happy, and then it was just happy it was nice it was nice, i haven't felt that way in a long time., i studied film., it's just, something i've always loved as long as i can remember and when it came time to start, i wasn't sure what i was going to do., and, i applied to the northwest as a film student, and it just ended up as the right decision, oh,, um, i love making movies, but part of me really loves, make people laugh and stand in front of the camera, so, uh, comedian a comedian <comie> <laughter> comedian actor would be awesome, but, that's hard <laughter>, i'm super exiting, and i love talking to people, i like to be the center of attention usually <laughter>, i um, i like watching mindless tv, how to, small children in tiaras and around, entendynastie only t v programs where i really don't have to pay attention to all, i'm fine., i, really getting, emotional really fast, but i'm usually, be able to , to keep my anger down and not like eyelashes on others and so on, for the most part, sometimes, i get in like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are really easy to care about, and i hate to apologize to people so the fights can take quite a long time, um, my best friend <laughter> ryan i think, and it was about, our relationship and only, how we kind of messed it up and crossed some boundaries and, how about we get back to the way it was before?, really hard, it's.., he's my best friend and i miss him., but, we screwed it up, and it's just not the same thing., it's not like the same friendship <laughter>, me too <laughter>, <laughter>, i guess.., , when i had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend, which was not okay, i wish i had just, realized that this was bad, and would have just stopped there and not let it go on for weeks, which has led to my separation., and then our friendship gets really messed up, i don't appreciate spending as much time with him as i did, be more confident, um, i guess.., it was, november, i was very depressed and suicidal, so i told my friend., what i felt, and that she had to take me to the e r, and from the e r i had the choice,, i don't know, i guess i'm going home or being sent to a psychiatric clinic., and even though i felt that i had no choice, i knew it was my choice and i, decided to go to the psychiatric clinic that was like the worst experience of my life ever, um, exhale it was terrible, it was in chicago and around, it was scary., i mean, i didn't know anybody, and they like all your stuff, and they put you in some scrubs, and they just.., start giving you medication and you are basically left to your own devices, there were only three group therapy sessions a day and everyone was there, mostly men and.. they were all really old., and, it was scary that i didn't know anyone most people there were not depressed, they were violent <laughter>, so that was pretty scary, and i.., it was really hard for me <laughter>, i was as depressed for as a month, i stopped going to my classes and working and i told my teachers lies, about being sick and i just called sick to work, i dropped a class and i failed my classes and didn't turn in any work and, i haven't spoken to any of my friends and, i was, drink much and faint and vomiting everywhere and, i was just in a really bad place., and when i finally tried to kill myself, i realized i needed help., it was, um, i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager, and then i tried to kill myself, and i was put into therapy for some time, so, i thought i didn't want to go down., again this bad way, i just want to get better, so i had to do it i had to get help, i go once a week, i feel like you have the right therapist., it's really useful, i had a therapist i really liked, and i thought we could have gone really far, but, unfortunately, she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles, so i have to, i have to deal with this new therapist, and she's fine., she is not, we are not going to sleep, so great together, but she's the one i've had right now, it's better than nothing <laughter>, not so easy at all, um, since <yawn>, i came out of the hospital and started, and i started taking medication for my depression, i um, i just couldn't sleep well., sleeping is hard to stay <laughter> sleeping is hard, have really, crazy vibrant dreams, who wake me up and disturb me, um, i just guess, sometimes they reflect, things i'm worried about, or happens in my life, but they are just, they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mother how we were here, we did that did this really happen, and it's usually not you dreaming that, sometimes i get so scared i like to talk in sleep and wake myself up, probably <laughter> like two nights ago, this is a, hard question, i think, november <yawn>, after i got out of the hospital, i finally had a good day, and my friend took me with him., downtown chicago, and we went to the sailor's tower, and must look, about the like big windows you go out and see the city, and that was really cool, <laughter>, super starting, he likes to be at the center of attention, funny and a little crazy, i'm not trying to regret things in my life, oh, um, i would say that, life is worth it, and don't be afraid to ask for help, if you need it, don't wait until it gets really bad, i guess my ideal weekend would be <laughter>, sleep and then, catching a movie with my friends, maybe go home with them and, bake some biscuits <laughter> eat all cookies, watch some t v have a sleep over, and then how to make pancakes in the morning, and see more movies we see a lot of movies i would like to do that <laughter> in my spare time, go for a walk i don't know, go to the beach <laughter>, that's a difficult question., i mean, i think i have, i've done a lot of great things in my life., and, i've achieved a lot, but, i think one of the proudest things, proud moments in my life is something really small and insignificant, i did this training boat camp and, the last person who crossed the finish line had to like, thirty push ups and, it was a guy i didn't really know him at all and the coach said that someone wants to help him, if someone helps him, you have to do half everyone, and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start with him to make push ups, and i just, it wasn't because i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good that i did it., and no one really knows about it, but it's just me feeling really good about it, it was nice., it meets you <laughter> bye",16
415,"yes, i'm fine., michigan, two years ago, every three months, it's more homey and country as fast paced and stuff., i work in the entertainment business, so i had to be out here., it was pretty easy because i lived in new york first and if you can survive new york, you can survive l a, the weather of course beaches, people are much ruder and meaner than what i'm used to, but i like l a, uh graphic design media art, to get to high school i was in front of all my classes and credits, so i had to take a college course, so while in high school, i got a two year college degree to do it because i was good at it., yeah, that's good., yeah, but now i want to go into something else, um i am in school actually i am online courses now for business management, <laughter> i really want to one day i own myself and my sisters want to own our own uh rental real estate and, how uh, real estate company we own six houses now we have bought money with our college, and now we want to own our own houses and apartment complexes, yeah, that's good., meeting new people who see different things you've never seen before to see different languages all the things the world has to offer, oh, okay, me and my sisters went to hawaii last year., to i think we went to hawaii <hawa> honolulu and to, then mmaui yes, and we met the people in hawaii and they were so nice, if i could live there, i would, um, everything was unforgettable, but probably jet skiing, in honolulu has been very fun, yeah, that's good., outward, music, music is a lot of therapy for me, to good my family is very musically inclined like my father and my mom family so, music has always been like that, no matter how i feel, when i put music on it, it makes it much better, i'm pretty good i used to box so it left a lot of frustration, so sometimes i do that i also go to the gym and i do like a kickbox course, but i didn't escalate to the point where i like, bluffs out or no i can pretty much control it, well, i live with my sisters, so i argue every day <laughter> but it was about clothes my sisters and clothes always clothes, my mother my father are pastors of a church, i grew up with two sisters and an older brother who was a cop., and we're pretty close, i have a nephew, we're pretty close, like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house, but we're together every day at one point, when we lived in one, when we in mirigan my family is anyway in mirigan, um, when i cheat as i am at the moment i'm on a diet with my sisters, but last night i sneaked and got mcdonalds, so i feel bad because they held on to it and i cheated, but that's pretty much <laughter it, um, hmm, mm me and mine when i and my friend of mine put in them, and, we said things that weren't like we hit under the belt, and we and we didn't normally do it, and we haven't talked in three months., and i know that it would have been prevented if we had just sat down and talked to each other, but it wasn't so far, yeah, that's good., um, probably moving here, move to l a, because, as i am i'm really how close we are to our family as i skype with my mom and dad every day, so it was hard to go from there to here and they take care of everything, to me and my sisters have to do it on their own, it was a lot different., oh, my goodness., my parents my brother, my father my mother my sisters my family <fam> i have a great family so my family definitely, um, i want to say , two years ago three years ago, my brother was shot on duty., and he almost lost his life, but he didn't, and for some reason, as much as i try, i don't tell them, because i don't want them to be the way i need them to know whatever., i keep thinking about it and i'm gonna cry about how it happened yesterday, but it happened three years, just the mere fact of almost losing him., mode, yeah, that's good., not just i work as, personal assistant and administrative assistant for a caster, so i'm on call for them whenever i'm never getting a good night's sleep, i know <laughter>, to be a zombie <laughter> i'm pretty much, you'd never know, because if it was work, i'm professional, so if i was tired, they'd never know,, but i am very angry and very grouchy when i have not slept, to <sigh>, tired, and i have crazy headaches, but that's probably not enough sleep and work too much, of course., very tired, yeah, that's good., definitely, i'm shorter with people like, being in the industry, i mean, people don't really care about it, it's just about themselves., and when i first came here, i had the personality and attitude of the family and love and being nice and here showed me that everyone was somehow here for themselves, also those like the other girls i work with, so i've learned to cut people off and be short with people if that's not really me, but all i can see is that you have to be like this <laughter>, no, no, to <sigh>, last saturday, i got a weight in and i lost seven pounds i was as excited as, so <laughter> that was the last time, um, care too much, uh, i'm thinking more about others than i am, so she'd say that it's too important to me that i love it., i'm the person that every friend i've trusted in from best friend to only normal friend, so yeah, i'm the mother of my friends, um, no i regret nothing, hmm, never take no as an answer, um, i wish i could, well, i don't personally know that i want to lose like twenty pounds more, but, i'm just.., i don't know if i'm a little more., adventurous, little more adventurous, to <sigh>, i don't think i had a time, baby feels bad no, i can't., no, i don't think i have one, i'm sorry i don't think i have one., oh well, me and my sisters just started yoga and, we make the beach like every friday, but, yoga is like our new addiction, so we do yoga and we probably go to a spa or something, this is an ideal <ide>, yeah, that's good., um, my job, my career because i got a pretty long way at twenty, the work i'm doing, so i'm pretty, quite proud of it, you're welcome., see you.",3
416,"safe, i'll be all right. how are you?, manufacture from materials of any heading, except those of the same heading as the product, yeah, that's good., about twenty five years ago, yeah, it's been a while., actually, i'm not back yet <laughter> i like l a, i like l a, mm it's a big city, so it's kind of similar, but the weather isn't the same, so l a must love for the weather, family i was a child, it took a little adjustment, but not hard, around the weather, um, i can't imagine anything from the bat, but i wouldn't want to go, so my family is here, so that's another reason i don't want to go., transport < slaughter>, not really, but i've traveled a little yeah, new places see different people how they live their lives, i used to be at monterey california., last <la> or middle of last year, that was very nice, um, that's a good question., i'm not sure., there are probably, i can't think of anything from the bat that makes me think it's kind of weird, but <laughter>, astronomy, yeah, that's it., <tisk> i don't know that just somehow fell into it took a course it liked and then took something more and somehow just walked down the road, no, there's not much work to do., it's kind of limited., yes, it does <laughter>, my dream job, i'd like to own, a restaurant, a nice restaurant in the bar, well, i'd like something a little higher than, most places you go to, or at least in the area i live in most places, don't seem very somehow just like a dive bar just somehow, worn run down so, something beautiful, something different, something creative, something pulsating for you know, pulls a lot, but it's probably expensive, so i don't know if it's really plausible, i'm definitely shyer, but i can go if i'm comfortable with people, but, at first i'm pretty shy, good idea, to a lot of times i, try, just, lie back and you know you're breathing deeply., just somehow purify your mind, or maybe you just see a movie listening to music is good reading a book, that's what just takes your head off, relax, i got much better at it <laughter> i had problems with it when i was younger, but i'm good i'm good at it now, i learned you shouldn't., respond immediately to situations you should, you know, think before you talk about this kind of thing, my ex girlfriend, when we broke up three months ago., um, we're relationship was just not very good, so it just went a predictable way and we were just arguing about the same old stuff and, it wasn't really a memorable argument, but it was an argument, so that's all i can think about and i haven't really seen it since, i don't know that it's nothing special, just a typical argument between two people who had been separated, frustrated, for example , yeah, i guess,, everyone sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure their way was right so try to convince someone that, you know, of your ideas or what you think is more difficult than it is because everyone is looking out for themselves somehow., <tisk> but yes, mm that's a good example right there with the girlfriend that i couldn't have reacted a little different and didn't show so much emotion, there were times in my life when i had a fight with friends or something you know., or earlier relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted as i knew i wasn't doing anything bad, but just more of uh, you know that you are more mature about it and don't know that you reveal your feelings so much, or, this kind of thing, leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen, that was a long time ago, i went to school in san diego and i, immediately wanted to come back so, i ruined our relationship, and we're still friends, and i wish i hadn't., mm, i feel that i can contribute more to my family and friends, i think i could do better, i think i'm selling myself so short, job opportunities are hard to get, but if i could find a good job, i would be much happier because i could take care of myself and others, so don't be such a burden for the people around me, it's good., it's very good., we're pretty open and i see my mom and dad and my sister pretty often, it's a good relationship, i mean, we get along well., i could mean it's not perfect, but it's good, <tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper, around probably irritable there, it's harder to do tasks, it's kind of like you're feeling weird or something because you don't have that much energy and, good, relatively good, spring time always makes everyone feel comfortable, no, not at all., never, i really mean, we feel happy every day, but it's probably been a while., around probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we had a good time so it's probably like a month and a half or so when i was really happy, i wish i were more, i guess.., firmly committed to my goals and i wish i would have driven better to be successful i don't know that i usually settle for less, so, i don't know., i guess that's.., the quiet behavior part of me that is good and bad <laughter>, anyway, i'm alive right now, and then you realize that five ten years have passed and you should have done something., i'll just stick with it., fighting with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she felt pretty bad about me <laughter>, um, i, i don't know when i was., when i was in high school, i got into a fight with a friend and, i drove., my car too fast and it was an area i didn't know and i hit a turn i didn't know that coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that, but, that was a long time ago, so it's not a big deal now <laughter>, stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>, <tisk>to my parents some of my close friends i have a good group of three or four friends, these were positive influences., yeah, that's good., i'm a caring guy., nice person good heart, a little, a little unmotivated must improve on certain aspects of his life, make yourself better and, passionately i appreciate passionately in a good and bad way < laughter>, well, i take care of myself very much and at the same time, sometimes it gets the best of me, mm, sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or something, you do more than, they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated, so that's an example., yeah, probably, but i can't think of anything out of my head., , focus more on the school, because while you're young, you have the ability to, multitasking, and, , mm, i don't know., really enjoyed i mean i do things every day i enjoy, but really enjoyed i don't know, i don't know, i cleaned some things out of my room, so it was nice to spill an old garbage so that it was okay, but i don't know if i really enjoyed it, but, i felt satisfied after it, mm, i think i could do better, i feel like an underachiever, so not much i don't know, i am organized very detailed, i like to finish tasks, it's very important to me that you know i'm very caring., i have good intentions in mind, i don't like to falsify people, i don't like to lie, because once you lie, one lie leads to another, so i don't like it., but yes, that's, that's it., <laughter> cool, have a good day.",3
417,"yes, i'm fine., uh los narrower <laughter>, i don't know <laughter>, um, it's kind of dirty, but that's to be expected from a big city, to my last class i took was a sociology class, i'm not sure where i'm going with school, but i'm thinking about sex education, i think it's a really important job., i feel like, uh, because there's some kind of uh, stigma i think about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies, so i feel like it's a very important job for, the world <laughter>, i don't know <laughter>, no, lack of resources, it depends on the people, but i would say that i'm generally more shy., of course with people i know well, as if they were closer to me i am more going away, to play with my dogs, uh, i don't know if it's a nice day, i'm going for a walk., um, if it's not a nice day, or if it's cold or something, uh maybe you see a show on t v i like or read a book or something, i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper., i can't remember thinking the last person i argued with, was my friend, probably last week, but i don't even remember what it was about <laughter>, um, i don't think i feel really guilty about everything i would say i regret things, but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret., as i think guilt is more like a bad feeling, but regret is like, you should have made another decision., i think this can help you in, better decisions to make in the future while guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <laughter>, um, i don't regret doing better when i was in high school, um, uh, i don't mean getting better grades, um, i regret uh, how to engage with certain people in the past, but i mean, i'm not sure <laughter>, that's what i'm thinking about right now <laughter>, hm, um, yeah, i mean, in the past., yeah, i could have done it., different decisions, i mean obviously some things that you know you're not quite in your control, but i won't feel like i'm not gonna regret things that i had no power over so, um, i don't know if i want to erase it from my memory., but, i wish it hadn't happened to me when i was raped., <laughter> i can't imagine tough decisions., hm, i can't think of a laughter. , hm, i'm not sure <laughter> i can't imagine any, i have a pretty good relationship with my family., uh not, i wouldn't say i'm really close to my mother, but i mean, we get along well., and i'm very close to my sister, we're basically best friends, um, hm, i think my mother was a positive influence in my life, uh, because she was always able to take care of me and she always, i didn't mean she did it., like mistakes sometimes, but i think she was always there for me when i needed it, and she did her best to educate me., i think she was a great positive influence, it's been easy lately., sometimes i have trouble sleeping, but uh, lately i have had no problems, um, it depends on how long i have gone without sleep, i can only, be somewhere from like, to like groggy around, really at the edge, and how to, extremely tired <laughter> i don't know, i felt, pretty good i uh, i'm kind of like general fear all the time, but it's not as bad as it's been, in the past, so, mostly felt pretty good, i think i really felt, more happy in recent times, i wouldn't say that all the time i'm really happy i'm usually just kind of, for example , um, neutral, but i have the feeling, more recent positive, i'm not sure i was diagnosed with p t s d., um, uh, i know that i uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like, since i was sixteen, ahem for depression, and i think my first psychologist i saw for a few years, thought i had p t s d, but i'm not sure if she, ever made a diagnosis, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, uh, i am <laughter> i don't know, yes, um, it's helpful, uh, talk to someone and have them somehow, um, you can take part in, talk about something so you can figure out the thing that your, feelings about things i think for yourself or how it helps to talk to someone because you can figure out why you feel a certain way about something, i mean,, i think you can do this on your own sometimes, but.., uh, talking to someone helps me think, um, hm, i'm not sure <laughter>, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, um, i'm not sure <laughter>, uh, i think i'd spend it most of the time., at home, but it would be sunny outside and i would go outside a little, and i would play with my dogs and, uh, i'd probably have my friend over., um, i'd eat food i like, like just food i like my favorite food around, clock, movie or t v show that i like, um, only, kind of have like a relaxing time, but, that's nice., mm, i'd say to myself, uh, to make it better at school because i was kind of an underachiever during high school, and i ended up at community college going like this because i want to, lose type of interest and then, uh not doing well, or as good as i could have, so i'd say to myself,, do as well as i could at school because i feel i'm able to do too much more, when i do it, and i think i would have easily received a scholarship if i had done well in high school, so i'd say good at school, probably warn me of one or two people who, turned out not worth my time <laughter>, um, hm, um, i think i'm, proud of me, for not, be, bitter and for willful, to, uh, well, i'm kind of bitter i guess but i guess i'm proud of myself, for not being selfish and wanting, to make the world a better place, because a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to stay instead., i'm trying to, um, or i want to, to make things better for other people, and as much as i want to help i think to empower people to make their lives better, see you.",7
418,"yes, i'm fine., i was born in mississippi, when i was two and a half years old, but actually it wasn't l a it was santa monica, yes, never, i was only two and a half years old, i don't remember anything., oh, i like the beach, i love all the restaurants, um, around the music scene just the general excitement oh and the parks and all that, yeah, that's good., to transport, the, maintenance on the streets all pot holes, um, um, pollution, i studied a number of things at school., i've been studying to, to at one point i was in public relations journalism specialization in journalism, and i also studied around i was a pre law major, and so, i have studied the law and then i have also studied to, um, man.., human services courses, mhm, mainly because i'm a human being, and i enjoy helping people, wow my dream job, hm, mm, my dream job, hm, i don't really have one right now., no, i can't even see your shoes., um, to listen to music, watch horror movies i love <luh> i love horror movies, um, and i also have a fish tank, so i like to look at my fish, also like to play tennis when i can not be able to play lately, although due to physical problems, um, mm, it's just that.., i had hurt my ankle because i had anaemia <anenia> and, and i got dizzy one night and fell on my ankle and on my leg and so i'm just waiting for this to really heal, but i plan to come back to tennis, it's one of the things i enjoy doing, really relaxes me, i really have no temperament over the years, i've learned how to control it., probably it would have been yesterday, but there was no argument., and what it was about, nothing i can remember <laughter>, something i feel guilty about, hm, there's nothing i feel guilty about right now., mm, oh, a situation i wish i'd treated differently, i really can't imagine anyone right now., the toughest decision oh, um, the absolutely toughest decision i've ever had to make, um, was when my uh i twins boys they've grown now, i had twins, twin teen, and i had lost my job and we lived in a motel, and, the rent for the motel was outrageous i couldn't pay any more the, in order to pay for the kind of money they wanted, i had to pay for it., um, put my son under the nursing ward for a minute., that was the hardest decision i had to make, , around a schizophrenic, and he had, he was born with an auditory processing deficit, which he overcame by training with a speech therapist and school official, and he also lost his hearing when he was four years old., um, but.., and then, when he became fourteen, schizophrenia came, so he's in a supportive environment right now, where he's twenty seven years old., but he's settled with his mental illness and now he accepts it., i had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication you'd give him, and he hid it, put it in his pocket or whatever., well, but he got along with it, and we all got along with it, and he's doing him pretty good., , the son is twenty, he's seven, as i said, because he's a twin., um, um lived in texas with his wife, and he got a promotion to.., , now he's in california, both of them in california., um, i feel very good about the yeah, uh, hm, good from adult children yes, <laughter> of adult children yes, no, i'll take that back., not it's not hard to be a parent of adults of my adult children okay when they were younger, there were difficult times okay difficult periods and around, it was also a lot of good times, but yes, there were some difficult times., mm, well, the mm the difficult times that i've really been alluding to a lot and that was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and, and, they were in, temporary and, in the good one was in the care and one was actually in an institution because of the about the schizophrenia, um, so, think i've lost track of the question <laughter>, the hardest part about being a parent, at this point at this point in my life, there's nothing serious about it., um, the best thing about being a parent, i don't know, i guess it's just to see <cough>, something you created to develop into a pretty decent person you know, a decent person., that's the best., oh, many ways, well, actually., i didn't have two parents, i had a mother., and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him around, but the thing i do, unlike what my mother did, um, she was a strong disciplinary, both oral and physical, um, and, she at her had this tendency that she grew out of, she had this tendency to be very critical, okay critical and.., to oppose <laughter> and very religious, um, and somehow, i looked at people who weren't, and that was me as if they were, were life wrong because they did not go to church or read the bible and this kind of thing, what was the other part, on the question, i don't sleep well or i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is if i don't take medication, i don't sleep, i'll be awake all night i'll be awake, i'll be up for days if i don't take medication., man irritable around, and tired <laughter>, all right., lately, you know, just a little scared really around, you know, i just.., made a move to a new apartment it is a lot of cost and, new issues and things like that you know and new furniture and new this and that that you have to do all this, but, the whole thing was kind of stressful., yes mhm, no p t s d, yes, um, that was back in i think two thousand and four, um, because my life had become so stressful, up to the point where , it was either i had to do something or, or stop something to tell you the truth yeah, um, yeah,, yes, i think it's useful to you to know as a good sounding record, you know someone to throw, you know, your concerns and you know, discuss things that bother you or good things to yes, i think therapy with medications, um, since i went to therapy, in order to make the changes, a lot of changes to, i was more focused., more, hopeful, um, hm, it was just a good experience for me, which is why i keep going, really happy, all right., i can feel really happy, i can't think of anything about an incident right now, just like that., and then, i go back to what i felt, so i really can't determine exactly what i mean., anyway i mean, if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right, unlike things that go wrong all the time, that it makes me happy if things go right, how about, hm, mm something i've done recently, that i really, something i did recently that i really enjoyed, my really really enjoyed, recently, hm, i can't think of anything., i don't have a best friend., to my best qualities, are that , i'm an honest person., i really give people the benefit of doubt, to all in my book, is what they seem to be, until they prove it's different, um, i'm very generous., too generous <laughter>, um, and i'm very fond of helping other people, i mean, help me that i'm on a personal level to help people., you know what their problem is, i enjoy doing something for someone else that helps them,, mhm, everything i regret, how is that possible?, there's only one thing i regret and that's that, um, after my twins became old enough to, start to the school of primary school level around, i took a few courses as a pre law major., and, at that time i was married to her father, who has proved not to be good, fit for me, and, because of the burdens associated with him, you know this would end and i'd leave him., um, i left college., so that was my greatest regret, hm, stay in school, no matter what, stay the course, no matter what, that i'm a good person, i'm a good person, that's all., all right., goodbye.",10
419,"yes, i'm good, thank you., around i was born in mexico city, yes, about thirty four years ago, yes <laughter>, i try to go back once a year, but i haven't been here for three years., i haven't had the time yet and i've traveled to other places, but i plan to probably go back next year., well, i can never see me retreating to mexico city, it's a huge city and, i like l a more there are more possibilities and, i feel like i'm at home here, my family moved here, as i said, i was very young and my parents moved to california to work, and then we just stayed here., i love traveling, i didn't travel as much as i'd like, but i love to travel., to see only new things that people from other countries meet.., feel relaxed and have no worries because you are on vacation, i love being easy, in other places, the last trip i made was a seven day cruise., and it went to saints thomas barbados saint lucia, um, saint martin, and it was amazing, i would love to do this journey again, um, i think going to mexico the last time i was there, i went to the pyramids teotihuacan and i had not been there in many years and it was just amazing to see, the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such large structures, i think i'm more shy., around in social situations i feel somehow uncomfortable, i'm not one to just, go to the people and start talking, when people come to me, of course, i'll talk to them, but i feel a little embarrassed., kind of out of place at a party, i've studied history., i've always been interested in history., and i just wanted to learn stories from other cultures and of course u s history, so i'm very much in history, i actually work in education., my dream job would actually be to travel around the world and have a show like the travel channel < laughter> that would be my dream job because i would be paid to travel and it's something i'd like to do, do, um, so i'd like to do this as a job, i love to read, and i love to take baths so relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bathroom, and i also like to go to the gym that helps me uh, dealing with stress and, it relaxes me, even if i train., um, i wasn't very good at controlling it when i was a kid, i would easily go crazy., and sometimes as an adult i still get angry, easy, but i've been much better at, try to think about things first before they say, and, without outbreaks, things like this, the last time i had a fight with someone, it was probably my best friend a week ago., and she actually has children i don't have., and for some reason she thought, or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and, she didn't do it and she's home with kids and you know i can do more things, i don't think i ever gave her the feeling that.., i and i definitely don't know how i feel better than them, but for some reason they accused me of it and we had an argument about it., um, i wish i'd handled differently, because, when she spoke to me, she was very upset and, i started pretty calm, just trying to argue with her and let her know that i certainly didn't feel like i was better than her, but towards the end of the conversation it somehow turned into a scream, match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and, maybe she asked me to call later, as soon as we calmed down, instead of just continuing the argument., i was angry at first, but once we hung up, i felt really bad about the situation., i thought maybe i could have just left her., omit all her feelings and then try to talk to her calmly, instead of yelling at them,, oh wow around, that's a tough thing, i think., god, i think one of the toughest decisions i had to make is the separation with a friend of seven years., um, although i knew it was the right thing to do i was, the fact that we were together for so many years and, i felt by ending the relationship., i would have wasted the last seven years of my life., it was a pretty hard decision to make, but i realized it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm really glad i did., because then i went on to meet myself, my husband, thank you., well, i'd say, maybe, fifteen years ago i was, with a few friends on one, association, and they met some guys and invited us to their house., and i really didn't want to go because i didn't know these people and i mean, i knew their names and that was it, but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving, so i decided to just go with them, and, back at her house around, one of the boys, actually pulled me into a room and, tried, i got scared i screamed, he tried to suffocate me and i thought, i wanted to die right there, i thought he was gonna kill me., but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door, because she heard me scream and we went, so, it could have been a worse situation, but i'm still thinking about it and i wish i could erase it from my head, it was, we have a pretty good relationship, i'm close, i have a sister and a brother., my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older, and we get out pretty well, my sister and i used to be best friends, but then we grew apart and now we're actually closer than ever., and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents, my father., still treats me like a little child sometimes < laugh> what annoys me, but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship, yeah, that's good., i usually wake up, a few times during the night, um, so, i think it's rare for me to sleep, all night long, um, and i feel a little bit, how tired in the morning, when i wake up, it's hard, i'm not a morning person definitely, um, so yeah, it's kind of hard to get a good night's sleep, i don't know., i've got a hard time falling asleep, and then sometimes i have bad dreams or, i have to get up to use the toilet., of course., i don't remember the last time i actually slept all night without waking up at least once., um, emotional good, i'm on vacation from work right now, so that's really nice., um, physically i feel good i haven't been in the gym for a while so somehow, gives me the feeling, bad because i like to train, but to be healthy, i'm good <laughter>, no, no, um, it was, last weekend i actually went out of town with my husband, we didn't go very far, we went to santa barbara., we really enjoyed ourselves around we went wine tasting and, went to the beach and just had a really good time, she would probably describe me as a good caring person., um, patients, very shy, um, she would probably also say that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors because i always do things for other people., well, yeah, that's how she'd describe me., i wish i were more absent, um, i wish that, i, what else is it?, in any case more outgoing, um, so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i'm very shy, i also wish i could have more patience than i did <laughter> sometimes i'm very close to patience, and i wish i could, find a better job so i could do more travel, um, yes i really have a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree, and i really wish i had, you know i took care of it a lot earlier than i did., um, and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend, i would have told myself to focus on school., go out and hang out and just, you know, and going to parties around wasn't as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first, i'm proud i haven't been to school for so many years., go to u c l a and get my degree, um, yes, that would be my most proud achievement, all right., thank you., see you.",3
420,"mm, yes, i am., i'm fine., manufacture from materials of any heading, except those of the same heading as the product, around back and forth over the years and traveled a little, they haven't been out there in over fifteen sixteen years., um, somehow stuck out here <laughter> then i had my baby and i just stayed, uh, miscellaneous food for, people understand each other, as i understand it, it's a kind of culture shock., uh, out there just based on the food they like to give you a lot of food, this tastes really good for a little money to keep a lifelong customer, but out here they want to go up there and give you a little food for a whole lot of money, so they only make money <laughter>, um, the parents had a business here., um, not heavy, i could get used to anywhere, the view and the sea, uh, just.., a division of the people that it is <laughter>, just a few places, learn to see different people and learn how different people interact and interact with each other, <laughter>um, uh, i remember a trip years ago where i went to mexico with my brother, yeah, that's good., um, jump into a lake <laughter> quite far from the side of a mountain <laughter>, yeah, that's good., all, there's no subject i don't like., um, actually my dream job, working with computers and helping people, this is, where my heart is i like computers and i also like to help people, i meditate to train, i'm running, i'm running., um, i'm writing read, median, mm, i'd say very good., oh yeah, that doesn't make it seem so good <laughter> the last time i argued, has been, about someone who actually spits out a racial mess, to my wife, angry, annoyed pain, disrespectful, and especially when i went up there to actually treat the person i treated them with dignity and respect and tried to help the person at first, it's not a problem people are people, mm, i had a chance at school to really go a lot further than i did, and i leave something very small, and without meaning stop me in the persecution of him, um, ignorance, <laughter> due to lack of a better word, now that i'm thinking about it again, i could have done a lot to avoid it, but i was just young and stupid, to live again, um, as much pain as i have seen in the world, um, a compilation of all events uh just different bad things i've seen, i, if i could change it, i would, sometimes, i guess things are for a reason, even if we may not understand, um, i have no answer to that., um, blood family we really don't talk about, my wife, i don't know if she really wants to be with me or not, she thinks i'm doing everything in the world, but that i'm not, and really <laughter>, i don't understand., i know my daughter loves me, but i don't know if she wants to be with me or not., because, when someone talks to you, when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in them voice and belief in their eyes, if you say something so often, that's what really lies in your heart., <sharp inhalation> so you can say whatever through your mouth, but it's what really is there, i love my daughter, she an angel i cut her umbilical cord, i went out there and put on her first shirt., i saw her come out., she looked at me right out of her stomach <laughter> she wouldn't fight with the doctors wouldn't let her touch a little bit, i talked to her, i told her to calm down, or i told her it was daddy that she looked at me and grabbed my fingers and how she calmed down and just let her do everything they had to do., no, the task is constantly changing, what you have to do that day won't be the same as the next day or the next one after that, it's always around, what is a better word for it around, <laughter>um, adjustment, um, the most difficult thing i'll probably say, is, scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for her not learn the wrong lessons, <laughter> see your baby smile in appreciation, i'm trying to guard my baby a lot more of things she sees, um, when i was younger there were a lot of things i saw no child or adult should have seen, and, if < whe>, i've grown up, i have sworn that i will always take care of my child and, i wouldn't disappear or, let them be near such things., um, my old foster parents, mm, they basically showed me no matter where you come from, they can always strive to get better, um, a good night's sleep, oh, um, it's coming., the same only tired and yawning <laughter>, how i felt, mm, for example , i have a plethora of questions and, an abundance of gold, in my, gripping and it's right out of my reach, because i just need the one, plug to really just, to see what i'm capable of and i know i'm capable of too much, it's just, i have to make this connection., no, um, mm not p t s d no, uh, i said yes, but, i don't think i'm more depressed or something than any other person who has all their different breakpoints., my daughter's birthday on the twenty sixth, she took her out to chuck e cheese she had fun she played games she was on bikes < deep breath> she was crawling around through puzzle games, man this girl did above all <laughter>, um, fun loyally caring, um, something to change, i'd like to be more precise, don't know who my mother was, stop thinking about what else happened, and just do what you have to do., i'm positive i'm goal oriented, determined, um, i am very imaginative, very creative, < slaughter> ideal, i would probably, make a little bit of everything, climbing cycling, hiking with my daughter places around, <laughter> human, i will probably go snowboarding and everything <laughter> in an ideal weekend, my daughter, no problem, goodbye.",3
421,"yeah, that's fine., i'm fine., how are you?, originally i am from san francisco, originally i moved here in gosh nineteen ninety five, then i went to chicago, then to san francisco and then back to go close probably about five years ago, a lot moves <laughter>, never, um, there's just nothing left for me, the weather is better in l a, but the people in san francisco are nicer, my husband prefers <pref> my ex husband prefers it here, so we moved, i have an undergraduate degree in psychology and then i went to law school, when i was in college, i worked at a law firm., and decided that i really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting, no now i am a stay at home mama, , no, um, i love it, but it's, difficult you need to manage a life to make sure that they, will be, a good and successful person, uh <sigh> i it's easy, somehow the academics and so that you know that i'm good, that the hardest thing i think is to lead them, emotional, to help him through things he has, a hard time with the feeling that i don't have all the answers, just to see them grow and experience new things and, learning about life and the world it's just it's really really cool, completely different <laughter>, completely different me and i'm not a perfect parent but i love my son i take care of him, he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all, my parents are dead., i didn't even talk to my dad before he died., i have a sister and a brother who actually doesn't know where they are, and i don't talk to them either., um, probably shyer because i consider myself more reserved, i like to listen to music, i have to listen to all kinds of music, but my favorite when i relax is uh eighties music <laughter> cheesy cheesy, but true, it depends on who i'm with when i'm with my son., i can control my temperament, um, when i'm at it, my ex husband or other adults mm yeah <ye> yeah i don't, so so so so, yesterday, and it was about my ex husband with the woman he cheated on when we were married., um, i found out he cheated on me, and i threw him out., and he told me yesterday that he was still with her., yeah, that's good., um, really angry, and just very hurt, um, i wish i had, spoke to my father before he died, i wish i had settled our differences before he died., the hardest decision i've ever had to make was actually, to end my marriage, because he cheated on me, um, that should be, well, i don't know, i mean, i don't know if i want to erase something from my memory because it makes me, who i am today, so i can't really think of an event that i want to delete, i don't sleep well, it's not easy for me to wake up a lot at night., i don't know, i wish i knew if i knew i could change it, i could try to do something about it, but i just don't know., um, dimples irritable, uh, grumpy irritable around, bottom, mixed with anger < sigh>, it's, just because of everything i'm going through with my, soon to become ex husband, yes, there it is., um, i'll just keep it in., i mean, there's nothing else to do except exce> i mean, it's what it is, so, i have to, how to deal with it, no, yes, ten years ago, after my son was born, or nine years ago, i felt like, i couldn't handle life., i was so depressed., i couldn't believe i couldn't do anything., no, i'm not going to therapy, i'm going to medication management., but i'm not doing talk therapy., i went to the therapist's, and no, they're not helping., um, well, some just sit and stare at you and say nothing, you know, if i wanted to talk to myself,, others give advice that i think is just, it's just not good and not on the point, um, it was probably this morning that i was playing with my son., just really happy that i haven't thought about it, one of the other shit <sigh>, to in my life i could just forget it, so i felt really happy, ugh, i think they would describe me completely differently than the way i would describe myself, but, um, i think they'd describe me as really sweet, because they're really cute., confident, uh, going out., because that's what i'm trying to be for people, so i think they'd describe me like this., i wish i wasn't sad, i wish i was more confident, um, yes, there are a lot of things, i think, it would be.., not, not, give my life over to a certain person who is what i did with my husband, i think i would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son, hanging around the pool with fun going to dinner, uh, one of my two friends two really good friends i think were really positive influences in my life, um, , your life is worse than mine, but we can always get together., , is just really positive i mean, she's always happy up always looking for the bright side, so that's helped me a lot, my son, i went to a friend's home and we had movie night we saw ourselves an adult movie and dinner and wine, and the guys were in another room watching movies and video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening, mhm, safe <laughter>, see you.",10
422,"hi, safe, all right., uh original i'm from uh korea, mhm, when i was a year old, yes, i've almost never been to korea., uh i love the weather <sigh> and being at the sea and the culture has a lot of things to do, the food there is a lot to like, um, transport in order to , it seems as if, we have a lot of uh economic difficulties and the, the parking cards are super high i sometimes i really am, annoyed by our government <laughter>, by your shoes, you said by your shoes, your shoes don't show that i've traveled a little bit, i've somehow traveled, i haven't traveled in a while., oh, just <sigh>, it's.., it helps you keep things in the perspective of our lives here, it's exciting and it makes me feel, i really live because sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l a and we see other places where you realize that, you know, life is about a lot of different things you don't think every day, well, um.., one of my trips i went uh, i went to, singapure and then to thailand, and it was when i was with my ex boyfriend and we went around, he had <ha> he was uh, uh, a sales engineer, or system engineer, but he did well this year and so this was kind of like a company thing, so we went to singapore for a few days, and that was really interesting to you know of course, eh, it's a lot different over there, not just like going to canada or something., but they had a big reception in the evening we arrived there and they had like a piece of the directors of the company, which was really fun and, um, after singapore uh we have some tours in singapore it was really, it was an interesting experience, it's really clean there and it's really, there's not much crime, but the government is very, it's a little intrusive, but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost < almo> it was really completely different because it is like jungle, we went to, it's a small island., and it was just it was very, primitives compared to, singapore only in a lot of different ways, but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap, had a beach massage for eight dollars <laughter>, it was interesting yeah, yes, it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>, mm, well, i'm in school right now., i didn't finish school when i was younger because i.., i had health problems., so around here i am, i'm doing my general ed. i'm going to s m c., yeah, that's good., i'm happy, ooh <sigh> well, my dream job would be <sigh> a vet, but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know, also because of the monetarly it costs a lot, but that would be my dream job working with animals and and, in veterinary capacity, yeah, that's good., i think i'm right at the top around it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and, how comfortable i am, but around i'm really going out when i'm comfortable with people and i'm really being reserved <laughter> if i don't, yeah, that's good., well, i mean next to sleeping, um, i like, like relaxing things uh like going for a bike tour on the strand, or when i'm home uh just like reading or, many times i can just lie there and, my mind could do things, but i'm kind of relaxing, oh, really good., i didn't, i'd say there are certain things that.., they can really, how to make me, like when i see injustices or such things, i mean, i can really feel it, but i never like flying out of the grip or throwing things or, you know you're screaming., argued, to <sigh>, i can't really say that i have arguments that i mean like a disagreement or an actual argument., like if we just, all right., i'd say last summer., if , um, i think it was after a, baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to, we went to have shabu shabu after the game, and, i don't know that i think, , and i don't know it's some kind of tough friendship., she's in a way a good friend and she's in mm we're actually somehow removed in other ways so i don't consider her, like someone i'd confide in and you know if someone, deep problems, but.., sometimes we just.., she's very sensitive., and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do, so i think, she had told me a few things that somehow bothered me that night, but mm, you know i'm just kind of, that's just how she is, and then i guess i said some things they, have been felted, oh, well, she's really getting, slightly offended i think <laughter> but around after that we didn't talk for a while, but then we, then she called me and then we were friends again, but as she never confronted me, difficultest decision <sigh>, it left my ex boyfriend., all right., it wasn't, it's been a long time coming, i mean, i've been thinking about it, for as five years, um, you know, he wasn't like he hit me or something that he was a really good guy, but we.., had a lot to, we <w> we were not always on the same wavelength and we had a lot of same disagreements, so i had thought about it and thought about it and, we've been engaged, but we've been together a long time., i don't know., i was always it was always on my head how should i get married or should i not and then finally, anyway we were just always with, um, we've always been what the word i'm looking for is., we just had this little sniffer, inconsistencies all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i would go and, that's what i did., it was really hard it was the hardest, decision in my life and i can stay that definitely, and, but i think it was the best, deep breath probably leaving my job, for good to help my friend start a business in nevada, and if i if i, i liked my job, i mean, it was pretty good, um, it was right on the beach., and when i told them that i was leaving, they offered me this huge increase and they offered me another position that was awesome, and that was really stressful for me because, i had already promised that my friend <laughter> would go, i wouldn't have gotten the position you could offer if it wasn't, because she wants me to come over there., it was really stressful and i stressed about it for about three weeks until i actually went, and, when i went there, as if we had made agreements on how much they would pay me and bla, when i got there, she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and, the other directors of the company were, you know the <th>, it was a difficult situation because she had spoken to me, but they hadn't spoken to me and they're like good, that's too much, and also, they were another religion, and it was very strange i mean, they were all a religion <laughter> i was surrounded by mormons and i have nothing against mormons, but it was very different because anyway, i was kind of an outsider and then, also the weather was just it was absolutely terrible there <laughter>, so i'd say that's a decision it's making, it's just a central point in my life and i think that around, i really wish i had just stayed, well, if you wipe something out of my memory, i'd probably say,, my memory, like really, if i could erase something from my memory that i want to delete, is that what you say?, mm < sigh>, i can't think of anything., also like this, the bad decision i made, you know, it's worth it, so i can't really say that i'd want to erase something i mean maybe if i raped like or something, and it was really appalling then i would, but i didn't, being in a deep sleep i am in a deep sleep a lot, but, i never feel rested, and that's.., it's a medical problem for me., i always feel good, as if i hadn't slept for two days and, um, there are points in the day, i would say in some < s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel awake and alive and, and rested, but they are short lived, but i sleep a lot i sleep, uh pretty fucked up <laughter> physically pretty fucked up, yeah, that's good., good thanks <laughter>, no, i wasn't officially diagnosed with depression, but.., this is, that's usually what doctors do, um, as if my sleep problem has not yet been diagnosed, i am in the process of real work to get it diagnosed, but this is the first thing they try and, they've given me depression drugs before, but they didn't help me sleep., but i do., i would say i sometimes feel down <someti> good, my life is very strange right now, so there are a lot of reasons to feel down, um, i would say that sometimes i feel depressed., many times, but it's not, i'd say, it's reasonable to think about., the situations in which i am in, they are only triggered by the fact that my health is not great and it makes life really difficult, but.., i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything special., oh, there i mean you mean for a long time or i mean i feel happy when i go out with friends or i go and you know i have, find some great new dish i like i mean, what kind of happiness you're looking for, to <sigh>, all right., i mean, right now.., my girlfriend just had surgery, so i'm staying with her this week., i really enjoy it, i mean, though, we could never live together, i could never live with her long term life and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term, but i'm having fun and.., you know they're just them i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone, yesterday, because she paid too much for laser hair removal., <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's looking for cupcakes, so she let me pick cupcakes up on the way here to get back to her uh as a groupon deal, so i mean,, you know there are such funny little things., uh.., it's probably due to, o c d <laughter> and around, she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her, um, i think that they, tell me i have a good heart., um, and probably that i am, i should ask her <laughter> uh, i don't know we're going out, so she'd say i'm having fun., um, but.., she mentioned that i am a very private person and that i know that i knew before she said that, why?, i've got <ha> good i told you i've got a lot of problems right now, and <sigh>, so i don't really know, people tell about them, um, it's a kind of, it's a kind of killjoy, but also, people can feel i feel that people can feel, less comfortable when they realize that you are having trouble and they feel somehow, um, it's just uncomfortable as oh they might need to help them or they feel guilty, but they have good busy lives so somehow creates a gap, but i'd say even before, even before this difficult time in my life i was, i was a private person, i don't know why., i think, <thi> i think a lot, oh, you know, i'm a deep thinker, and, maybe it's just, you know, don't feel like i'm abnormal, but, um, maybe i just have a lot of thoughts that, don't seem appropriate to share with people, or i'm not sure, 10 or 20 years ago <sigh>, um, well, one thing i regret now is.., you know i didn't really find, someone, you know, spending the rest of my life with it so i'd tell myself to focus more on it, because once you've met forty, it's really <rea> it's a lot harder, that's it., i would say <sigh>, that i have perservered, i'm very proud that, even if i have a lot of, difficulties in my life, the fact that i am you know that this commitment to go to school, and i'll do it alone, and, you know that it, it's a kind of, when people, when people knew all the problems i have, they'd be good, you know why you're worried about school, but.., i really feel that., you know, i'm doing this and i'm really proud that even through everything around i get one, thank you., mm k, thank you., see you.",12
423,"yes, i'm fine., los engles the larger los engles area, people, diversity, and, various entertainment and activities, around unstable weather, transport, and litter, i have not been travelling internationally, to see other places and how people live and culture, the last trip i went to was san diego, but.., from childhood or as an adult, to family vacation around baja and rosarito beach, yes, the reason why this memory comes to mind is because, this weekend is easter and we will usually go, to the east < east> east spring break, to rosarito baja, i have a bachelor's degree in communications science., because it's an open field, but it's not about.., communication interactive but performing art, telecommunications, entrepreneurship, no, i'm not really unemployed., um, i think owning my business is my dream my dream job to have my own company, um, i want to open something in the telecommunications area, as an enterprise, doing something online services online, i like doing things with my hands, so my next venture would, it would be to create all natural soy candles, something in this area, around a mixture, a mixture of shy and outgoing, because i have to watch people and crowds, and so i usually make a destiny when i, remain reserved or open, i hear like a meditation band or i take a walk, or go for a massage, fair, oh man <laughter> uh probably yesterday or this morning, um, in general, it is about the argument, i'm making myself clear, or i repeat myself twice, no, it usually gets the other person in trouble, mm, i redeemed a service from a mechanic who repaired my transmission, and i had a guarantee, and i wrote to the consumer affairs department, and the guy offered me a part of, the resolution agreement , and i decided to bring him to small claims court, to get a larger amount, and i wish i had, took the offer he gave me, in the middle of, dealing with the third party, which was the consumer affairs division, and therefore i took him to small claims court and i end up losing, the whole settlement and was offered only a very small part, so i wish i had, the higher, street taken as the lower street, i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things., the most difficult decision, i don't know, financially emotional, mm, emotional release of a past relationship, it's the hardest thing that i can do, i'm not gonna say the most difficult thing, but it was a difficult thing., yes it was a relationship of seven years, but this person has moved on., so, they want me to be in their lives., in the hope that , when something goes wrong with my current relationship, we will always have something to fall back on., yeah, it's hard., around an event, something i could erase from my memory, um, i don't know, <laughter> there are a lot of events, that i only delete automatically from my memory, but whatever comes to mind, right, um, probably the death of a relative, to be alone and misinformed, because i didn't know they were so sick, and i didn't know they were numbered around their days, and i would have had more opportunity,, spending and making time with them, better a better connection in the last days, um, it's fair to midland, mm, my immediate i am very close, but distanced not very close, my mother, yeah, she encouraged me,, continue my training, time and again on my, hobbies hope for goals and dreams, she always encourages me,, always stay away and, out there looking for a better opportunity, and she encourages me,, don't be afraid to, explore other ventures, light <laughter> light <laughter>, i felt good., um, a little stressed out, but i'm trying to do this., i'm leaving the stressful environment, um, in the past, about three years ago, um, because i had problems in my learning environment, and i felt <f> i felt, emotionally attacked, yes, i had a problem with a professor who, was just very, i don't know any other personality., and, he almost chased me down the catwalk at school., i felt, i felt like i was in a dishonest environment., i felt, as i wanted you to know change his class and get into another class, but i had no choice but to stay there, and deal with his meanness for the whole semester, i think by finding p t s d, they tried to link depression., no, financial, i'm not capable and i haven't found a consultant who's ready and committed., to work with me and help me with my problems, i think a lot of consultants listen to me., and then they laugh at me, and then they tell me, the opposite of what is, what i'm telling them, mhm, mm, the last time i felt really happy, i really don't know., that's a good question., um, just done what i just want to relax, i was just relaxing and, i don't know, <laughter>, i don't have any best friends, my best qualities that i'm working hard i'm reliable, i'm an excellent friend., um, i'm energized., and i'm a go getter, things i wish i could change myself, likely to be less sensitive, don't take things so personally, and, learn how to help yourself before helping others, no, i have no regrets in my life., if i could have done it differently ten years ago, i probably would have done it., concentrated and studied more, and less, to come out of the house and, hanging with friends, that i have a college education, and i myself am sufficient, and, i can pay my own bills <laughter>, and, i'm alive., goodbye.",0
424,"hi, yes, today is a wonderful day i just do absolutely wonderful, i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to go narrowes when i was sixteen years old, yes, i've only been back once since i left., it's a completely different one, community, when i grew up i am so glad that i grew up there because it was a great feeling of community that i think we're not going to be in los anles <sniffle>, my grandmother died and left property for my father., so we came here to manage their property., it was pretty easy for me to be young., and it was easy to adapt, so i'm pretty good at meeting people, so uh, that's never been a problem that i traveled a lot as a kid, so i was used to moving and going to new places, meeting new people, seeing new things, it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life, oh, one of my best trips i've had was in, nineteen i am with myself, but nineteen sixty four < sniffle> i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland, ohio and i went to an indian reservation, and i got a little note card about the reservation when i came home, i wrote to the reservation and i told them when i came back <ca> went back to school in september i would have to write, uh, a talk rather about what i did in the summer and i told them i wanted to,, to talk about going to the indian reservation and they would send me something and they sent me this, large, kachina indian doll, and that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth it now, if i still had it, i found out like a quarter of a million dollars so, mm, but this is one of the best , i could be a little bit of both., i'm pretty when i have to be, i can be walking because i'm good at meeting people and meeting people, but sometimes i have a little bashful side, a little shy side of me too, so a little bit of both, i studied business administration <ad> administration with a focus on marketing and advertising, well, i really started in computer science, but that was when computer science wasn't what it is today., and around me i liked <li> i was good at it, but it wasn't interaction with people and i love people, so i wanted something that would bring me, interaction with people, so i went into marketing, and i worked for a t v station where i go to school so that in line in marketing advertising fit so, no, now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer i shoot many stars, i shoot on the red carpet, i shoot a lot of special events and everything else people pay me for <laughter>, it's not hard at all, it's my passion, i love it, it's like not working, i'm in my dream job, i just need to get more., jobs <j> jobs pay me well, because there are many times as a photographer that you have to do many things <thin> to get events known for free, so it's a process of building relationships, so i'm still in this process of building relationships, so i can get more paid jobs, but this is my dream job i love, what i do, well, now i'm really back in it i've got it for a while, then i got away from it, but it's meditation, i practice meditation and try to do it twice a day in the morning, and the night before i go to sleep, i work with oprah and deepak chockera and everyone else who provides me with meditation and i use that to, calm down my body, i can generally control my temperament, sometimes i get hired, i think like any other human person <per> being, but i'm working on trying to keep a moderate and moderate, uh temperament in the personality, oh wow we i argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i didn't want to say it hurt her, but it has obviously, and we argued about what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt them mm and maybe what i said did, and that's what the argument started, oh god, i felt terrible because i never intended to hurt my daughter, and i'd never want to hurt her, and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said, so i had to guard my words and watch my thoughts, well, i don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away, so it's just my two daughters here with me, and we have a pretty good relationship you know we're trying to work my daughter is a make up artist and i'm a photographer, so we work a lot together in the industry so, sometimes i think we're too close., we need a little more space, yes, if i say the wrong things <laughter>, no, it's never easy to be a parent, it's a job in work, sometimes making the right decisions, love the feeling of consummation, that you could educate the highest creation on this planet, to be a, uh wonderful and productive person, i'm not as strict as my parents, i give my children a little more freedom to find out who they are, i'm not really religious as they do, but i'm very spiritual, so i raised her differently from myself on the religious tip., and, i'm more i listen to her more i think than what my parents did it was, you were to be seen and not to be heard when i grew up and i let my children's voice hear, one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know that i want to go into details, i feel bad about that night <laughter>, yes, i could have stayed at home <laughter>, wow i'm trying to think about a situation, maybe dealing with how i and my husband divorced i think i could have treated this a little differently, we really loved each other very much and it was just something that made a, an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive, and i think we both could have done better, but i think i've played a part in keeping a lot of drama going., because i was hurt, we broke up and somehow ravaged, because i wanted my child to be raised with her father., so i think it's looking back now, what you know, that the review is twenty two visions., i could have handled things a little better, but what can you do if you knew better?, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, the hardest decision i've ever had to make was that i was on my way to work on a plane when a enrollment consultant had a stroke., wanted to establish a connection, and, to get into the other plane and then go to the hospital and a doctor sat behind me, and he told me, that i couldn't get on the plane, because i could have another stroke that was a tough decision because i was all alone in dallas texas., i didn't mean that i was in there with an employee, but i would be left alone because my employees had to go on., to montgomery alabama, where we went, and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go, but my life was in balance, so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital, but that was a tough one., ugh overwhelmed i mean here i'm on my way to work you know, i flew to different states every week, and uh to help get kids admitted to college and here i'm on my way to work, and i'm on a plane and i feel this, strange feeling coming across the left side of my body, and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get out of the plane, i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment that i did every week, so i knew something was wrong, it was when you came into your life., and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next, so it was very disturbing, very traumatic, and i know you don't know what's happening to you, it's the weirdest thing you're riding to., the hospital in a, medical ambulance, that was a strange experience., yeah, but i'm here., i know i survived, the doctor told me no one survived a stroke on a plane and i survived so, the universe wasn't finished with me yet, you know what that is, sometimes i have a little problem with it., sleep a little sometimes i, i'm wired <laughter> i'm wired just because i'm one of those real energetic people and i have to finish what i was going to do and until i'm done i can't go to sleep, so sometimes it's hard for me to sleep other times i can lie down and just walk, but depends on what's going on in my head, i'm sluggish., probably a little at the edge, but i'm trying to keep a happy personality i'm a real energetic person, so i'm trying, but you know, when you're tired, your body's still talking to you., so, lately i felt really good, except, i ate something., problems because i've had one since i had the stroke, i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke, but i thought it would have gotten a little better now and it's not but i'm so grateful to be alive., that this is really small <mi> small compared to the larger picture and i wasn't, fortunately <for> luckily, i have not lost my facial structure or, you know, my face isn't messed up, how many people are, i can still use my hands, which i can still shoot with my camera, although my left hand in use is diminished., but i can shoot as a photographer with my right hand so i can still do my job, so you know i have to hold a good blow, energy goes on for me to keep being successful for me, no, but i've been through depression., i was beaten unconscious five times when i was a teacher., every ball there was that you could call football baseball basketball names, the ball hit me in my head and i suffered from, how to have sleep apnea and cannot sleep, so often to be hit and knocked unconscious in the head, so, no, just i'm not going to therapy because, i don't have medicine right now, so i can't get therapy that they only offer people with medicine., it's hard to get it < sniffle> and then i don't work < work> yes it sucks i don't work now because i'm still trying to get my disability, so that i, get healthy, because i want to be a fulfilled person and i want to be total and you know the system will take almost two years before i go to a hearing., so that's kind of depressing, to think after all the years i've worked since i was sixteen and it takes me, it's been over a year, it's been a year, i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i will not be hearing by september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i, getting the disability or not, that was very depressing for me because i wonder where i lived from my savings last year, and i brought my daughter through college, she's done and now she has to take care of me and she's still looking for a job, and my life is kind of in the air right now, 'cause i wonder what's next, so i'm just praying for leadership., i feel happy every day i wake up, and i can breathe and i can see, and i can go and i can talk and i can still shoot my photo i'm glad it's just a good thing, to be alive and alive in the present moment, you know what i thought, like what are good regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change here and now, so just go forward live <li>, what advice would i give myself < sniffle> let nothing in your way, you know that you keep a good personality and an energetic mind and just push on, energetically talkative, uh won't take no for an answer uh follow by reliable, good spirited, lovingly give, i'm very proud of it., i could find out my creative side, i was a visual artist, i've never taken an art lesson., i taught art < sniffle> around i was, in my late twenties, before i even discovered that i could draw and paint, i'm a doll collector, i am my creative side, which i am most proud of because it was able to help me., being creative i can do no matter what, even though i was still very sick of a stroke i could still walk, and just go take pictures and that was so, reassuring for my soul, that i am i am glad that i have a creative side and that i have found it and have used it, mhm, uh huh, and that's that it's good bye, see you.",3
425,"yes, i'm fine, i feel a little tired and uh, concerned, um, well, i'm looking for a place to live, and i just don't have a job, so.., things are a little bit, wobbly for me, i'll stay with my son in venice., it's pretty good, but we both have to have our own room, so i'm looking for another place to live., originally from new york, but i've been doing this in california since the early seventies., yeah, that's good., i moved to l a because i had lived in portland oregon and i was tired of the weather up there and my son was down here, so it seemed like a good place., it wasn't too hard for me to meet people right away, and.., i just like it here, so it was easy to connect with people, the weather is <laughter> number one as for most people i love to be near the ocean, um, i like the energy i like that around me likes the artistic culture, mhm, uh good everyone loves traffic i love the weather and hates traffic, so i feel somehow <fee> i feel the same way around, sometimes it is, it will carry a little that it is so busy and the fact that it is so expensive makes it difficult, not as much as i would like if i had more means <fu> more income more means i would travel more, well, most of the time i'm already.., i traveled, let's see, so my longest uh journey, the, was outside the country was to mexico and i traveled, went with a friend to oaxaca, and the whole trip we have about mm i think we, took us about four weeks down and back from the bay area, yeah, that was a fun trip., well, we were working on the census together and she had made this trip a few times and invited me to come with her., of this journey i would say we were in oaxaca for the day of the dead, so it was uh day of the dead with the family in the little village where we lived and, everyone in the village makes an altar in her house uh for her, uh lovers who have died, and, they also decorate clean and decorate the graves, so there were many flowers and it was just neat to be there and celebrate with this family that, uh, well, i studied <studi> i was in the liberal liberal art program, but i didn't stay <st> i just stayed in school for uh in college for a few years, but i was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities, huh my dream job would uh personally support someone,, was in a creative area, and travel to uh and go to events with them, it's hard to break in, i'm starting very minimally with someone i do more., voluntary, work with me and i'm working on building some of my skills so i can do more of it., i'm pretty kind of an introvert, so i know i don't have any trouble meeting people, i don't hold back and.., you know just i'm not shy <sh> how shy at parties i'm going to go upstairs and talk to people, um, but i'm overall kind of introverted so around, i prefer one to one, as, large groups, um, i like to see it uh good i <laughter> i like to see uh improvement shows how on uh h g t v i like to see around, see how to renovate and transform or watch movies, or read, oh and i'm playing a solitaire on my uh ignite my fire, um, i don't usually know that i'm mad until later <laughter> so <laughter> it doesn't really come up dead, and i just tend not to have the kind of life where, um, these situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road, i get annoyed a little, uh, i don't get so upset like when people cut me off or something.., but if people are deliberately rude and you honk for no reason, or.., you know, if they get angry because maybe i did something unintentional that you accidentally cut off and they.., they get really angry then makes me angry in return, hmm <sigh>, um, yeah, like i said, i can't really fight, i had <ha> i was with a friend the other day and around, she got angry with me because she felt like i was correcting her, so it wasn't really an argument, but she, you know that i had said something that, she heard as correction also it was a correction, and she got angry at but, um, well then i felt criticized and i felt vulnerable, it wasn't me, it was pretty uncomfortable., hmm, um, well, i.., in this situation, i didn't have to correct it., um, so sighing , i think this is something i look at in myself is my need to be right., so in general, that's me trying to catch this and, just leave people, make mistakes without <laughter> without telling them about it, mm, hmm, boy, i don't know., that's hard., i don't know that i've had so many problems making decisions., hmm, well, uh.., has been, hard to decide for me, to uh, to let my cat sleep when he was sick, oh it was <wa> and i had to give up a cat to, when i once moved and, and that was also difficult because, to <sigh>, well in the case of the first cat who was sick to, i've decided when the vet, said that he thought it was the human decision, um, and with the cat i didn't have to give up, i, i didn't really decide that i'd move to a place where, where i couldn't take her, and so i, i found someone to take her with me., hmm <sigh>, mm, see, um, that's hard., if i don't really get the deletion from the memory part around, there's nothing i really wish i could erase from my memory, um, try to think of something i did that i, i wish i hadn't., um, oh okay, i remember something was there <wa> <laughter> there was a time when i was, i was in a class at junior college, it was a movie class., and uh, i was the one who was around after we left and made a little film project., um, and we're supposed to put it back in class next week. i was the one who had the movie., and by various, only things that happened in my life right now, i never went back to school, but i never, brought the movie back to them so that all the work they had done, they had to do it again and i still feel bad about it., oh, it's pretty easy, sometimes i wake up, in the early morning hours and and have difficulty sleeping again, but this is not very often, i've been kind of tired and lowly depressed and like not feeling a lot of options, no, yes, i have, well, there have been twice that it once came back in like nineteen seventy, two nineteen < nineteen> yeah around nine nineteen seventy two or three and then around, another time around, oh, so, when would that have been about sixteen years ago?, um, just the feeling that it's not about, you know the feeling that things won't change, if i don't get some help and that if i, i didn't need to know that if i had a few medications that would help me., um, short term, so, i'm not going to therapy now., uh i moved around a lot of finance i wasn't really feeling the need to start thinking it could be a, another option, i feel like therapy can be useful yes, well, when i went to therapy.., it was helpful to have someone who listened and, could also, offer impartial proposals to help me, improve the way i felt, to <sigh>, i was at the beach last weekend., it was a beautiful day and i sat in the sun and, just relaxing and i had my notebook and i did something to write and, i felt very happy and satisfied, i am friendly and compassionate and i am a good listener, and i'm smart and i got uh i have good ideas, to <sigh>, well, i wish that uh, sometimes i wish i was a tougher worker, i'm not really ready to take, low wage jobs, although, i need work so i don't feel like i'm ready to do something., um, and, i wish i could act, i said i had good ideas to have good ideas and i'm good at, uh the beginning, but i'm not really good at following through so, many of these ideas begin, but then, i don't take the distance from them, that's probably what i want to change the most about myself, ten or twenty years ago, i advised myself to go back to school and graduate., ends my training, um, and be ready to, to work, a regular job and to, to start putting money, away for my, pensions, um proud of uh my kids and i'm proud of the friendships i have, and i'm proud that to, what's that?, people who admire me and appreciate my opinion,

kind of person to explore, about psychology, mhm, um, it was one of the classes i received in most excellent, so i decided to change it from the economy psychology, yeah, that's good., yes, no, to own my own record label, um, it's moderately heavy, but you know., take it one day after another, i guess you know, stay concentrated, a little of both, um, i tend to be shy, situations i don't feel comfortable with, or i'm new to, and i'm going to places that make me feel better, yeah, that's good., um, turn the lights down and listen to soft music, mhm, i'm getting better over the years, um, i think i'm, pretty decent now compared to how i was, yes, ma'am., um, due to the lack of i think you could say to control my emotions, i was detained and sent to prison., yeah, that's good., mm, i'm not sure., uh, i don't really have a memory of my toughest decision i've made in my life, it was probably a few days ago, the girl i talked to, and i was arguing about it., lack of communication, and attention, yeah, that's good., frustrated, because.., you know you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect, you know, the same effort, by the other person if you are in a relationship, and at the same time, if you, if you expect sometimes you'll somehow feel for failure so, you know, i guess i'm just learning, there are many situations that i would have dealt with differently., likely, the youngest was uh, i had got into a physical <phy> a physical confrontation, with a prisoner, when i was incarcerated, and the, made me, that sent me to prison, and i had to spend a lot more time with it., and, if i've treated it differently, i probably never would have gone to jail, i probably would have been home much earlier., when i was originally, yeah, that's what happens., mm, there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory, um, likely, my first girlfriend, um, she did something really extreme., it wasn't necessary in my eyes, and it and it cost < co> it could have cost me my life, i think that this is a recurring thought that i wish i could completely erase from my memory, together with the good memories and, um, a few that you have few, fighting, uh, i guess you could say shoot outside, to jump to be robbed, you know the things that inhibit me., i guess to explore, certain areas of life i am not, convenient with so these are the few things that, it would be nice if i could completely erase it., yeah, that's good., to hurt people who didn't have to be hurt, emotional especially around, a few women in my life or in my past, um, probably to bring my mother through certain things she didn't have to go through, together with my close friends and family and, um was once rocky, grow up, but when i got older and matured, and, the certain experiences that i brought by some kind of brought me closer to my family, so now it's pretty decent, it's pretty decent., i'd say my mother, um, yes, my mother., um, well she uh she had her share of experiences, negative and positive, i admire them, the fights she's been through, um, she she uh experienced difficult economic difficulties growing up, but that didn't stop her from raising a son at a young age., graduation of the school get her master, and simply to be a good person in general and she also fought mental health issues as well as, and, probably not the best of the family, that she could have been raised, so she's kind of like an inspiration for me and other people, so i'd say my mother, mm, it's not easy., so yes, it's not easy, i couldn't tell you i've always had sleep problems., usually i just take uh like over the counter sleeping medications or nyquil, but, it makes you sleepy the next morning, so it's like, it's a negative effect really, yeah, that's good., the medications <medi> i don't know anything, i don't know, but i just stopped taking it because i didn't like to feel sleepy, not good at all, um, yes, i mean, i was recently released from prison not too long ago, i'm older., now, and much more responsibility and i feel like my life isn't where it's supposed to be, i feel like i could have made much better decisions in my life., you know, sometimes pity for myself and only, things i've been through and all the nine yards like this, yeah, that's good., it's all right., yeah, that's right., yes, < sniffle> over, two and a half three years ago, , i don't know, i guess the school asked me for help because i started,, understand myself, how my brain works, you know, so i decided to look for help maybe, to improve my life, yes you could say that, yes, i am., yes, yeah, i actually do, i do., mm, better decision making, um, better tools to reflect decisions, how to control, uh, certain situations better yes, um, <sniffle> good, instead of always reacting to emotion, no matter what kind of emotion it is, i'm going back and i'm going to evaluate the situation, you know what is the best way to react, on the situation, and by doing this, it has made me more mature, emotional mature, and only, has a positive result, um, i was lying next to a beautiful woman, who cared for me and the feeling was mutual, so that was probably the most, happy, oh, my god!, spontaneous, um, outward, sometimes a little crazy, um, fun, that's it., nothing, as i said earlier, only, you know you're in pain, the few women who have been my past in my life, and, my friends and family, that's it, shit!, uh school is really important, um, how i wear the people with whom i surround myself, and what i decide to do in my spare time, these are the few things i would say to myself, good music, um, a good game of basketball, to sex, um, i like to go out, i like to go to parties, for social meetings, where everyone is friendly and there is no drama, that's what i like, dance beautiful women, a few drinks, that's all., um, i guess i don't necessarily give up and, only, i don't know., just keep going, not really give up, yeah, that's good., mhm, see you.",20

just want to delete them, but i'm not friends with them anymore, so.., um, my, who is a positive influence, my family is a positive influence <laughter>, and my friends now, oh, it's pretty good., i,

a teenager so, i guess i'm just.., and i was good at it, so i just thought,, i'd continue to study it., for higher at a higher level, yeah, a little bit, but i.., uh, somehow i wanted to, i tried to

guess how, a week ago or so i went to, i went to, where did i go?, i went to this event., in the city center, it was like a, art walk thing, so it was exciting, thank you., oh, it was different., art around galleries and stuff in the city center, they only exhibit their work and, i don't know that it was just interesting to walk around and see all this., um, i think i'm, generous, um, patients, i think, i'm a good friend <laughter>, um, i think i'm working hard., and, what else is it?, yeah, i know., that's it, i think., um, i wish i were more absent, like a more social person, and, um, what else is it?, i don't know and i wish i was like i don't think about, not easy to get around, anger like, you got a temper or something., oh, no, it's not in trouble, it's just, sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people, i'm getting a temper , but i have never got into trouble or, mm, really bad no, um, i can't think <laughter>, um, i guess,, i was in, i was once in an elevator

probably thought i wouldn't try to open it for them, but, yeah, that's good., it was that <laughter>, um, everything i regret i don't really i do well yes i regret about, not, contact like old friends

talk to them a lot, i see them a lot, so, yeah, that's good., mm, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, i don't know <laughter>, i guess.., what i wanted to study at college maybe, it's not that hard, but <laughter> it's a little bit, it's a, big decision, information technology, thank you., yes a little <laughter> not, not so much, but a little, well, i got it when i came into it when i was a teenager so, i guess i'm just.., and i was good at it, so i just thought,, i'd continue to study it., for higher at a higher level, yeah, a little bit, but i.., uh, somehow i wanted to, i tried to make a decision between that and the arts., so, yeah, i'm just glad i did., my dream job <laughter>, uh fashion designer <laughter>, yeah, that's good., how hard work is, um, i don't think it's a hard job <laughter> i like clothes and, tissues and, making such clothes so i don't think it's a hard job, i fall asleep like within five minutes, depending on how tired i am, i am very irritable <laughter> and, uh, yes, i'm very irritable and, not good to be near <laughter> when i am tired, and i can't concentrate, i felt good., thank you., no, um, the last time i felt really happy, mm, i guess how, a week ago or so i went to, i went to, where did i go?, i went to this event., in the city center, it was like a, art walk thing, so it was exciting, thank you., oh, it was different., art around galleries and stuff in the city center, they only exhibit their work and, i don't know that it was just interesting to walk around and see all this., um, i think i'm, generous, um, patients, i think, i'm a good friend <laughter>, um, i think i'm working hard., and, what else is it?, yeah, i know., that's it, i think., um, i wish i were more absent, like a more social person, and, um, what else is it?, i don't know and i wish i was like i don't think about, not easy to get around, anger like, you got a temper or something., oh, no, it's not in trouble, it's just, sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people, i'm getting a temper , but i have never got into trouble or, mm, really bad no, um, i can't think <laughter>, um, i guess,, i was in, i was once in an elevator and this person, as if they were running towards him, and, as if i had tried to think it was her, but i couldn't reach it in time and they liked to start cursing me like i really felt bad because they probably thought i wouldn't try to open it for them, but, yeah, that's good., it was that <laughter>, um, everything i regret i don't really i do well yes i regret about, not, contact like old friends i knew, so i guess, yeah, maybe i'll do that in the future, i know her from primary school, yeah, but we've lost contact over the years., because i changed schools., empty the throat , for now i mean, oh okay um, i don't know, i guess i'd just say, um, learn as much as i can and, i don't just know, don't hold back so much, with how to, how not to be, i think i'd tell myself to be., more outgoing <laughter>, um, i think they'd say the same thing i said earlier that i'm generous., patients, hard work, and, what else did i say?, um, art <laughter> i hope they would say that, <sigh>, mm, i'm

extremely difficult, if i then worked <th> as hard as i do now when i was in school, i would have a p h d in mathematics and physics, it's so hard., outward, it depends on the circumstance, it's not a catch all, depends on the moment, what do i do to relax?, i'm swimming, mhm, swam the last time i swam, um, last friday, yeah mm last friday, what do i do if i'm angry?, mm, swear to myself, pretty good mm, pretty good, takes, takes a lot to get me to express anger, but i do., it was actually in traffic <laughter> so probably two weeks ago, in transport, safe for, , to wait only for the light <l> light, and a guy in a pickup jumps at me, i'm like, so i honk back, and so he didn't like it, and he pulled by the side of me i had no idea what his problem was, and we had a little <li> a few

actions or words, said and done in the past they come, oh just past interpersonal <inter> you know interpersonal reactions with friends or family, you know, it's only gonna happen to you one day, you don't necessarily think about it, for whatever reason, just out of nowhere, it hits you and i'm like oh, why did i say that?, < deep breath>, mm < sigh> a situation, < sigh>, uh woo draws a blank, um, for me, this question has a negative connotation, something that may be negative in my recent past, to <sigh>, what i would have done differently, i don't know., i'm pretty much under control., about my feelings, and take the temperature of the moment and know when and when and when not to react, um, so nothing really comes to mind that i wish i had done differently recently in my past yes, but not recently, oh, i swallow my pride, put my cock between my legs, and say i was wrong to friends, safe, , um, , i contacted him again and then we'll be quick friends again, mhm, <sigh>, <sigh>, you know it's past again, so, not younger past, so, um.., likely, controversies i had with my uh mom, you know, things i said to hurt her, you know, you know when you, hurts those closest to you that sticks, so every time one of these situations you know, so when i am, i think that my emotional i q, grown, so i think, in the past my emotional i q was very attached to the child <laughter>, so, so, i have a good relationship with my mother and my sisters and their families., my father never had a good relationship., i don't know if it's possible he's still alive, but he's in advanced

easy i sleep well every night about <abo> somewhere from at least eight to ten hours per night, <laughter> yeah, oh lethargic for <sigh>, just go through the movements <laughter> you know, um, it's like i'm gonna frame it like this david lynch, who's not necessarily mainstream he's done some, crazy stuff, for movies and t v's, he said the idea of the fear driven artist is b s he says you want to be creative to get a good night's sleep, i like that, mhm, i can't wait to get up and start the day., oh, uh,, when this happens, i always think about it., my behavior and my thinking processes and how to, be more productive, in my life, with what, p eh you mean no i don't think so no i haven't diagnosed <diag> no i haven't diagnosed with any psychological , acronym <laughter>, no, < deep breath>, uh <sigh> this weekend, had a good time with friends we had a big mm, was with friends and we could just talk about it, you know some things and, uh for <fo> conversation lasted for two and a half hour three hours not expected it to happen, it was good to talk like with smart people, informed people open minded people it was a great these types of discussions are rare, it's almost like running <ru> uh the height you get after running, or train you know the endorphins, it was the same., i um, <sigh> either with friends or working on my stuff my writing, or exercise, my height, i wish i were taller, um, i wish,, mm, greater uh physical <phys> just physicality around i wish i hadn't worn glasses, mhm, nothing internal, mm, i'm patient, i've been praised for my patience., by strangers, um, mm, my relationships with my friends and family, i understand that it takes time and energy to get it, and i take time and energy, well, that's a really open general question, of course you know, it's going back to you talking recently you're talking, in the past <pa>, um, i always regret things <th>, i regret, it's a little thing, it's not a big deal., will not be anymore, productive or efficient in using my time every day it is a small thing <laughter>, you know that., i hate waste of time i hate waste of money i hate waste of energy, < deep breath> < sigh>, hm, that's a deep question., <sigh>, i'd say , i was co dependent ten or twenty years ago, i would say to get some help., get some help, you're because you're co, mm k, safe, see you.",1
430,", yeah, sure., i'm fine, thank you., i'm from los closeles, well, you can't beat the weather, ahem and, i just think the familiarity of home makes me feel comfortable here, smog, uh, rudeness even though it's not compared to new york, it's, to <laughter> people can be unbearable if they are rude, not as much as i've wanted it lately, that i've traveled more in the past, but not lately., i just think seeing different places, it's.., new things learn, uh, to find things that are fascinating that culminate in my interest, um, let's see., i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was pretty surprised i know it's still only in america, but i just think about, being from l a, i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger, and more uh like say uh ostentatious than new york, but uh, it was quite an experience and i didn't think any place.., i didn't think any place was more dirty than downtown, but i think times < time> i think < battle> times square has hit us, to mention too many i don't even know where to start, suppose it depends on the situation, um, i like walking i like playing to uh i like reading with my dogs uh, uh everything i think i could just leave sitting still and leave my mind empty i know reading requires some concentration, but uh, you just know i don't have to try too hard to relax., <sigh>, in the past i had problems, but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter>, ah probably arguing with my roommate, but a few days ago, uh, that happens, we're friends uh it's a loving argument < laughter> if you, i met this roommate about six seven years ago., um, somehow moved in the same social circles and just got out, it's cool, i mean, i guess you know how, we argue we sometimes have our differences, but there's not one person i'd rather live with than she's cool, hmm, how much time we have, uh <laughter>, it's just too numerous to mention., i don't know how to answer that., i think i'm gonna break up with a friend i really do., cared for but knowing, knowing that it just wouldn't work.., that was very difficult, only weighed pros and cons and only thought, it just didn't want to work., no matter how much love or care i've brought into the relationship, something was missing, and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and, i just knew it was over., no, so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets, but things you delete from your memory, oh, there's way too many, uh, to mention that i don't know how to answer that., the same girl, i broke up with, she was the friend <laughter> of uh a best friend of mine, they were separated for, several years, and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we're not talking i wish uh my regret is i wish i, i could have done better., <scoff>, um, it's funny to see me getting older, i'm not so close, but i still care about her and i still love her and i think they love me, my mom and dad are both alive mm not much interact i'm very close to my older sister, my older sister, um, she's just, strong no nonsense uh, she's short and yet a fireworks body and i've always liked that on her, she uh, uh, she always makes me feel comfortable i'm like another son to her < laughter> in a way, i suppose it depends on my stress level., um, when i have a lot in my mind, i'm having trouble sleeping and uh other times it just, if i really need to sleep, i just need to listen to the radio reading <lis> uh watch t v and finally i'm going to fall tired falling asleep, crabby, i suppose like everyone else.., tired, listless you know all the normal things i suspect when someone doesn't sleep well, i feel good, mm no, i wouldn't say, i've been, no i didn't, yes, i have, i was probably diagnosed with, about five years ago, i think i always knew there was a problem., i always knew there were a few., i think i always knew before i got treatment that, there was a problem emotional and hmm and many things that are very difficult to explain, and i was tired of feeling that way, so i was looking for help, i just think.., lethargy uh, uh no desire to do something uh motivation was just not there, um, thinking, normal depression typing things uh, um, social <socia> i became socially embarrassed, which was a little different for me because i grew up, you know, pretty talkative <laughter>, i know., i'm sorry to say it again., i think it does., well, um, uh, um, uh,, i think the number one thing and that's what i'm amazed at the temperament that i think i've allowed myself to, uh,, retiring from certain situations, and don't take them so seriously, and do not get so tense or angry, and then react, i think it is, it has calmed me down for the most part, now it's like it's becoming a routine, at first it was very difficult, when i was five years old <laughter>, oh, no, if you're a kid, there's nothing really to do., um, there's nothing that could be sad if you're a kid., my best friend, um, i'm not a fool, i have a dry sense of humor, so you know it., my best friend would probably uh, i think the, the jingle back and forth is that you usually know an insult, but you know that everything is in love., i wish i could be taller., i wish i could be more, inclined to play basketball, so i then go to the n b a and a millionaire i know this is all unrealistic, but only honestly answer, hmm, everything i regret, we didn't ask until i mean, so many don't know where to start, mm, that's a good one., wow, um, i don't know., i know that this is a good one i would have, i would have to think about that i wouldn't answer that uh that's a good one, usually you're asked for, what you'd know, how you'd feel in ten twenty years, when i look back, i don't know what advice i'd give myself., something i really enjoyed, um, i love.., there are several things i like to do around uh you know i uh i enjoy playing basketball i i love to watch i love watching all the sports for this matter, which really brings me joy the last couple of years was killing, become a hobby of me is saving dogs to promote dogs and find them houses uh it's <laughter>, i guess it's become a pretty hobby of mine and uh, sometimes i find lost dogs and i am able to find their owner and sometimes i am not so when i tell you what there is nothing <noth>, to find the owner and i found a owner last week for a little dog that i found there is no greater feeling because the man told me <laughter> the man told me how his around, like his daughter, or just cried when she went to give her that she could give him back, that was cool., i think for someone who hasn't finished high school studying in college, and that's something that, i don't know., i'll take, pride even though i don't show it or talk about it often, <laughter> yeah, you look like my friend rachel, it's funny.,

have <re>, i really think i'm doing it, not very difficult you don't know uh uh at least not for me because i think i have a natural inclination for it, uh and around i connect well with people, i'm more shy, but i'm forced to leave because i know you can't really do anything, to be shy, but if i had a choice, i'd rather, you know., a little more withdrawn <laughter>, until i know i feel like i'm just going the next safe way., so that somehow circumcised with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think, an example, well an example of what exactly you mean, which aspect, all right., good example like uh travel, sometimes you want to go to a certain place, and it's uh, something big is happening there, even though it's a great place, but it's not such a cool place to take as for example as boston i went there a lot, um, now you know that everyone i'm talking to is a little nervous if they should go there <laughter> you know you know it., know you have a great time you know i think it's because of all the interference that just happened somehow you know throws you out of the track a little make you rethink, um, is this a good place to escape at the moment, something like that you know, mhm, mm, uh, i got it., i'm going for a walk, i'm calling a friend we're drinking tea or something., i think i got this under control., mm eh, uh, it was probably something stupid in a work situation that took about five minutes and oh pretty much didn't fight again, i'm not really staying., negative things too much, uh, i don't regret it now., i can't think of anything., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, was uh, do not hire a good friend, for a job that, you know they weren't qualified., that's hard., because you have to tell them it's not the friendship you hire, it's their competence., my father, uh, he's just.., taught me how to, you know, uh overwhelmed, uh trouble when i grew up and how important it was not to give up, uh, and be able to see the bright side of

well, you know, i'm i'm pretty excited when i'm working on something or developing something like that, i tend to overlook the time at some point, but unlike the, you know, when i get out, that's all., all right., i think i'm going to be a little uh, uh try and figure out how i'm going to sleep, you know as soon as i can to make , but to, uh i'm trying not to be uh grumpy or anything i'm just

misread you know if you like anyhow uh, if you look different or in <i> in a different kind of, when another set of things, make you uh excited or you're in a different way to think, people tend to misjudge you, you know, and that really pissed me off someday., but, um, i'm i somehow figured it out and i'm pretty over you know, so i see it as their loss and don't mean you know if they didn't

you do, don't let anyone discourage you., and you'll be fine, and that's how i feel now that it's evolved itself., very proud of the, i think my.., mean my kind of spiritual relationship that you know

433,", yes, i'm doing good., i was born in lynwood, i like all the sights and all the, clothes and shops they have, well, some things all the graffiti around, basically all the wrong, criminal activity and all that bad stuff, i've traveled in the past., i'm not really going out of the state, in principle, budget money money budget expenditure not, limit me to go to another state, i studied automotive engineering, and welding, just a passion for cars since i was small, uh, always in principle, just wanted to work on cars, pretty, yeah, i love working on cars., my dream job would probably be, probably to own my own, a workshop for the repair of motor vehicles or, to own a barber shop, or basically only one, probably a master welder, think of me as a bit out of date, just because i like to have fun uh, just having fun with my friends, able to do everything i ask, basically just smoking on my spare time sometimes or, just lie down and watch a movie that listens to music., basically hip hop music, or maybe, a good comedy movie, uh, pretty easy about that., i don't really know., let go, let my bad side come to my emotions, probably earlier today about with my girlfriend, or woman basically about where we're going to eat, felt desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to eat, because she didn't think so well,, uneasiness, probably just to relax and stay calm, more than just to burst and raise my voice, misconduct in my past basically everything i could have changed, mm to improve myself, basically uh, to do something better in a job that, or maybe, i don't do the job at my biggest, the hardest decision would have to be, uh, to plan a family probably, just basically, to ensure that all situations are where they should be and, talk to my partner about it, when we're really ready to start a family, empty the throat , only basically, the love and bond between me and my wife, um, basically like an accident could be, basically, pretty horrific, terrifying experience, as uh i almost collapsed, the motorway barrier, and the car pulled out and it basically almost landed from a small hill, it was a pretty scary experience, as far as, only uh in a car alone not able to control the vehicle, i just hope i'm okay., it's pretty easy except if i had a good dinner, early in my day would go pretty well to sleep, only restless and just a little more stressed constant things more, i'd be on my heart, lack of energy, perhaps, quite relaxed quiet, not really just the same old, day after day only, try to stay happy and relaxed calm, just try to stay positive energy, no i have not been getting on, no i was not diagnosed with depression, um, earlier today when i had something to eat, it's pretty close., it was good., we talk about a lot of necessary things trying to help each other at any time, my father my sister, my mother, well, my father's been there as long as my mother, they have given me as much as possible from school to, clothes to take me to my sister, she's basically, she graduated from college, so she's like a, a mentor for me looks up to her as far as, graduation of the school and everything trying to go further, you're pretty funny., they're basically just smarter outbursting heads, it seems to be somehow., more advanced thinking, compared to what the children probably think back in old age, they learn things a little faster, uh no not mainly, only things i could have thought i could have done, better or, or just a little different, uh how to build my car differently, um, received, infringements of traffic, basically just uh, i wish i would., by crossings or, i got all the tickets i got on my record., yeah, that's good., i would have basically, right after you try it for the first time not to do it again, so that the same error does not happen, uh, just my person a kind of as far as uh, when i'm angry, only for , find a way to be easier, maybe try, not so much of a negative thinker in times when things become a little more difficult, empty the throat , uh, basically, if someone, accusing you,, misconduct that probably hasn't happened yet, um, basically, when a policeman tells you that you did wrong when you know clearly that you did not do, is something wrong?, probably early this year, in principle, a policeman put me on because he thought i was a drunk driver., i felt really stupid about myself or tried to blame myself for having drunk and smoked when that wasn't the cause, i was just very tired at night it was twelve a m, therefore , i tried, i probably saw a little sleepy, just.., fun cool, a relaxed, good attitude, loyal <l> loyal, um, drifting drifting my two forty s x to spend quality time with my wife and children, um, in principle, everything i did for myself when i graduated from high school so far, thank you., see you.",10
434,", yes, i am., i'm doing very well today., i'm originally from chicago illinois, when i was three, i moved out of here., yes, i'll never go back, family affairs, it depends on what you are in, if you notice, about the fast life and hollywood that doesn't compare it at all, if you're into the cold weather, you'd rather be out there, i like the sun., i'm going to.., my mom and dad broke up., it's okay., i have no idea i was only three when i moved here., i like the sunshine, i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in spring winter, autumn and summer i like the beaches i like hollywood, i like that the sailors are here and, and, <laughter> i love people it's a different kind, i think, l a is a microcosm of the united states, the people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and from all over the world, they come to l a for a better opportunity, so that's what i like about l a, oh, gang violence, < slaughter>, no not really i once traveled to arizona and once to stockton california, and another time to barstow california, but i don't travel much right now especially because of the finances, i studied alcohol and drug counseling, i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that what i should do with my life help people to overcome their addiction, so, um, that was a kind of simple choice i got some advice from people and, i just walked in., just to see what it was, and, i finished school and, have an intership and has been hired and so, i think that's what i'm supposed to do with my life., i'm not working right now, i actually moved away and, i had to take a deep breath, i was married and we had to move because the rent was cheaper, so i had to give up the job., to take this step, but since i came back down, i've been filling out applications and sending resume and trying to get interviews so that i can get back into the consultation, all right., it can sometimes be very difficult because, um, i have a felony uh and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly, and but the normal dopes i can, and then you need to be certified and i'm not yet certified, you need to work a certain amount of hours to be certified before they even allow you to do the test, you need to work a certain amount of hours, so right now, i'm just trying to get interns you know, try to help interns and show people what i can do as a consultant because everything about me isn't seen on my resume and around, yes, they just want people to be certified in order not to be certified in order to experience, and the fact that i have a felony makes it difficult, <laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility, um, or as an author, you know that the <de> depends, that depends on, on persons who are primarily , adaptation of my personality to the people i am around when people are kick then i will be kick when they are standoffish, then i may seem shy, but i'm not shy, i just give them their space and allow them to decide when they want to open, but if people open up right away, i'll open up right away., < slaughter>, i mainly listen to music or, i'll watch youtube, writing poems, um, or i just close my eyes and just lie down and pretend i can sing what i can't., so <laughter> that's, and another thing i do is, i eat ice cream <laughter>, controls my temperament, i'm very good at it it depends on what it is, i have to say that, the last time i lost my temper, it was because i felt it was someone., to scare my mother, so i lost my temper, but ninety nine times from a hundred, i don't lose my temper, i don't like to raise my voice and, i like to be calm and cool and i like that everyone feels comfortable, i don't want anyone to be scared or anything, there's no reason that someone's scared and that we're angry and, you know we're skipping our frustrations with people who had nothing to do with it., i just think that, and i think angry outbursts to be a link around, heart problems and high blood pressure, so i definitely don't want, well, i just told you about um., it was my mother's husband and, to tell you the truth, i could have handled it differently, but when i saw the look in my mom's eyes, i just lost him and i grabbed myself., you know, i told my mother, um, i don't like it., i've seen this guy abuse my mother, but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in her relationship, but when i saw how she was afraid in her eyes, that triggered a part of me., the, i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so, i should have just left., i should have just gone and then gone home and rest and get up the next morning, went to church, but.., yes we had a great time explosion and that caused and that caused a lot of damage for about six to nine months, so, yes, these six nine months i can't go back, yes, well, my brother's in prison, and i haven't seen him in 20 years since he's been there, and my sister moved to chicago for twenty years., thirteen years ago, i haven't seen her since, so i'm just close to my mother., and, my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and, how this is going to go out for me, i just know you know that i have a small family and, i have family in chicago, but, i don't know., to snoop around the side of the family just because.., of what i have seen, and heard, so i just don't want it to happen to me at all, so i just keep my distance, someone who had a positive influence <inf>, i'd say influence in my life, , taught me how to control my temperament and how to express my emotions without expressing my feelings that threaten someone else., and, taught me how, how to monitor my feelings and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and if they are really strong, then i just have to be quiet until, that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not only emotionally, and of course he is, he was the one who encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol consultant to get him, twenty seven years clean and sober at the moment he lived on skid row and he was the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something i'll never forget, feel guilty about, my grandfather, um died in two thousand four, and, at that time i just got out of prison, about two thousand two, i just came out of prison and he came to me and he, told me in so many words that he wouldn't be there that long., but i didn't get it because i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was full of things that i considered more important than that, plus the fact that i didn't understand what he said, but, when he died, i found out he told me., that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go, but i couldn't see it then, and, i feel, i think about it all the time, something i can erase from my memory, what are you doing?, would be the day, my brother i beat my mother again and again that over and over and over again in my head and it's like, this is a memory that i can just walk without, over and over and over again and over again in my head, so yeah on that day that memory right there, i felt contradictory feelings, because on the one hand, on the one hand, my brother protected me, received from beat, and on the other side he hit my mother, so, was somehow in the middle, most nights i have not, i'm going to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably more than likely until seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep, it depends on the environment i'm in when i don't sleep well., i'll be irritable at some point, but it doesn't happen immediately, it depends on my environment and who's around me when there are difficult people who will be a challenge for me and.., when people are loose, no one will know i haven't gotten much sleep., how i've felt lately, i just feel like.., the, it'll be better for me soon., to make some better decisions, to take advantage of the opportunities that come to mind, take advantage of my talents and meet the right people, this can open the right doors for me, so i'm very excited about it, even if it doesn't happen, i'll send out a million resumes, i don't care if i get it., five interviews, i'll never stop because i know that a consultant is my life's job, and, and i'm also meant to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people, to know about me because i had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot of humanity to offer, so it's just a matter of time before, um, that the public is exposed to what i've collected, my behavior i'm gentler, to laugh more humorous, i let a lot of things go that i'm always just, let me check it out., and angry me and things i can't control, like trying to control people or trying to make sure people don't betray me and, you just can't control me thinking i'm mentally mature., and psychologically eh, and the, the acquisition of a sense of humor was a big breakthrough for me, so, i know that my thoughts have changed and my thoughts have changed my behavior, i still have to monitor it., my thoughts and behavior i still have to monitor, but overall i am, you know., back then, i tolerated myself., actually like me and around it will erhove <beh> behoove you, the same way to feel, no, i didn't., no, last time i felt happy was last night because the lakers won the basketball game, < slaughter>, yeah, that's good., my best friend would describe me, he calls me the truth, because i always tell the truth and people try to hide things and i always reveal it, they can't hide it from me around i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it, and i see things days and months before they start to happen, i know human behavior when i see it, and i sniff it out really well and it's just a gift that was given to me so that he calls me the truth because of how i interact with people and how people, to get clean with me, because when they look at me, they know that i see through them, as i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and, yes, that's why he calls me the truth <laughter>, um, i wish i never had, i wish i'd never gone to jail., i wish,, that i could change, all right., my economic status my employment status, and, my teeth, which is like a problem area for me, i have a lot, stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't care about my teeth and now that i have to be, um, trust about myself as i can be you know it always comes, i wonder if they look at my teeth, i wonder if they look at my teeth, i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are, but in the back of my mind there are those thoughts that say, look at my teeth, so i would really, to change that and i would change my height, i think i'd like to be, at least thirty five pounds heavier, but i'm working on it., twenty years ago, which would make me eighteen, i would have had a big time around high school basketball players for fremont high school at that time and i had colleges coming to see me and i would have given myself the opportunity, was away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i, could have played for the lakers last night, but, hey, i am very proud of the fact that, you know what i'm most proud of my mother?, really, really, um, she graduated from school., she had a full time job, a full time job, where she woke up., five o'clock in the morning, go to work, at three thirty of her job to go straight to college leaving college at nine o'clock a night she does this five days a week, and still had the power to keep them on the list of deans and presidents, so that all this, you know when they say , that older people can't do things, i just think that this rumor scatters around, and she recently got her around license as an evangelist in the church so, i'm just very proud of it and.., your life influenced people, in a positive way so yeah my mother, <laughter> okay thanks, goodbye.",2

the room, that you have to solve something, i felt overwhelmed i had already solved it i was just waiting for, a check you know, it's not my control, but i've already made the right arrangements and she bugs me about it and it's like, you imagine an argument that you know a storm in a glass of water., it's like mhm., all right., there are some of them, but not so recently, because i'm more, try to get my life together, but the decisions i made in the past, like early school leaving and other different things to do, mm, don't blame so much because, not really, not that i could think directly of my head, the toughest decision, oh, it's just not on my head right now, an event, the only things i remember are when i'm black or other things like that i don't remember., but, not anything like a

like having a good relationship with my family., all right., my mom and dad they always work hard they always did what they had to do to pay the bills, that's why sometimes i'm running around as you know trying to do everything, but done properly don't try to take the easy way out, it's a little hard because it's mostly here in los angeles there's a lot, different things you could get into are not so positive, and it's hard to focus on you knowing the right things to stay, well, usually i just knock out, it's not that hard, it's like it takes me half an hour or fifteen minutes, but.., sometimes i can't even wake up with the alarm., you need to wake me up, you know my girl needs to wake me up, even if the alarm starts., hard so you know i just knock out, i get a little bit either i'm angry or i don't feel good and i'm not filled with energy, but i still need to know that i have to do something to keep going through it., i was good i felt good you know, was a little restless, but i didn't have to do that much, all i know is you made me do it no matter how i feel., no, nothing unusual, no, no, the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know, going with a, going out have some fun and you know that i was drinking and just relaxing, and winding <win>, mhm, my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either outside or at home just relax, but nothing else you know just be able to relax and relax with it you either go somewhere to a beautiful place or stay at home, but without any calls or interruptions you know only to be able to turn off the phone and turn everything off just, with her to do the other different things, mhm, uh like an outgoing guy you know very socially, but at the same time i'm reserved depending on how i feel with people, you need to know, build trust or feel comfortable with them, oh, i'm changing a lot you know like, uh my temper and various things drink things i am, change a little different things so i could get more different things done, oh, there are several, but mostly uh, when i come from mexico, they want you to be different down there, it feels like silly because i went to a store where i was dressed regularly., and i told them i wanted to buy something and then they said that, that i don't belong there and i and as soon as they saw my credit card, they somehow changed perspective because they saw the wells fargo logo that they know i was american, but they thought it was the way you know it., it was <wa> it made me feel ridiculous because you're going to a place and you've got the money you're asking for something, you're going to ask for something because you don't just have to waste it <wa> kill their time, just because they saw a card logo, that's how they know you, it was just ridiculous for me, no, basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school, and you don't know that you know you're trying to control my temper and do different things, because if i knew what i know now, it would be different., well, i ran away, but i went back to school and i know i got high school., and right now i'm in the process of doing other things so now is

good in controlling my emotions, oh, god.., i wouldn't say it was a real argument, it was more like a what just a, discussion, perhaps, on, finance, perhaps, money, um, just.., oh just a little irritable <laughter>, but not really, not really strong emotional, uh, wow gosh i <laughter>, i can't think of anything right now, so let's skip this., um, mm maybe uh, eating eat more junk food than i admit,, or, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, uh, maybe.., buying a house <h> buying a house, or remodeling of the house, spending for, uh, it was.., i felt it was time to go on with my life and uh to buy a place for myself so i could be self sufficient and independent, , yes very happy, thank you., uh an event i could delete from my uh, when i was around yeah when i was a student when i was teaching for a year and trying to get my teaching skills and discovered that i never enjoyed it, i want to delete nineteen eighty three all year long, it brought terrible <laughter> it only brings back <laughter> terrible memories of what i've been through when i was taught studently and discovered that, uh,, teaching k 12 was not for me, i studied my main subject was spanish and linguistics, i was very good at foreign languages and i thought, um, i enjoyed taking them and i just had a good time to take foreign language and uh, i got good grades, so i thought maybe that's what i should go in, foreign languages, uh i taught < teachi> i was an adult ed teacher teaching english as a second language for thirty years and i just recently uh decided to retire uh, um, i have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters my father died in two thousand eight and around, my relationship with my father was not as good as with my other family members., yeah, that's good., but on the all around we have pretty good relationship with the rest of my family now, i don't have any problems., if i don't sleep well, maybe i'm in bed, and you know.., to mess up the sheets, but that doesn't happen too often., oh pretty good, i think i felt pretty good no big health problems or anything, no, uh last time i was really happy, uh probably uh as spring break it came to uh vacation time and it was time, uh < laughter> go on our trip, uh yeah it was around it was a week trip to the central coast to uh cambria and pismo beach and santa ynez, it was just a nice holiday on the uh < laughter> hotel lawn and garden drinking wine, and uh enjoy various sights and eat good food and <laughter>, and buy wine to fill up our dwindling supply at home, <laughter>thank you, i think she'd call me.., eh, cute and sweet and around, motivated and uh just a nice person, oh, i'd say sometimes i wouldn't mind being a little further, i guess., i tend to be more reserved, so i wouldn't mind going to strangers and things, but, mm, really bad about me, uh let's see, probably when i betray a trust with some friends of mine when i recorded them when i sing them christmas carols and i, i played it with some other people and they found out and they really put a debt trip on me for doing that,, yes, but it was all solved in the end that we all became <laughter> we were all <laughter> it was just a bad misunderstanding from my side, but it worked out well., yeah, that's good., probably with, did what i did from <laughter> it played with other people, uh, what advice would i give myself?, 10 or 20 years ago, uh don't give up just keep uh <laughter> continue to track what you want and uh never give up , see it as a, and as disappointment, if nothing <noth> if it doesn't work, um, i'm a good listener, i'm a, i'm a motivated person, i'm hard working i'm conscientious i'm caring, um, i'm usually a pretty happy type of person, recently something, what i really enjoyed, uh, go to uh go to the festival of books at u s c, this weekend, uh yeah uh the festival of books is a it's a festival where they all have these uh book mm authors <auth> authors and, they have demonstrations <dem> food demonstrations and seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and uh, there's a lot to eat and.., and a lot of uh writers sign books and things, it's a great event for <laughter> just to get out <laughter> and it was nice weather, so it was nice to be out there, mhm, yes, i really enjoyed that especially the food, thank you., very proud of the, very proud of uh probably uh, successful in my work uh in my life in my marriage and, simply yes, just basically to be happy with myself, oh, you're welcome., see you.",0
438,", yes, i'm doing pretty well., i was born and raised here in los engeles, <sigh>to the weather, um, would be the number one i like also the varied uh, cultures, i like the fact that there are a lot of different things you can do here., and there is a lot of opportunity here not only for me, but for my children, and i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career in school, to learn about different people, transport the cost of living, um, sometimes i think it's too big, and i think the transport system as far as the bus and trains around is long overdue, they have to renovate it or, you know, add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around by public transport, i travel when i'm a little here and there i haven't been abroad yet, which is a destination of mine in the next few years, so i just traveled inland i tried to take at least one trip a year somewhere, i like the fact of getting on the plane and going places that go especially somewhere i've never been., and learn about the place you know like so when i'm going to d c i'm really looking forward to it because there's a historic city, you know things like that, my last trip would have been d c < laughter> last year., i went to a friend and i stayed over, three < thr> i think three to four days, and i need to see the capitol, he showed me everything you know about historical sights and sites, the white house., the capitol building around i have a lot of other uh government buildings to see, and it was a good experience the irony was that i had to fly to nine eleven and that had me a little restless, but once i was on the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes, but i miss the trip and i look forward to returning, to attend my girlfriend's wedding, she had a goal wedding in hawaii., um, in fact, maui, that was actually two three three years ago three years ago, in august and around, i've been trying to get back, since then, and i want my children and, i just love it there and i'm really looking forward to moving there for a day, i have three sons at thirteen year old twins, boys and my youngest is also a boy, he's eight, they have all birthdays in june the twins are on the ninth of june and my baby is on the fourth of june and so they are only a few days apart, but, 5 years apart technical, and they're just super super, typical boys everywhere active hormones puberty around so it is actually an interesting time because you know that the two older boys go through puberty, they're teenage years, about my youngest, um, still trying to figure out some things for yourself you do that transition period from eight to nine years old, so he'll be nine in june and then my elder will be fourteen, so it's a challenging time for me too., only the joy of seeing what you consider to be parents every day and seeing how, only with love and care and around, the right and you know, well i can't say right development, but only with, you know love and care as a baby grows to a toddler in, you know a young boy to a teenager and then to a young man and so that experience alone has rewarded yourself just to see my sons grow up and go through these different stages, and see how they developed, and you know,, to see some of the things they're going through now that so remind me of my teenage years, and it's only very rewarding and actually i'm looking forward to being a foster parent later on when they're older and off to college because i really love and give children back, um, there's probably a few things, but i'd just say, um, for me as a lone parent is to the financial, well, i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them to bear the main burden of the responsibility of just child upbringing, um, you know the, just the everyday things of what you have to do with the, sometimes, when you're just tired, you don't want to be disturbed or you try to do things for yourself., you need to be reminded that oh okay i need to cook, or i need to pick up my son or i need to take him to the baseball exercise., this is going to go over here, this is moody, and you know that kind of challenge., as well as the finances and you know that you know that you are able to eat on the table you pay your rent and, you know, day after day, and these are the two that are probably the hardest things i'm dealing with., well, i take it day after day, i just lay one foot in front of the other and.., i am extremely spiritual, so i rely on god and, pray and meditate a lot, um, when i see that i need some help when, you know i'm i'm not up asking for help, so sometimes when i reach out to people or, you know what other resources are out there to help me, you know that i'm trying to do that, and so for me now my biggest challenge is just, i try to go back to school to get myself into a better economic situation so that i can continue to care for them., to i studied communication actually i was a major in journalism public relations with a minor in sociology, and now i'm studying business <laughter>, i just thought you knew., there would be more opportunities for me with the economy, up to jobs., and then i know you have the desire to go to graduate school so i thought in the long run it was a better, it would put me in a better position to give me more opportunities., with the communication it is a little limited and especially as you get older around the fields of t v reporting and things like this around, are somehow, will be, you know, more difficult to get, so i just thought i was going into something more realistic, and, you know, but i like both areas that i really like that i'm writing by reading how you can say and we'll see,, around <laughter> a couple probably, but i'd say at the end, would travel like works like a travel writer to go to different destinations, to try out different foods to write about different people, cultures around, learn and live you know uh about the different people and cultures live < l> live under <am> under the, you know the people there and.., to be interactive with the children and something like that, so i hope to be able to do that one day, but yes to, it would be something in this direction and then the relapse would be a consultant to social workers something in this area., if i could cover all three, i hope i can do that, this is actually a difficult question, probably because i grew up very shy at first., and not as shy as i am now reserved, um, but not conservative, but only reserved and you know when i go somewhere i am, check everything that everyone else out, and then once i'm comfortable or acclimatized the situation then i'm like okay you know that i warm up to the situation or people, but i'm also friendly i can speak very friendly and starting i like, you know., i seem like a chatter box but i'm not really that normal when i'm in a big room with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can, to bind to one or two persons and, you know, you'll be kind to them, but i overall i'm an open friendly person, < slaughter>, um, for me, it could be something as simple as undressing., all electronics and just sit for a few moments, meditate, to pray or read a good spiritual scripture, um, if i am able to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, um, you know things that will, i like the physical part of it i like massages things that really solve tension, um, and if not, then just as i said, just sit at home reading and praying or, i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sitting on the beach, i like <li> even maybe, go and eat alone or a mani pedi or, maybe go shopping windows you know things like that, mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a problem with the temperament, as i am only i am impatient, unfortunately many times with people and you know situations, so i can just get really irritable or irritable, um, quite excited especially when it's the time of the month for me i'm just, lose patience outside of it, i'm actually pretty good i'm trying, very much you know where i'm at and, be very patient with people, especially if i could see that the person is, as if they were a new <n> a new cashier person at the counter or cashier i try to be, i try to be patient and understanding, 'cause i'd want you to know if i was, i'd want someone to extend that to me., you know, with my kids sometimes you know that it's, it works both way once it's the time of the month, i'm just like ugh just leave me alone, um, or i could have a short temperament or a short fuse, so i'm aware i'm trying to be, conscious and trying to monitor it, but you know how everyone i am human and there are times or i have my days or moments in which i could just go like ugh and, just lose it., to <sigh>, well, i didn't really have any argument in itself, but there was an ongoing thing with american express, so i'd say, because there is no personal, contact, but a company i anyway we, it was really an argument, but i had a few problems with american express, which i had to call about on saturday, and i stopped thinking that i didn't get that., answer i expected and so i would get all the contact the call was just back and forth, very frustrating and i was upset and you know that the representative tried to persuade me, then i tried to persuade her., so you know, i don't know if you'd consider that an argument, but i'd definitely say that's the last time you know., i just somehow reached my boiling point., to say the least and was really excited and, oh, that <th> that was the next thing you know to make an argument and then i had to call back this morning that you don't really escalate to an argument, but it was a tense exchange for one or two minutes, probably the latest contact and that would have been the one on saturday with american express, um, or actually it was on sunday yeah and around, i know, the person tried to help me, but you know if you're constantly being told different things and i had to call about five or six times about the same situation, and it will not be solved, it will only lead you there so, um, i kept raising my voice and saying that i shouldn't have had things., and easy was more so allowed me to lose control of the contact i really like to feel it in control of the contact, and so around it just took me there my blood pressure was raised, excuse me, and that was just some sort of chaos for a while, for about thirty minutes or an hour after., just irritable and excited and excited and so i always try to know you, go back and, to draw from them, and, you know, do my own sense of feedback and, see how i could know how to treat things differently, but that's one i definitely wish i had my cool and was more level headed and, and not really raised my voice and you know to be more polite, <sigh>, mm, well, i probably had a couple but < clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they were probably my twins they were probably about two, and i was back in a situation with her father and became pregnant and around, it was just not a good time, and he pretty much knew you wasn't comfortable with me another kid at the time, and around me was not comfortable, with another child either, but wanted to keep the baby, but, he put me under so much stress, and you know, i kind of wanted to say, really pushed me to end the pregnancy., and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy the child i'm thinking about, that the baby or what would have been i could not try to keep anger or resentment against him or anyone about it, but i know deep inside secretly when i had it to do everything again, i just would have kept the baby and moved forward, so that would've been it., probably the hardest especially emotional i could deal with a lot and i've dealt with a lot you know to, you're unemployed, or you know a lot of financial problems, but that was the hardest thing for me., thank you., no, mm, no, okay, you know., i was released in december, so i've been all the time, try to do things you know to get back on my feet, so that was a little hard i had to face a lot of challenges, and dealing with it and problems with child support and trying to find another job and go back to school, so i mean my area of emotions were just that a range and a very good friend of mine now that we both started, you know, in the same place, about five years ago, she was able to move forward and continue with her life, and now she's graduating., next month of u s c with her master in social work, so i feel a little envious of it and i have been for as last year, but in more recent times, although i'm very happy for them you know, and she's a good person and she deserves it, but of course deep inside i wish it was me, so that somehow also has disturbed me, all right., i am really good with people i communicate well, i like to talk, i'm really good with kids, so i'd like to teach or be a consultant around, although i didn't really tap it, i know i'm a very creative person, um, i know i write pretty well, i might be a creative writer, but i know i'm very creative, so, when i have the opportunity, i know that i could tap that and develop these skills like songwriting for fiction writing., um, but probably like interior decoration, all artistic just everything because i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays, um, i'm not a big fashion buff, but i love fashion and make up and so, i think that would be my strengths, and i would only know people i know that i would make a great consultant who my friends come to me, all the time i have a good ear to listen to, i'm a great mediator and i know how to do it because i've been through a lot., and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that actually completed s c, but to, i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has, to do with you know with older parents themselves or how i grew up or i had very traditional southern parents, who has instilled many great values in me, or whether it has something to do with my astrological sign, i am a pisces, but i'm, really good with people only you know time period, you know, like i said, i have my moments, but i know if it's something i could go into and develop that i would do well., mm not really, i wish i'd waited for me to get married before i had children looking for another partner., um, and i say that i'm my son's father is great, but to, a great father for my children, but not so much as a partner for me, we're not together, we haven't been together for years, but, i'm just saying, overall, i think, uh, i had, yeah i think i'd say if i could let myself be traced back saying not to finish school if i had and couldn't follow my dreams and goals and do things as i somehow planned first and, i think this is, that i would honestly be the one thing i could say i'm not sorry to follow my goals and finish school on time and follow what i really wanted to do, stay focused and finish school and choose a career path and, stay with it and stay motivated and let nothing or anyone deter you, mm, i think i'm pretty stable and consistent just, with overall i think about how i faced adversity as i face < f> i, face things you know to, i'm a pretty dedicated person i'm trying to tell you when i say imma do something i'm trying to keep it i'm a very loyal friend, i'm proud to have raised my children solo., all right., thank you., see you.",2
439,", yes, i'm fine., i am born of los engles and in los engles, yes, they have many places to visit many people to see many things., smog, uh the environment has grown over the years uh , i've been nineteen and fifty two., i was born here in los angeles and see such changes as far as environment with smog, and, mm basically it is the, i was in several places in the united states yes, uh try different kind of cuisine uh i like going to the museum like the historical i am a historical buff i, um, i'm going somewhere else than where i've been all my life., let me start with uh, i had never been to boston before and when i left i could look at the historic uh the buildings and i went to uh, i saw it., um, anyway the lake charles and the and the boats and so and it was just it was a good experience and around, there's another place where i went to a ferry and it and i got my mind emptied on it around, my god!, i can't imagine it right now., but unlike the new orleans i was at the new orleans, i didn't go to the mardi grass, it's just, i don't like to go and it uh to mardi grass if they have a lot, guys, i was just in a low season., i enjoyed this and i was on atlanta georgia, and i made a cruise, i went to the caribbeans and took the mexico cruise., uh i my next cruise i'd like to go is alaska because i'm able to see uh certain areas we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environment, i'm going out., i have no problem eating alone., i have no problem meeting people., i'm just shy of talking to a stranger <laughter>, oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like it, competitions i'm a person who, loves to try in a lot of competitions and i have been very successful since i was a child, i've won a lot of competitions and, uh in the evening time uh i find like an hour of time and i just go online and just, i'm so good at it that i know exactly the right time to even enter it. normally i try to enter it before midnight when everyone else is asleep, so it was successful for me., um, married and my children have <laughter>, mm, i have a 27 year old son and i have a thirty one year old son, both of them, uh, one of them is married, the other is not, and i became a grandmother not too long ago, so i have a grandson, and uh my uh son he uh works for the county los engeles as a promotion < co> a property promotion promotion examiner, and the other is a computer engineer, so, and i've been married for thirty three years, and, basically uh marriage pretty strong, you know what, when you build a foundation with your children, and have a good relationship with them, and talk to them and find out what's going on., and tell them you love them, uh, son, i taught them all the time when they left the door, i love you., and even today, when they call me and hang up, they say, mom, i love you., you always have to make them feel good when they leave the door., that you'll take care of me, and i've never had to go to any prison to get her out, i mean, boys will be boys, but i never had a problem., as far as they are in any serious trouble, and i'm very proud that especially with boys i don't know how it might have been a little different with a girl, but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law, uh the best thing is to see them grow and themselves become parents and see what they basically learn from you, and i watched my son as i said i was just a recent grandmother watching him deal with his son., and it seems that he has learned a lot from his foundation that he has learned at home., about dealing with his son to be responsible to go to work every day, and he knows that hey, i have a wife, i have a son, and it's my job to make sure i keep a roof over her heads., so it pays off, and i basically he treats her well, around my mother was tougher on me <laughter> uh my parents around, for some unknown reason i think because i'm my sister and i are the girls they were not strict on the boys, but they were tougher on the girls, so they didn't let us go to many places and then my parents weren't type, who like to travel, and i used to look at them and said no i won't be like them i'll travel i won't just stay home i mean, i mean, i mean, there's nothing wrong with them because they, love found at home <laughter> and did things at home, but she never really traveled anywhere and my mother used her fear of airplanes for a, and i tried to get her on a plane and go somewhere and she said, oh i'm going here, i'm going there, but she never died, that she never did to make a trip, so i made it up to her., and uh i want to do something different and that's more to travel than and more to be out there, i was more of a social butterfly, my mother wasn't a social butterfly., so i made it up to you., i think before i speak, and then i'm the kind of person also around, i accept other people's feelings before i.., cover up the wrong thing i'm trying to, uh analyze the situation first, before <bef> because sometimes you can open your <yo> mouth too soon and you can stick yourself into something you might not be able to get out of, um, it's probably something about my husband that he did, oh he, i know what it was, it's about, uh, good probably about some new construction that my husband is working on at our house., we had a disagreement about that., men have their own kind of things to do and to, i had told him not to have a certain uh, eh person to work at our house, but because of the personal relationship he has with that person, he went on, and now he sees all the falls, and he didn't listen, and i didn't say i told you., but i guess he can see by my facial expression, i told him i said you were losing money., and it became one problem at a time, so now all the building is in the air because he knows he's done wrong., and uh but he doesn't want the fact that he knows well, but he doesn't really want the fact, so he says look it's my project no it's our project, this is one of the biggest arguments we have now., that i can imagine that this is new, i felt that he didn't really listen to me., and he looked more like that uh a cheaper economic way that he can do that without going through the right ways because i told him that to, you need to do your research, i'm the kind of person i do my research before i jump into something i'm trying to do my i's and cross my t's, but my husband he's not so he likes oh i can do this person this project for x amount of money, and he's a good friend of mine, so i don't care that he's licensed., he doesn't look at all the stuff he is, he just jumps in <laughter>, what cost him some extra money unnecessary money he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money, and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because, it was just wasted money that we could have saved because in the end we're all doing the same thing again, and it didn't make sense, um, i'm retired early., to i was very happy at the age of fifty i retired two thousand and two i worked for the state of california, to be an invalid analyst and what happened, i was able to get the reason why i could retire so early because i had worked since i was eighteen, and i had as thirty and a half years of service, and what was so nice about it that only took <n> to get west in as ten years in my health insurance, so i was able to get full health insurance, but the only thing about it when you retired was i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg, but, we have an excellent pension system and since i have worked with them for so long, um, i didn't get the full percentage i should have stayed until i was fifty five, but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount, but that's okay., i found myself doing a small part time job., because of the economic reason and then i have wounditis <laughter> so around, i think that was the kind of mistake i should have waited until i was fifty five, but i see it now as far as the health insurance that i really benefited because the rising cost of health insurance has increased, and i don't pay very little money, so i think about uh negates the uh the money i get, um, let me see the most difficult thing, it's probably when my mother died because i'm not used to someone dying., and my mother around, died in ninety nine of uh non hodgkin lymphoma, and, i'm packing her funeral around my brother and sister, we'd never see anyone in the face who dies., or put together a funeral and all responsibility <responsi> because i am the oldest it was placed in me, and i'm like oh my god what do i , and so around me was kind of like left out there trying to find her insurance policy because i had asked her to make sure she'd fix everything., and she never came to her, so the hardest thing was to go through her house and try to get all that stuff together and find things., you know, i keep my things organized myself, but.. for some unknown reason, she didn't organize hers and.., i think that was the hardest thing and knowing how much i had to pay because i had to come out of my pocket on some of my things, and unfortunately my mother <laughter> this is interesting, she had a little barrel insurance, but she had a million dollars accident insurance, and of course she didn't die with an accident she had., a medical condition, so that was something, so we had to pay for everything, yeah, it was, but.., and now i can with i i around < laughter> that will sound strange, but to, since i learned from it, so i made it available for my children, that my husband and i met, and we always land our insurance uh police not insurance policy but um, what do you call that?, barrel insurance we had that, and it just we have it for mm many many years, so it's almost paid, but ten years it will pay for everything around the plot and everything, and uh another thing i did i even wrote my own obituary i know that sounds strange, so, my son, i don't want them to go through anything., i went through it., and my husband agreed that we agreed on one thing., and, he said he doesn't want anyone having any problems uh people coming and telling them what to do it's already written we have a living trust, i mean, it's nothing they can do but make a call., and that's it., i have no problem sleeping i sleep very well <laughter>, pretty good, um, i was a little tired, but this is just because of the physical condition around i have found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d deficiency, so it is more physical, but not in the mental, um, exercise walking more so, no, not really., no, no, i'm basically happy all the time i'm mm more, so i make other people happy i get more phone calls from people want inspiration about things uh, when they have projects they work on and i try to encourage them, uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know, hey i really appreciate your input around, thank you and then i'll track them and see how they're doing., oh uh resource person i was around, described as a resource person from my superior, to my friends because i'm the kind of person i'm researching everything i'm getting into., i just don't dive into any situation, i'm trying to search for information uh, some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also back to the old school as well as find this place, i mean, i've googled the card but also i love the thomas brother i'll never give up my thomas brothers card, yellow pages would be surprised, i don't give up my yellow pages, so there are certain little things i don't really let go, i know we have technology, but, sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can find a lot of things., that although technology exists <gi> you have it right on your finger, but you can find things, and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to look for things, and i get this because i like to look for things and find it, and that gives me satisfaction, uh, i wish i could.., stop, stop and stop my weight <laughter> i will lose weight, i will go on this great diet before the summer and, and then until christmas i am one that they call a jo yo weight problem, and when i can stop bingling and make food my friend, um, i think this is just a nervous disorder that i just like to eat and to, but also i don't like being overweight because i have a lot of beautiful clothes at home, and i can't do it on now so, i know i say when i go to this binge and try to lose weight for summer time, so i get into these some beautiful clothes, so it's mm mostly uh, not happy with my weight, that's it, i'm sorry i didn't hear you., um, no, not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose weight, but i can't regret it to keep it i fall back on putting the weight back on, um, let's see ten or twenty years ago, mm, i would have saved a little more money before i retired. <laughter> and uh uh basically around, put more money away before i retire, instead of retiring too early, the proudest of my life, um, meeting with many people who came in my life, uh i have good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends i went to primary school, and in very rare you could find someone can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends that we were in a sorority together, went together to college, lived in the same neighborhood and fact that we just had to good all of us had our sixty years of birthday and our high school, group we together a 60 year birthday meeting, and here all fifteen of us with the exception of one that we all live and are healthy and we stay in touch, so i think uh, it basically holds the same friends i think anyway we'll probably survive each other <laughter>, all right., you're welcome., see you.",1
440,", yes, i'm fine, thank you., i was born in east los angeles., and, yes, to explore the freedom to outdoors, and with different, weather temperature < temp> you know with weather < clears throat>, temperature, and climate for skiing or, to the beach maybe on the same day, i like that., um, mm i probably think the overcrowding, and the smog, mm not often, but i have, meeting with other people and learning about their environment and cultures, the last trip i made outside of here was to italy., and, that was my second time to be there, and, i enjoyed it more this time., because, i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and.., and i was better prepared, for, italians and their culture i felt, i wasn't like you know i was better prepared, i thought, for this trip, <freezes the neck>, that would be, to be in the country and see a very small house, in the middle of, hectares and hectares and hectares of grapes were only, magnificent, human development, i didn't decide to do that., started the school with the intention of being a lactation consultant, and i went to a program, in which you get a degree as well as your license to become a lactation consultant, and through the process i learned that i had to do a long internship without paying and at the time <t> and i miss, i had one family, so i had to make another career choice fast, and so the college offered, human development as an important, and i.., just walked right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already purchased, on this particular important and, and i'm happy with it, currently no i stay at home i have a little, well, he's not so small that i'm ready to get back to work., um, in the meantime i design jewelry, well, i've got three, children around i have an almost four year old and then i have two older children, seventeen and twenty three, no, so that your children are the love of them and for them unconditionally, all the steps they go through are stages all the time., for each age < slaughter>, and then everyone in my household is different because they are different ages, so, i think i'm probably more in line with these different levels, that's why it drives me crazy., um, and i think my parents were parents back when my parents were,, it was just like, you know she's fed, she's dressed., she has a house, i mean a roof over her head, and we do it great as parents and we love them and so, it wasn't about there wasn't too much i felt the parents thought about, that in terms of education in this way and as you know today, there are books for every age, every year month, you know, throws out and rounds out. , so i think it's different in this way, monstrous, very close, empty the throat , outward, mm, i don't feel uninhibited., i, feel a little, you know, confident to talk to people, i'll probably talk., more than i have to < laughter>, lets the neck clear let the neck open let the neck open let the neck open , i'm designing jewelry, i'm doing it to relax., i'm pretty good at it., well, i think i.., try not to, not to feel or let others know what my feelings are, when i'm angry, that's not good., because if i don't do anything with them, i know it'll come out sometime., and, yes, it is., this is something i have to work on., like training or something like that, it was my husband and it was about, um, he asked me if i ever thought of cheating in our marriage, of him, uh really tired to talk about the same subject, um, now it came from < f> from, a client of my husband, who is a woman, and she told him that she had cheated on her husband for a year because she had upset him., many things, and around <free throat>, and so he took this information and came home, and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what, think of fraud and, he knows i upset him., and that made me feel like it made me cheat or thought about cheating, < emptied the throat> and around <sigh>, we've talked a lot., and uh i don't just mean that, but, i don't just know about fraud in general, and all the more so i just said what i, usually says that i don't, um, and that i, have thought about it when we were together for the first time, and uh but it was just a thought, and, um, and then his answer was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell each other, and that just kind of, <sigh> i guess i'm irritated i was really disturbed by that, and i was just thinking you know we're having this conversation again., and why do we have this conversation <laughter>, you are the one who cheats and so it is, the, went to, that.., argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> screaming i mean it was part entertainment and part sms, to <sigh>, don't speak, <laughter> at all, to <sigh>, mm, almost every situation that affects my children and when i screamed, because i really don't like, when i got to the point where i screamed more, it bothers me because, i was yelled at., much, and i just, feel bad about it and i, try really hard to not, any kind of situation that affects my children, no matter how excited i get, and lead to scream, hmm, that would be likely to keep, pregnancy or not, yeah, that's good., yeah, i know., i didn't talk about it until yesterday., and, oh, i was pregnant and, i didn't want to be married and i wanted to be married, and i just.., didn't think it was the right time for me, and, i had, pretty much made my decision that i wouldn't keep this pregnancy, but i've made the decision myself, and when my partner found out uh that i was pregnant, he said he wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me, and so this decision was pretty hard, because i felt obliged to do so, and felt super guilty to not, and, <drops microphone> oops, and uh, this is correct to, hang on this earpiece falls, that's where we're going., that was probably the hardest decision you actually know what no, i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i've ever had to make, i'm sorry the hardest decision i've had to make, was in my life whether or not < clear throat>, the hospital was supposed to kill life., or a life support machine for my father, or not, that was the hardest decision, because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that, and to have been, to draw on the situation in which he was, not able to do anything at all, either speak, for itself, was beyond, who he was and i just couldn't see him, like that more and he would be a vegetable that i was told, so i agreed, to track that, not, hardly ever, < slaughter>, too many things are going around my head, and pretty much around, mostly on weekends because my older children are traveling with their friends, even if i, i know they're coming, i mean, i'm worried all the time., uh, how they are when they come home and so i really can't sleep on weekends most of the time, but.., and you sometimes it's just so many days not a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> i faint, but it's hard, very stressed, my son is.., it has been, uh in dealing with some legal issues, and um is currently imprisoned, and uh, it was really hard., yeah, i was probably very short., moody irritable, well, i often think of many things that don't even happen <laughter>, my mind just goes from one, point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there, you know., it's interesting., nope., no, yes, about three years ago, for my, about o b g, proposal, i don't know., see a psychiatrist, yes, well, um.., i've been, in the process of change of therapists, so it is about, because the program i was in, um, appropriations lost, and i lost my therapist, or the therapist i worked with and so it has been, approx. two months, maybe three now, and um but i noticed when i was in therapy, that it was just a complicated part of my, my life my week too, to my therapist, um, it really helped me., management, um, when i picked up my son., when he was released, from to, prison, um, a go getter uh probably know you uh she would use the term hucker but meaning, that i, i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs, do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know, legally natural, um, outward, maybe sometimes even a little for going out for them, um, and, compassionate, sensitive, loyal, mm, all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter>, the screaming was one., um, only the little things that, drove me so crazy that i could see myself., to do them and it bothers me very much, about what, mm, empty the throat , um, not too much really i don't know, empty the throat , to go to college right after high school, and do not wait, um, and <sigh>, that i didn't really have to be in a relationship to be happy, or that you do not need to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and, do not be in a relationship and still be happy and, life, um, what did i do?, mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good, yeah, that's good., i was

uh warm friendly hello when you pass in the streets out here, people think that you uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing, so, i don't like that about l a., previous uh i was on the road a lot i was a truck driver and plus uh an entertainment uh bus driver for several, uh motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yes, well, that's a beautiful land, so it's just a beautiful land., see uh uh the landscape uh visit different cities different cultures, uh different cities uh and see how, basically like the rest of the country uh lives, a few not so good a few bad uh and a few good uh times see, denver colorado, i lived in denver for a few years that uh really is a great uh, city, uh, and then i lived in uh atlanta, which is uh uh really a great state where you know that you have the southern attitude <a> a southern attitude southern attitude, that is friendly to everyone and comes out and, and, let's see., i was at least back and forth in this country., 16 to 20 times, yeah, it was like it was an adventure., < slaughter>, uh arkansas, small stone, where i had to get into a uh, you could say a dispute, with the hounds down there because, as you know,, i'm african american, and down there, they're very biased that you know they're the.., southern, uh, what the rebels were uh no rebels, but uh, what were they, uh confederates, they still have this tendency to think blacks?, or any other culture except white are not uh, valuable people, yeah, so i had an incident down there where it actually turned into a shootout., but i'm fine., a little of both depends on the time, on the time it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know, i can go because i like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and, i know how i said i uh i had some conversation before so, at clubs i am more outgoing, shyer in social events, < slaughter>, meditate, very good, very good, because, if i let my temper get the best of me, i tend to, cause

uh, okay girlfriend <laughter> uh, we recently split up about two three weeks ago., because of a dispute about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do, and she still wanted to do it like this, uh that led to a dispute and the argument ended up in us so yeah, it was emotional uh, but, i'm fifty five and it's not my first break up so, i'll just take it in step and move on, uh, well, it's probably that it, no one can really be no situation, i feel at the time when you when you are having a situation at any given time there is probably always a better way to handle it, after the fact, but.., i'd say back in the 1980s, when i and my wife broke up., i think i could have done better because i was younger, hot tempered., and more irrational so that i could have treated you better yes, what the way i broke the way i treated this situation, well as i said uh young and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and, uh, unable to communicate, with another person at the level of, of, understanding, < slaughter>, hmm, leaving home, well, it was like, <sigh>, what can i say?, it was about, one o'clock two o'clock in the morning, and i've just decided to pack and go

in a closet that i can't open to remember., but most of what i can say is uh uh, i'm not going to go into detail, but an incident where, it caused great physical damage to a person, in the last two

successful and that was a big disturbance for me, yeah, but you know, like i said, i'll take everything with a grain of salt., and i keep pushing, because, you can't stay angry., or vengeful to a

dinner, and the children are all at home and they ask me questions about their homework, or they turn on the t v or and my husband is uh, i'm worried about things i just don't have to think about., and once i said, okay, everybody in the kitchen let me out alone, just let me finish dinner., and no one would, and i just had more pressure to build and build, and i actually took one of the pots and just hit it against the stove <laughter> really hard to get like people, watch what i said, it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> , which is still there, so i should have done it., went out early and took my deep breaths before i did, um, it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child., i wasn't married., i had a very good friend., um, oh i was i was, thirty two at the time, so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger, i'd probably have decided to do an abortion, but at this point in my life i'm fine, i'll have that, um, and i had, um, i got pregnant by the man i was married to and still married to., um, but we were only together for three months., and i lived with, a good friend of mine, who i share in the peace corps, um, and she and so i didn't know this guy very well, i didn't know if we could raise a child together., i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with someone else., um, and my friend suggested that we raise the child together., to even suggest moving to costarica to raise the child together, um, and so it was a lot of, um, large decisions, who would determine the rest of my life, um, and i, the decision based on , more common sense and practice, um, but i don't regret this decision, i think i made a good decision., to marry my husband and, raising our child <laughter>, they're older, now my eldest is seventeen., he is around <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he is very specialized in engineering, he gets his pilot's license, i'm very proud of him., then my daughter is, 15 years, and she loves acting, she has a boyfriend., who's that?, uh they see only once a week in the church basically, and they keep texting themselves, she's a very typical 15 year old., and then i got a twelve year old, he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and always makes noises, but i love him very much, he likes climbing and there is a climbing hall near our house., so he has a membership there, so he goes over there and climbs almost daily, no, i find it extremely difficult that i wasn't., my mother had a very difficult <d> my father died when i was young, and around my mother somehow separated, when that happened, so i had no very warm or loving, relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically grew up i was, from a very young age on your own, um, i mean, she was in the house, but.., had really no interaction with her, so i really didn't have, parental skills, you know that most people will be brought with you., um, i know what i'm not supposed to do, but sometimes it's very difficult and, i see my friends you know., very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they make cookies and everything is biological and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect, and it's like i'm not that person., , i'm trying to be, i'm i think i'm a very good mother, but i'm not.., a typical mother, i think i'm more, i'm more creative., many times me and we do a lot of things, but it's not a warm, cozy thing., when we camp, it's more, i'm more habitable when i go camping than i am at home, i think i'm more tense when i'm home, but i try to like through meditation and things of this kind that i try to become, calmer and more patient, i think my patience is what, i have to work the most, i've been a sleepless person all my life., i remember when a child was lying in my bed watching the stars walk through my bedroom window and, i haven't slept well in a long time, but i realize that when i do sports, and i do something intellectually with my brain during the day, i must be physically tired and intellectually tired, sleep well, and that's hard to do sometimes., and so many times i stay awake and read, i'll read until midnight., and then i try to sleep., usually i won't get up again, even if i wake up at three., and such things, but i will try to sleep again, yesterday i didn't feel as good as i was, i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday, because i planned to work on my garden., and then i build a butterfly garden in my front yard., so i had to plant something., and i just couldn't feel like i was doing it, i wasted a lot of time yesterday, but today i feel really good., so i feel more positive i feel more energy, so, no, no, um, i don't know that i just got a new mattress., didn't really help me sleep, but.., it was really good because i needed one for a really long time, and it was just kind of excited to be delivered <deli> it delivered and furnished and that sounds like some kind of secular, but it was, you know exactly how, i'm finally doing something positive, because it's, it's something i postpone to do and postpone to do and postpone to do, and it was like finally, uh, there and concrete, and it's like it's okay that i've done this job, that i can check my list., but also i have the children camp over spring break and, we just had a fabulous time and we sat around and told stories and around the campfire and made s'mores and such things and these kind of times make me very happy, <laughter> i don't know about, i think she's.., believes that i, uh, uh, more intellectual and smarter than i think i am, sometimes she comes to me with a lot of problems., uh, she always asks her advice from me she thinks i'm giving her good advice, and if she doesn't know what to do, she'll ask me., and sometimes she just calls me to run things., uh or just like to complain because i'm compassionate, um or empathetic, and, i'm just here to listen., and i don't need to give her any advice., i think a good listener and, good advice donors, i delay a lot, i start projects and i don't end them., i'm working on a lot of projects that i've started in the last few months, many of them are really creative projects and, i'm very excited about them when i start them and i will, almost finished, and then, i don't know what's happening, i'm just losing interest., um, sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to end it, that sounds a little strange, but, um, i'm working on it., i'm trying to take care of them., oh, my god, oh, do not follow through on the odds that i had when, i came out of peace <p> peace corps there were a lot of things i could go in i would have gone to get my master's degree, um, with a scholarship and such things, but instead i got pregnant and married, and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed, but the second time i got pregnant, it was right., where i had to fight for a management, and i realized my limits where i could not be pregnant and have this child and did everything i had to do to get a directorate, and so i really wish, so that i resigned, um, and i wish i had held on to it, um, because then i would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and, solid career, um, not, base decisions on emotions sometimes i around and not i have had some really bad bosses, the jobs were wonderful., um, but, my ego got in the way, and i would've told myself to let go of this aspect of the job,, the, selfish, reactions i've had, to the bosses and focus on the work and do that really good, about my children actually, um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal, ahem and, uh people are really interested and they were like awe that, you know someone who really did this so i'd always be when i was a little girl., my neighbor was one of the first people to go to the peace corps when it started., and i've always said oh i want this one day i want this one day i want to do this one day, and then finally i came to the point where i had to either shut up or do it, so this is, that was, one of my proud, experience, all right., thank you., see you.",7
445,", yes, i feel great, i'm out of los narrowes california, around the weather, the opportunity, and the sea, it's crowded., overpriced, and a little dirty, i've been, good it is nice to see other places in the world and meet other people and cultures, i worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer, and traveled to alaska the aleutian islands, korea japan, and the caribbean islands, um, be in galena alaska and be in a small plane, and travel in a snowstorm, and surviving, as if i was on the brink of death and life, but i lived, the art and economy, i don't know that i was attracted to the arts at a young age., and the business went with him, yes, yes, to be able to entertain people and feel them and earn enough money to have a pleasant life, more outgoing, um, i always feel very confident with my thoughts, and i like people to know what i have to say, i listen to music, and i'm sitting with my girlfriend, and she calms me when i'm stressed, i could work on not being very good at it., last night, with my girlfriend, she asked my advice on something and, when i talked to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud i wasn't angry, but i was irritated that i was told to calm down when i didn't really want to help, i just wanted to relax., <laughter> i agree, um, sometimes when things don't go my way, i get depressed or excited, and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings, and look at the bright side of everything, no matter how bad things get to the bright side that is my goal, it was very difficult, but i'm working on it and it seems to be a little easier, when i took care of my mother and she died of c o p d and then it became lung cancer., i decided not to tell her that her condition had deteriorated so she wouldn't be afraid, and i had to sit because i knew her symptoms were getting worse, but i couldn't tell her the truth., and i made her think that everything was fine, it was, uh, my mother sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and i saw her health decline, that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better, oh, i don't know i'm trying uh, be thankful that i am alive and try to focus on my own goals, and do not dwell on the negative things of my memory, my girlfriend is a very good positive <po> positive influence she wants me to be a better person, ever since i met her, she's been trying not to make me angry., not to feel negative and to be a nourishing positive zen like person,, what she wants is something that makes me better, so i have to surrender., it's very simple, i sleep well, sometimes i wake up when i have nightmares about my mother or something, but i go back to sleep., it's unknown, i don't know., it just happens, i feel good., anyway that's my reality, i've been hit with a lot of financial, uh problems but i handle <ha> dealing with them well actually, i looked at it like my girlfriend told me i had to do this, so it's at the top of my mind now, no, no, today, when i woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and i had a lot of goals to achieve and i'm each one by one to reach, it gives me a feeling of performance and happiness, my ideal weekend would play music with my girlfriend, because that's something we like to do, healthy <hea> go to a nice dinner with healthy food and maybe exercise and feel good with my body and mind and mind, uh, likely, as a strong willed person with a big heart, but has a short fuse and, maybe complains too much about his own life, i wish i couldn't complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side, well, once i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was terrible and then i felt it was the best i had ever done, so that and i wouldn't understand how someone could feel like this, and i didn't know if it was out of jealousy or it was an honest opinion <opi> review so that i felt bad about it, as it is my goal, nothing i regret, i felt, ten or twenty years ago, i don't know., to <sigh>, good everything i do, i enjoy it is hard to choose an exact event that i really enjoyed, i don't know., how to put one over the other, when things don't go my way and finance come and i don't get jobs i'm qualified for but i feel i won't get, my fair chance, on occasion, it's very frustrating, i don't really feel guilty about things, sometimes maybe when i'm angry and i shouldn't be, i feel guilty about never wanting to be, short with my girlfriend ever, she wouldn't deserve to use someone with vulgar language or screaming., or something like that, so i don't want to be around her like that, so i'm guilty, my accomplishments of my skills through my music and my other skills that i have and my hard work has paid off and uh, i am very proud of this, okay, thanks., goodbye.",1
446,", yes, i'm wonderful, how are you?, california, yeah., the weather is one of them, uh, the food., um, and the path uh everything is centrally located, mhm, transport, the smog, and, it just got really crowded, i wouldn't say much, but i'm trying to, travel, not less than, once or twice every two years, um, simply explore different things and be able to, have different experiences around, things of this nature and you know it, learning new things and, only different cultures uh i like to learn about different cultures and when you travel, you get a feeling of, um, you know feedback from different cultures and different areas, so i like that, well, i just came from miami uh last year i went to miami for a week and a half, and it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time, around and around the weather was wonderful people are really nice, it was really a great experience i went out there for., a special event around them have around something every year around where everyone comes out of all, and uh you just have a party and hang out and meet new people it was really funny, um, well, from this trip, i'd say, um.., swimming in the beautiful, around miami beach water was wonderful, yeah, that's it., development of children, mhm, well, um.., i've always been interested in children since i was younger., um i babysat a lot, so i had a lot of experience with children at a young age, and when i got older, i realized it was something i liked to do, that's why i'm here., that's when i looked around in children's development classes., and i thought it was something like i'd enjoy it, i started taking classes, and the rest is history., i am, it's.., 15 years in august, yeah, that's good., my dream job, i'd say.., becoming a principal, well, it's something i've been thinking about for a while, and.., i just started the steps to get this going., so i'll be back in school and i'll take classes, so i can do this., because it's a dream of mine yeah thank you, it will be quite difficult. there are several years of schooling that i have ahead of me., and you know it's definitely going to be a challenge, but it's something i'm ready for because it's a dream job of mine., so it's something i'm ready to do,, i'm ready to do, um, a little of both i think a little of both i can sometimes be shy about, and and also starting from, but i think a little of both i'd say, < slaughter>, i'm meditating., i'm a big big meditator, so i love meditating, i just love to read and just have nice quiet peaceful time, oh wow i'm very good at it, very good in controlling my temperament i around, let's do it again., a series of, meditation i do, it involves deep breathing and around, just really center yourself, until you can feel your heart beat and you can, to really feel everything in your body, and it really really allows you to relieve stress and control fear and anger, and things of this nature that helps me very much, oh wow, it was just about actually unfortunately, it was last week and it was with my husband, and, it was about, how he sometimes reacts to me, uh it can be a little aggressive, we're just trying to work with it because i don't respond well to aggression., i'm totally singing out, and that's actually what happened, so.., yeah, that's it., i felt, very frustrated, um, and i actually felt upset about, but frustrated and i also felt sad because i don't like fighting like this, it was a little bit of all these emotions at once, uh.., a situation i wish i had treated differently, to be honest, i haven't had a situation like this yet., in the years i have quite a lot of kind of, um, you know, somehow mastered, my answers, to a certain extent, irritation, i kind of managed to do this., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, it was good when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenager, for mother, i was pregnant when i was 16 and, um, i had.., a lot of pressure from the family to.., give up my child for adoption or, to cancel, and i chose life so that was, that was one of the toughest decisions, if not the toughest decisions you should make when you're a 16 year old., teenager to teenager, whether i wanted to continue to be a child and a teenager, or if i wanted to raise a life when i was a child myself., that i think was the hardest decision, i had to do it, um, well, i mean around my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later, and i'm really so glad it was one of the best things i've ever done., do not choose to cancel it and choose <choo> pro life, pro choice pro life and, i didn't regret the decision. it's my only child., i love him he's just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special about being his mother, i know., no, it's not easy, it's definitely in trouble., um, just like everything else., um, but at the end of the day it's really rewarding, um, and you'll just see the life that you've brought into the world and that you've raised, become a productive citizen and go into society and, easy to make their way and it's really rewarding it's really, oh wow, so many ways around, the first way <wa> uh the first way i really listen to my son and i, accepts his feedback even if i don't like it, and i allow him to express his self, luckily, unfortunately, when i was little to, there wasn't much conversation between parents and children, it was more like we were just told that you know what to do and we did it., um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self, i allow him to give me feedback to give me negative or positive, because i feel that it is really important for a child to develop her voice at a young age., and around as parents you have to be supportive and that and somehow around, make sure you feed this, because this is, type of, the way they develop, you know, and it's really important, so, i am different in order in many ways in this rite, thank you., to <sigh>, all right., it sometimes depends on it, it depends on the time i go to sleep, it depends on the time i woke up., so it's a lot of factors around i can't just give you an answer around i'd say that, it varies sometimes i can go to sleep and fall asleep immediately, and other times i can go to sleep and it could take a while to actually fall asleep, so, it varies, i've been feeling great lately, i was really.., i can't say that, like i said last week, it didn't affect me, um, you know the fight with my husband, but.., different than that i felt really good, no, i didn't., no i didn't, you know what honest i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up, i'm happy because, this is a chance for me,, use carpe diem grab the day, i feel blessed every morning, i wake up, it's a blessing you know, because, i know some people didn't wake up., some people are homeless, go through so many situations that are really daunting, and i'm not like that, i really feel blessed, every day, thank you., in order to , care of patients lovingly, friendly, um, type of reserved, um, well, i wish i'd already graduated from college and had my master's degree, and sometimes i wish i was a little more knowledgeable, in certain subjects, and i can change if i can change everything, i would change that these two things, and also i would be a little more starting and less from an introvert, you know what's no regret, no regret., you live and learn for nothing is perfect, everything i've been through has made me the person i am today., so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person i'm today, oh <sigh> man stay in school to stay in school and, get your training and put that first and foremost before a relationship, even before your career, i really would have told myself., to stay focused and, get a great education, i'm very proud of.., where i came from, as a teenage mother, to be a statistic and actually change that, on my same i've been doing my uh same job for fifteen years now i'm really proud of it, i've been married for thirteen years, i'm really proud that happily married, to my best friend and soul mate nothing is perfect, but, he's my best friend and i love him and i'm also proud of, my son is the mother i am and the son i raised., i'm proud of the job i did, and i'm.., i really applaud myself for it, you're welcome you were wonderful thank you, goodbye.",0
447,", yeah, that's very good., i feel great, it's an early morning, i don't have a school, i'm excited <laughter>, uh born and raised in los closees california, mhm, uh the fact that you like snowboarding and surfing, doing two drastically different things in one day, i come from the neighborhoods i've lived in, and i'd say the population of uh, lower socio economic backgrounds it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks, i wasn't really in new york connecticut mexico and texas, but, pretty young, hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter>, uh mostly when i travel by plane just the view and the air is amazing, it's remarkable, the first time i was in new york, i was about 11 years old., and i made sure that i got the window seat in the plane and only the feeling of taking off is just intoxicating, but uh, we're gone., around <tisk> at night here in l a and it was the next day in new york, so it was kind of confusing to get used to the change of time, the first thing i remember was getting a piece of new york pizza., it was delicious <laughter>, yep <laughter>, , degree with a bachelor's degree in communication, so i can go to the military as an officer, actually, it's like what, i don't know what it's like., you must have a plan., and that's the only thing that's just on the spot and it seems like it's falling on the spot for me, to be honest, a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it is, but you can be paid to do nothing <laughter>, yeah, that's good., but.., likely, i was definitely shy when i was a kid, but i grew up with the experience of college, so i'm much more open, uh i write music and i usually work like this when i feel stressed, i just make a number of push ups and raise some weights, i'm pretty good at, i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year, and i don't know, it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do, decide how only bottles leave my emotions in place in their corresponding outlets, not really, it was rather an interpersonal thing that, i don't know., probably yesterday something related to sports the playoffs are on things like that nature, to <sigh>, hm < sigh>, so many.., i guess in my senior year of high school i waited until the last minute to apply for u c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't turn into applications and i'm pretty sure i would have been admitted, so it sucks, but, hey, this is a fascinating question <sigh>um, i don't really know., the death of my grandmother, safe, um, my grandmother died when i was 11 years old, she drew me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me, she raised my sister, my brother, and my cousin., and her five children, so she was the matriarch of our family, and <sigh> the next thing i had to get a mother, and it was hard, but, it will take seven years for the next to come to the thirtieth., and i've grown a little bit no more tears, i'm a foster child, so i was emancipated by the nursing program about two years ago., but around my immediate family i'm pretty close to them, and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome, i've known them since i was five, so it was pretty cool, pretty easy i fall asleep pretty fast, it's no problem unless my back hurts you know, then it's a problem, mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i think i drive more aggressive <laughter>, uh a little stressed about a few problems i can take over, but i shouldn't stress because i can either do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work, um, sure, um, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh,, i have a few parking tickets, no parking tickets they don't move injuries, but they're tickets, and i didn't realize if you'd miss the courthouse without being in the hospital or being in prison., that you could not be excused not to make your court appointment, so i had, three no shows in court that sucked, tickets that are thousands of dollars and i don't have any money like that, i don't know., it's pretty hard to deal with when you're trying to make something of your life, but, there are so many barriers and obstacles that like you have not forgotten, so i don't know that it is sometimes stressful and, yeah, that's good., think about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my mind and i don't really communicate, to everyone because there's nothing anyone can really do for me, so i just fill it up like i do, all, not very after doing it for so long it will be a natural thing i think, no, no, hm really happy oh, why is that such a difficult question?, i don't know, i'm pretty satisfied with everything i don't know about extreme happiness right now, every day is exactly the same day, looks like it's.., uh dunking, on the other side of the clippers center there is a basketball court there, and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah, mm i have, four close friends i've known for over eight years, and i don't know, studious work hard, determined, i don't know., <laughter> yeah <laughter>, mm probably my metabolism, which i don't really have control over, uh i don't know, i'm pretty satisfied with myself, hmm <sigh>, i think in my sixth year of uh, uh primary school, i wasn't the best student, but.., i had a teacher who was diligent and how he let me down throughout the year, but i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards, so it was like a situation that i overcome after i felt so bad, and bottom, uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad because if it wasn't for his stars, i don't think i had, to be the discipline where i'm now in college and so that he was pretty influential., uh, i remember this time i was in the desert or uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his father, and we are actually stuck in the mountains and as if we had gone down a gorge, and then his jeep did not come upon a rock, so it was beautiful, yeah, it was around <tisk> it was kind of weird i thought i was superman i was trying to move a skirt, that was thousands of pounds that didn't work., but yes we finally came out we thought we were stuck in the desert, but it was a fun time to drive in the desert, if i didn't have my license, so it was fun yeah, about this day or in general, mm, unlike the u c thing, where i did not apply to the schools in time, i regret that, yeah, that's good., hm, i don't know that i was ten years old, ten years ago., uh.., i have no idea., that's an interesting question., first of my immediate college uh immediate family as in my mother my brothers and sister to go to college, so yeah, it's pretty in, yeah, that's good., no problem",1
448,", yes, pretty well done, oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven, and i've been here since i was no more than a, californian <laughter>, i'm a welder, um, i just.., i don't know anything about it., it does and builds things and repairs things that, fascinated me and, uh uh i was actually pretty good at it, so i stuck to it and that's my job, i never had what i just had., uh <sigh> somehow always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support me and my family and uh, i was satisfied with it, i just lost my uncle and he raised me since i was seven years old., and uh, except for my wife, i don't have a family anymore., um, he died last july., and i'm, i'm starting to get over it., i knew the day would come, but he was my last living relative., i was depressed about it and uh, but i'm better., it depends on the atmosphere around, when i'm with people i don't feel well with,, type and manner reserved, but.., when i feel comfortable, and uh, i feel like i'm fit in good i'm starting out, < slaughter>, < slaughter>, right, i enjoy old movies uh old uh good it's movie noir and uh i love these old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and, i'm trying to choose a movie that's uh, from then on, people were different from them, i don't know it's just another era and i enjoy it, yeah, that's good., my wife uh i probably don't say as well as i think i do, but, i have to admit, sometimes i lose my temper., and it's after her about things i shouldn't lose my temper about, but.., i'm working on it and, uh, i've had this problem since i was a little kid., oh, yes,, i was in trouble with the law when i was a lot younger., you know, when you're young, you think you know everything and you know you'll never get old and the future doesn't matter., but it matters because everything you do when you're young., uh follows you for the rest of your life and, i don't regret things i've done, but if i could go back, i would definitely make different decisions., uh me and my wife we, we do not argue that we do not agree, and it's, she's very strong willed and she's a game for me, so we go back and forth, but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh, uh say mean things or hurt each other we're just her is, a determined, willful woman and <sniff>, i'm who i am so, we go back and forth and, lately, i've been the one to <sigh>, bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long term, it's just her and me, and there's no one more important to me., when i was younger, i wish i wasn't following the people i was following., and what i mean by that is that you know that you're running in a circle with certain people and, with an ego greater than my common sense, and, that got me in trouble <sniff> i was a single child and uh, i enjoyed being the center of attention and, always the girls laugh or people think i was cool or whatever you wouldn't think i'm kind of overweight and bald now, but, when i was in my twenties, i was a completely different person and, <sniff>, if i had had a few brothers and sisters, i might not have thought or acted like that, but i was a single child., i, you know where he went., people thought i was cool and that got me in trouble, the hardest decision i've ever had to make was, has granted approval , um, let my uncle die, he was on life support and his kidneys had failed, < sigh> and around, doctors said he couldn't do anything and didn't have him., <sigh> goes through every suffering, to, let him slide., and as you can see, i get very angry with my uncle, raised me as his own son, and, don't ever let me down, and he's gone and, because of lack of a better word to push the button, i never thought i had to do that <sniff>, but like i said, i'll get over it and.., things are getting better, my wife is always there for me <sniff> she'll always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than myself, , uh uh do simple things, it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to, but we're going to have mesh around < sniff> we enjoy each other's company, we like the same things and we, you know, occasionally go and do something together, but we, < clears throat> we just enjoy the company of the other and they, as i say, know me better than anyone and it surprises me sometimes, mhm, you know, <sigh>, lately, well, i can't say lately < sniff> if i don't < coughs> excuse me if i don't do, a strict activity or something that, really uh emphasizes me or straines my body, say it for a few days i'm just very relaxed and you don't know much to do, i get up automatically after four and a half five hours., i mean, and you know my wife's gonna say you know the guy you're not sleeping, but, i mean, i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i have to sleep again, i stay up all day and, i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep, but, you know for me that it's me., it doesn't affect me., well, i wish some things could be different, but i'm not dissatisfied about, i'm happy with my life there, like with everyone else, there are a few things i wish i could be different and i think that's in everyone that everyone else knows., but around <sniff>, i'm i'm i'm i'm happy, yes, i feel a little less motivated <sniff> around, recently good i can not say recently this was back in january, um, my wife and a couple of uh friends were, i noticed that i.., always forgetful and i couldn't remember anything, i didn't see it and.., you know, when they all brought it to my attention,, but still, i went to the doctor and.., they gave me the tests, and apparently i have m c i, which is a mild cognitive impairment and uh, i've been, over the last month or so, no one told me, i mean, maybe i'm getting better, but, the neurologist i saw makes me come back in a year and will test me again., hopefully it's not the beginning of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty < fif> fifty two, but, i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh, it could have been that i was told about him., uh, because of the death of my uncle i could have been quite depressed, i was not able to keep things and, all right, i'll go back in a year, and we'll see if i'm feeling better., i'm sorry., i don't understand you, i'm sorry., how <h, no no i didn't have, yes, two thousand one, um, i was, in a.., what is the word i'm looking for <sniff>, i was in a.., in a state of mind where i can only get in trouble and benefit from it if i did not seek help, around me was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder, uh worrying and thinking too much about things and, i think the worst and uh, i'm taking medication for it., well, you know, it's not really therapy., you know every few months you have to go to the doctor., do everything well and know that they only replenish your recipe <laughter>, it's, you know it, it's, you know it, like the next person, the next person, it's, i'm with emperor so, they'll talk to you, but they'll give you the impression that, um, you know i'm okay, let's keep driving and know they'll hear your explanation, but, you know, it they didn't have all the time for you that you can wish for, so i am good now if i really needed help i would, i would do something that would work for me., <sigh>, the last time i felt really happy, well, it would depend on what the event is, i'm always happy to do something with me and my wife and we enjoy each other and i know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i have nothing else, she's my world, but.., i enjoy being with her and we're doing things together and i'm happy all the time when we do it around, when i'm outside this circle, i don't know if that sounds right, but i'm not looking for luck, i can only explain it because i'm satisfied., i'm not, um, i'm not disappointed or i don't want anything, i'm you know what's coming my way is okay so, well, um, uh, um, uh,, i don't know that i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> around <sniff>, well, my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff>, she would.., describe me as uh, i don't think until i speak, um i um, leave the smallest insignificant things, annoy me and i get angry over, but the big things it's like, i let it go and she's confused by this <coughs>, uh <vocal fry> years and years ago, um, she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten in a little fender bender, and she thought it would be the end of the world, because that was my baby., and i <sigh>, you know, hey don't worry, we're gonna fix it and she was thinking, <laughter> that i wanted to hang her up or something you know because that was mine, that was that you know that was my baby., and she's leaving, you know her, you'll be excited about nothing, but you know i'll destroy something like your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money, you know it crashed, and you don't care., so, that's the only way to explain it., well, i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely on a meal binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably on the occasion with my uncle, um, i'm heavy, i'm the hardest i've ever had in my life., and i find it a little more difficult, i can't say harder, but i find the willpower, to say no and stay and train, or, you don't know that you're going to move now maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were, a little younger we loved going for walks < clears throat> and we lived in a, , boy, look at this miracle, what's in there, you know it's not like that anymore., i guess we're a little older now and, <laughter> a little harder it's harder to go with all this weight <laughter> but i wish i could change that because uh, i know it's just not healthy in size <sigh>, <sigh> uh lately, no, i haven't regretted anything lately., everything was all right, the, as i say, the, the largest, greatest influence in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never, in a hundred years or ever thought that i would, face that, situation and < sniff> i'll never forget it, but, they say time heals all wounds and it does < laughter>, don't listen to other people., uh, again i'm not trying to raise my uncle just because of what happened, but he used to tell me all the time, uh, he would see the things i did and the paths i went down and i kept thinking i knew better and i think many teenagers think that anyway they, the young lady i talked to here thinks,, they're invincible and i thought i'd never have these problems., um, i wish i could have changed a few things., the story of my past follows me, as everyone does., and that has limited me on many occasions and many things i am able to do, i don't miss her, but, if i could go back ten or twenty years, i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions i've made., my welding certificates around i am uh certified by the american welding company and i have uh < sniff>, this is probably the greatest achievement i've made for you, i know myself as a performance from around < clears throal>, people i know say i'm uh, well, i haven't been working on cars lately, but they said i was a natural crack for uh, restoration and work on vehicles and i don't see it, but, i was told that, once or twice, but i kind of did, i kind of started slipping away, i can't say it's because of lack of interest, but, i just don't feel the motivation anymore, i wish i had a bag of money and i had someone else to do it, so i feel <laughter>, all right., thank you., see you.",18
449,", all right., yes, i am., i'm good, thank you., < slaughter>, originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america, yes, the weather around i like that i can come to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just get any element i want to get, i can get, traffic <laughter> busy everyone is always in a hurry to, that's what this is about., < slaughter>, if i can have family in central america and if i try my husband and i,, go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean, the freedom not to have my daily routine and not to be guilty of not doing something i said i would do when i'm home and when i'm too far away from home to do it, then i have nothing to fear <laughter>, recently i went back to honduras, that's where my family came from., so it was kind of like a it's a double fold i get to see my family, but i also somehow get to be away from home, so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that somehow i can still have my freedom, and i don't feel obliged to be with them, so it's more fun this way, experiences on holiday or, for the most memorable experience, probably hawaii in lahaina and only with i love eating i'm a foodie so, to let the pig roast under the ground and just eat it so that i could never taste it as usual, so it's like a memory, it's a deep memory for me, because, no matter what i do with my pig, it will never taste like the pig in lahaina <laughter>, business and that was years ago, so i ended up in marketing, so i enjoyed i my business background has helped me in marketing, my dream job, hmm, well, i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook, and the only reason i hesitate is because i love cooking, but i just do it for home and friends and family, if it turns into, if it turns into a job, i feel like it just won't be as happy or i wouldn't have as much fun as i did you know how i've got now, but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and joy i have in cooking now every day, then that would be my dream job, i'm going out., < slaughter>, <laughter> that's cool <laughter>, uh depends on where i am when i'm where i'm actually the first thing i do is just somehow get a grip of myself that i'm always in control no matter where i stand by, and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e, so i just take a deep breath to assess my situation., find out what i can control, what i can't control and then proceed from there, but just breathe some sort of deep breath and get me under control., i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild tempered to start with, i'm not really getting upset., and so when i just feel hot all the time or when i just react i just like i said i just, do my own little self control you know, before i may have kissed, i might have gone for a second, but i'm saying my own little self control and just you know what comes on no that's mm it's not worth it, this person isn't worth it, the situation is not worth it, be who you are and just stay there, actually it was with my husband and we went back and forth about my relationship with my father and i tried to get a point about him and he was just somehow missing my feelings in it, and i wasn't wanting him to overlook my feelings and act like i didn't feel the way i felt, so i stressed my point in different ways, and then i found myself in a debate now and then, when i withdrew and said, no look babe that's how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel different i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings, when i came to my own conclusion, i felt triumphant because, the point of argument in my mind was to clarify how i didn't feel for him to force his you know he's very a macho somehow male guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic, and so i said no as long as i felt better because i felt undestooded and i felt heard, let's see., i can come to my son's mind that he's twenty two years old., and he's got a very alienated relationship right now and it's okay, i'm okay with it., he used to be a little more needy, so he thought i'd always look for or call him., unlike waiting for him to call me, and i think, it may be a very strange answer, but i wish i was his mother early in my life, which i would have somehow adapted so that he wouldn't wait so comfortably for me to be the one who comes, and look for him, he doesn't live with me, he has his own place., but waiting for me to be the one looking for him, and you know you're trying to make sure he's okay, i think that's probably much more ethereal than you meant, but, i would have done it differently, i would have mothered him differently on the way and released him at an earlier age, which means that i would have treated him more from an adult., and then he doesn't expect him to just somehow know you,, i would have killed the expectation in him that i would contour him if that made sense., woo < laughter> no it's not easy, you have to sacrifice and about just physical things you just need to make sure that your child's needs are in front of your own and, i guess the second part of this answer is that it's easy once you realize that as long as they're okay, you're okay, so, my son, my daughter, they both know that i love them unconditionally., so, my upbringing has become easier the more i have lived in this truth, where i expect nothing from them, but then expect no disrespect., as long as we have this clear line of communication, whatever still happens, falls under this category of respect, see them, maybe make decisions i wish they wouldn't uh it could be as easy as an outfit <laughter> you know, choice or as much as a career change, but i have to sit back and watch them listen, be open and then just, somehow just be there you know if they want to talk about it, but then also try not to manage it because i was also her age and i must remember that, i didn't want to be managed and even if i made a mistake, i didn't want to be judged, so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on my own, and just kind of just waiting around and luckily it's nothing important with my kids, but, whatever this personal downfall is just kind of being there and not one i told you i told you so about ghost on me, it fills the knowledge that you know i created the one you know i planned my two kids, so it's just a real one., it's an honor that i could do it, it's an honor that they're healthy., and it's fun to see them grow up to their own., and it's like they're mini me's, but then they're different than i am and so it's just fun, be able to allow them who they are and just celebrate as they are, so i enjoy the, wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties around i was born in the year after they arrived here, so their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle anyway which wasn't a bad thing, it's just that their upbringing style was more about making sure we have a home to make sure, uh we had the accommodation of course and food and clothing and schooling, but there wasn't really much time for my mother's relationship with my daughter as a daughter or my father's relationship with me as a daughter, so i had to figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent., i wanted to divorce my first husband because i would be the one who overthrew the whole situation.. he was a good father, just not a good husband for me., and after twenty years, i knew that i was going to be the one who said it wasn't working for me anymore., and, since i did that the domino effect was <ha>, it wasn't virtual, it happened <laughter> we sold our house, you know, split up the assets and then live apart and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while, and then i made some decisions where i didn't want to go through so much trouble, so i just.., has a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else, so it was just a very hard decision by, how it affected my children, that's all i care about losing everything, physical and all the material that might be less important to me, but it was hard because i knew it would affect my children, and they were the only thing that worried me., uh my husband and i didn't know you saw eye to eye on certain things regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a woman and that's just who i am and those were the areas that, he didn't confirm me because he somehow saw me as a partner who financed his extracurriculars, whether it was just traveling or whatever the case, i'm not here to talk about it., whatever he did was outside of you that you know the sanctity of our house., and i was tired of just you know work and he benefits from everything, but then not fulfilled as a woman or a woman and he wasn't ready to change despite all the advice we went through, and i thought well that this didn't work for me and i had to take care of myself first and i had low self esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love me, to love my children and then to get the love i should get in return., < slaughter>, you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just know you're good bad ugly or no matter what mistake i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day, my goal in life is to just rest, so when i have my head in the night, i'm just wondering if you knew i did something that i was ashamed of, that i ran over someone today., have i not known, and i am not holy or acting as if i am pollyanna, but i believe in karma, i'm a god fearing woman, so i just want to make sure i've done everything i should do today., and if there's something i can correct, you know, i'll just do it one point to promise me,, go back and correct it or at least learn from it and just don't make the same mistake on another day, really good light, you know, had some rough spots with the family individually as i said with my son, my daughter is a teenager, so somehow she comes into her own, so that's another relationship she's against me, i'm actually very looser, very bohemian style, she's very social you know, just out there, so somehow i need to find our balance, but overall it's just i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simple lifestyle, that i'm just kind of on my own care every day and i just enjoy my little, mini services, whether someone sees them or not, < slaughter>, no, i didn't thank god., no, really happy let's see, it's at home and i think it was when, wow, <mumble> different things that run around my mind, i think when my daughter and i got my teenage daughter and i got to understand <underst> anyway understanding on, our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend, but that doesn't mean she can't talk to me., and i think when she came to me the other day and gave me a big hug from behind me, without really saying something that i really felt, how she accepted herself, and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is, how she is, so it was a very, only she and i knew about it, but there was only one luck that nothing else could ever give me., < slaughter>, thank you., i'm reckless, i'm just very funny., you know, to any chameleon comes to mind, i just kind of acquislimate what kind of situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and only you know, brave when i have to be, i'm just very grown up i'm a grown woman and you know they'd just describe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that they're on extremely reliable i do as i say what i do, and all i know is that i don't know., i don't care about b s < laughter>, what could i change about myself?, uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what are some things that i would change about myself, uh, sounds weird that i wouldn't say much about anything really, i think i'd be easy, a little more conscious of others i think i'm one i'm super sensitive to others, but i think i'd just be more conscious, make sure i'm not selfish or i'm not tuning someone out just because i want to get through my yoga or i want to do something else, i think i'd just be more attentive and aware of those around me to make sure i don't insult someone, i have no regret that i think all the time and you know it's natural to go back and say if i have in this situation with the mindset i now what i would do, but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me, so i don't know, take advantage of it very well and then turn around and call it a regret, because i know i've learned from it, it probably sounds very textbook, but that's true, it's just how i live, so i think that, everything that happened well bad ugly or indifferent, for a reason i really believe that and my job is to take away from it, what i should take from him and take that into my future, so i'm going to take that you know, the hard knocks with the joys, hmm, be really with myself, this is one thing that took me twenty years to get somehow just to be kind of honest with me to hug who i am, to learn who i am uh learn my own infrastructure, be content with the innate things that are part of me., do not try <re> to revamp, don't try to renovate me or try to become something i'm not, uh i would still have chosen the same marketing career to still i would still have climbed the same company leaders, but i would have done it from an inner place, not that i would have lost myself in it., but if in relation to my family life i would simply have been more faithful to myself and so i would have had no kind of resentment, my family my uh my role as wife my role as mother i think that ultimately that's where my most important fulfillment comes from, because no matter what, at the end of this life, this life is this body in this leased vehicle., that i'm in around everything i'm going to do or all i'm going to be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cement chamber, , and i'm always just, true to that i mean, i was always faithful to that from the time i was eighteen and realized, i wanted to be married and have a family and children and all that, i think that ultimately that's where my true fulfillment comes from, < slaughter>, cool, thank you., see you.",2
450,", all right., i agree with that., i'm pretty good., i come from santa monica california, born and raised, i love the ocean, i love hiking, i love, you can have a bit of any world, here, the sea

haven't seen your shoes, but i've travelled, well, depends on where you go to i love going to hawaii around i love the beach changing the landscape, um, the temperature of the water, uh, different foods, airports, i love traveling, i recently went to europe., i was in belgium, for two weeks, and, oh i ate some good food and saw some family and, visited some museums and, oh and it rained what it

going fishing, two days ago, i also meditate <med>, i'm also meditating, how i feel relaxed at this moment, in peace, silence, depends on the situation, hmm <sigh>, i argued with, the people park the loosely narrow ones, about a ticket i got that i didn't agree with and turned into a terrible situation, and i, finished the conversation with <wit>, to accept the situation as it was and, not really want to deal with him somehow like fuck you, <laughter> no, it was good, oh, my god, selling my business, i wish i'd treated it differently., i didn't really have to sell the business, but i got scared and i sold it and, i could have handled it in a completely different way., anxiety, um, i was afraid to raise debts that i was afraid of., the economy was not good these two thousand seven two thousand eight i was, not to make it clear that i was afraid to raise debt, i was afraid of.., being sued by employees, i was afraid of uh, yeah, i didn't have enough money, i was afraid to be embarrassed, i was, you know embarrassment for, the money goes out, to <sigh>, yes, i would have behaved so differently if i knew what i knew today., it was, yeah, i could have., downsize i could have, downsize sold cars get rid of cars uh i, could have shortened the hours., i could have had it., reduced my expenses, and, sat tight with him and not and worked only through her and not, have reacted out of fear, uh if, i have my bachelor's degree in political science from u c l a and have just completed a master's degree in education., , mhm, my dream job, my dream job, is, not to work,

know the things i like to do like fishing and hiking, to be with my nephews, to be with children, um, yes and don't have to work, good for family relationship okay, so who lives today is my mother, my father died when i was sixteen, my stepfather died three years ago, so my mother is alive., and it took a lot of work it took years you know, but she's a my friend < f> we're friends you know we do things together, my sister lives half a block away from me, my sister lives one block away from me, she has five children and one husband and, a family i have to fight with, and my sister, and i can't spend much time with each other anymore, she has a life, a life you know she's busy., um, the rest of my family is uh lives in belgium that i went to visit uh, and this is all the family i have, i have an aunt who is very close to i estranged to, and she lives in northern california and we never talk, because she uh, she ripped off the family property, my grandfather <grandf> the estate of my grandparents, they, she took all the money and all the stuff and, and left her grandchildren and she, and mine you know and so uh, her sister and, my, my grandmother's daughter and grandkids and great grandchildren have zero, and there were a few < f> few million dollars, mm, so we don't talk, i'm not talking, we're not talking., and it's sad, excuse me, you can repeat that, wow positive <pos> my father was a positive influence he was a really real man, honest uh funny to pretty, i have an entrepreneur, an entrepreneur for whom i worked, who had a very positive influence at least in my professional life., um, i had.., a consultant at u c l a who was totally thinking about her, common, and some of the little things she had said to me, let me live on in my life, trust in the process, she told me to trust the trial., and when people have problems and i have problems, i take a step back and say,, you know, just trust the process it's all it works like it's supposed to be, there's another one., positive influence i knew in hawaii, that's what taught me.., a friend of mine, who lives on kauai, who taught me,, how to enjoy nature and teach me how to fish and, and i love her very much a great positive influence, healthy, healthy influence, it's not, i have back problems., so it's hard to sleep at night, i wake up in the middle of the night., uh stretching and, to straighten my back, i have a back problem that sometimes more often than not, prevents me from sleeping well, that's okay, i'll take care of it., i'm a little depressed, i was a little depressed, i didn't work that much, and.., i have pain in the morning and evening < eveni> i have pain thorughout the day in my back, and it's a little depressing, you know, i'm getting depressed, too., you know you're just thinking about it, my business that i sold and, you know where i would've been if i hadn't done that and, a general feeling of, i've been a little depressed in the last few years., yes, well, i've been diagnosed many years ago and i guess depression stays with you even though it's being treated, um, and i was diagnosed about two years ago, i don't know that it asked me on the questionnaire., and uh and i were looking for treatment, and then my insurance ran out, and the recipes, i couldn't make my recipes anymore, but now i'm back to.., you know, so i'm taking medication for my depression, therapy absolutely, i love therapy, wow that's huge to trust in yourself uh, trust in myself for confidence in my decision making, a general feeling of, total content uh, a sound record, you know, if i have stuff that bothers me that i can't?, i feel that i can't go to the person with, i um, can go to my therapist and, many times the problem is solved there, it was not a big problem, or i worked through it or the therapist by the therapist allowed me to consider another way of looking at the situation, and in this way i find to be therapy, really priceless, i think so., yes, i was., i think it was, i think i was told by a psychiatrist that i was what i had., and this was within the last, five years i think it was, look back now, what are we two thousand thirteen was there two thousand nine, so four years ago, not able to deal with as shell shocked not being able to deal with anything anyway irritable on the phone uh i mean just, i'm just.., everything would get me to fly off the handle and just not be able to just shock and, not and hides at me in my house do not open post post not able to concentrate not able with, with things i felt good that bombed me i felt overwhelmed <o>, and, the psychiatrist said it was post traumatic stress disorder, but, um, and i was given some medications that i stayed on for a year or so., uh or something and i don't know by,

regret not doing that., around at this time, i regret it., selling my business, i regret, and of course i can't control it, but i regret that my father died when i was so young and, he never really met me, and i never really met him., i regret uh, i don't regret seeing it, my grandmother enough before she died, i regret uh, i mean, these are the things i can think of right now, not putting away for retirement, i regret when i had the money to do it, um, yeah, that's good., i mean,, that's exactly what i'd say., stay with it., just stick to it, because to get out you have to get through, and, when it comes to fear or escape, i get the fear and i fly, sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then, everything works, wow, i am very proud that i have remained <sigh>, real, i'm very proud of,

um, you're a little more narrow minded., back there and republican <laughter>, around good original show business, but probably to get away from uh, cleveland, it was very difficult at first, i'm not used to changing, i don't like changing., the commission's position is as follows , uh meet new people and, finding out how to earn a living, all right., i like, the different ways you have different health awareness, the movies around, the variety of things you can do, the places you can go the weather, to drive the traffic jams, some of the, superficial attitude, the meaning of, well, not much, but i do., i just came back from vegas, visit relatives we met there, and i'm going to mexico, next month, um, see well the different, cultures as in europe have been, greece <p>um italy, um, i like going to places like mexico, where it will be sunny and just lying down, i went to last year i went to arizona, i've never seen sedona who was really uh, an experience, purely peaceful, on sedona, yeah, that's good., good sedona is a very, energetic place and i thought it was desert like flat, a kind of desert that looks, but it was very rocky and when you land in flagstaff, there are these beautiful, uh jaws, and the height is high and coming in sedona was very beautiful and, and after a day the pain went away in my back, that i had there for months, so, and you had this, even though we went to bed late and got up early, you had that energy., so it was really.., very mystical, in life <laughter>, or in sedona in life, um, well being on stage in boston, and that was great that i loved doing that., um, just to be with friends and laugh, are some of my highest moments when we laugh hysterically, well, um.., i don't know about a particular situation, but when i decorate for special events, and, i worked regularly with someone and we just found humor in everything and, just laugh and, and, i can't imagine a particular situation or what we laughed at, but, only to be with someone who is in harmony with him, my sense of humor and uh gets, my jokes and, you know i get his and we're, just to enjoy this moment, speech and drama, i graduated from college., no, not now., i was always interested in, music comedy when i was a kid,, sing with to records in my living room, and i've always been in choirs, at school and then, if i, i went to high school and went to the drama club., and i've always had an interest and i've always had an interest, a great personality and, good <laughter>, i don't know if i have a dream job anymore., i'm sixty and, i don't know if i, continue to strive to do something, at the moment i would just rather not work <laughter> and just, um, relax and travel, but.., i like being creative, in some way i can like independence, and i kind of did it this way, i'm fine., um, i'm watching my favorite shows i recorded., and i'm also a buddhist for whom i was a buddhist, around gosh since nineteen eighty eight, and i'm, a district leader in my community, and we have meetings and that really helps,, center me and bring out my higher self, so when i get tense or nervous i get chanted, sometimes okay sometimes not, much yes yes <laughter>, less and less, although it has happened less and less, but.., yeah, sometimes he does., it's.., creating difficulties, all right., i can't <c> <sigh>, i can't remember an argument that i remember getting angry like, was just when i was on my trip to vegas, i was driving, and the g p s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane, but when i got off the highway it brought me to the ramp that went back to the highway, about four miles out of the way and i just, i got very angry about, 30 seconds and then i had to, calm down and say okay, so we'll be late, you know i had to talk myself out., so it wasn't really a fight with someone, but.., i felt somehow, bad that i overreacted, um, you mean in my life <laughter>, many, yes, um, god, there are so many <laughter>, i just wish someone would tell me that i'm disappointing., information, for example , they won't use me for a job or anything, that i, to take a position which , um, i'm gonna find something better, it's okay and, go on instead of feeling what's wrong with me, and, you know i did something wrong and then i get angry with her and, you know that, whole uh, thinking process that really doesn't help the situation, and i do it more often, but i, since i started singing, but you don't know that., i'm not always in my high life state <laughter> where, i can do this., i find a lot of situations <laughter> difficult to make as you know what, to buy tv or something <laughter> but to, um, i guess <gue> i think the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences, and, um, or to leave my comfort, area <z> place, when the decision meant that i had to leave my comfort place, that would be a very difficult decision for me, and probably leave a relationship, very hard, because, you know i'm dependent on this relationship., so that i usually, live it from til, it's for you, you know, it's, they go or something you know it's very hard for me, to make this decision that this is not right and i have to move on, so what i usually do is i don't make the decision, and in the end i suffer, but longer, so, mhm, we can continue, um, all right., it's hard., because i don't know if it's because i'm in pain., in my back, and neck, but, it's difficult for me,, stay asleep, i would, i don't get it., a deep sleep, um, but, for, well, i'm so okay it's hard to say because right now i'm having this cold and i've got it for two weeks, so i took nyquil, and that's how i fell asleep, i've.., sleep better because it, but last night i woke up on cough, so it's hard to say, but before it all happened, i was.., it's hard to find, to sleep, and that's why i'm tired during the day and, sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable, but yes, i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or, emotional things or not, i'm sorry, could you repeat that, i have studied changes in my behavior, uh no <laughter>, i had not taken, no, mm, oh, i was happy last week <laughter>, well, i.., i wanted to.., vegas up to, meeting my family was my, my family flew from cleveland to, uh there we have a, a relative in uh vegas, and i drove with my friend, and it was my brother in law's 70th birthday., so, we all went and, had a good time in vegas, i mean, i fought through my cold, but, but it was fun it was nice, good <laughter>, you think i'm funny., you feel like i'm telling you what it's like, um, they all understand and they all say they understand me like this, people who don't understand me, i sometimes don't think they know how to take me, 'cause i'm gonna, i'll say something sometimes comes to sarcastic, but only <ju> that's exactly the way i talk, so, for my.., the, anger that sometimes pops up inside me, you know i'm just.., but even though that really made me do it, i think, a lot of the person i am you know all your, experiences make you what you are, and how to deal with it, makes you who you are and when you don't have them, lows you don't really know what hochs are, so i don't., i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen, whatever, but really what matters is today and now and how you deal with today, and i wish that well i can not wish that i know that i will have less of these, moments in which i, just burst out, you know that anger or something, i just wish that would happen more less, that the anger parts would happen less, and they are so, i guess it's going to be <laughter>, less, um, don't give up hope of living at the moment, and, everything will work, everything will work, and if you think that, then you really have nothing to fear, um, the fact that now, and for the last twenty years twenty several years i have, i cultivate myself and i'm too <be>, more than, compassionate man, and i'm able to, uh, <ss> understanding people better, and see that you know that their suffering also suffers, and, the, if you are treating people, out of this respect that they, they also have their problems and they suffer with their problems too you are able to live a better life because, you don't let it affect you, you don't take it personally, and at the same time you become more compassionate and more compassionate, you are happy and your life is happy, all right.",4

almost every minute of my day not being told what was going on in the person's head and then creating a situation, you know, i was kept away, i didn't like it., uh, i'd rather have <laughter>, mm, uh, probably the lack of time with my grandparents, growing up, it's just when they're gone, you're sorry you didn't miss the time with them., so, mm, uh one thing i really wish i could remember i was a, i was a professional athlete at once and, i had celebrated until four in the morning and then i had my event at ten in the morning., and uh, i was my captain and i embarrassed my whole team, and uh, this is one thing i really regret, i was a professional fighter, so.., yeah <sigh> like no party thought about other people but me, mhm, uh, i studied massage therapy and got my nursing degree, um,

do that i also wanted to help people, yeah, that's good., oh, yeah., yes, i want to paint., that's all i want to do is just paint <laughter>, um, i have two sons and it's time for me, uh, to continue

because that's the only way we can get along is through communication., how to communicate, my family is pretty much separated, so my family and my relationship with my family, on the reservation is very tight, the rest of the family we are all fragmented and scattered around the southwest, so it is not very close to all, uh, i have too many to count., start with my uncle my uncle was like my father pulled me a good way, uh , uh he paid attention to me, he told me that he taught me hard work at a young age., um, he taught me to protect my family, too., and taught me glory, taught me love,

oh, the therapist released me., um, well, i had noticed that i'm still dealing with pictures and emotions, but what i do now is that i practice really hard, taking care of myself and coming to these places, the things that, hit me to get scared or excited or angry, i've learned how to, to work out of it and to realize that it is not real, it's not real., it's just the emotion it's not really., so these are the things i say to myself like little mantras, and that really helped me a lot from the therapy because it taught me that these emotions and pictures are really not real., and yes, so therapy has helped a lot, i mean, it's just it's changed my world, yes, at the same time as the p t s d, three years ago, in my dreams when i dream , last night, i only dreamed of fighting and then in preparation fighting fighters and that was another thing to build fear dreaming about preparing fighting fighters, and then step before thousands of people and then i always end up fighting in my dreams, so it's always mm what scares me in all my dreams that i would have made the train and ended the fight and i didn't, and so it builds fear and stress in me and then i tend to act in my sleep,

the different culture, but after i've been adjusted, you know the sunshine keeps you here, i love the weather, i love the fact that i have the sea and the mountains, and all the things i can choose from and the diversity i find here, uh i, tend not to have things i don't like, uh, where i am, i know i'll find myself there, so and i like myself, so that means there's really nothing i don't like, yes, i do., uh i love to explore different cultures able to meet different people have a different set of experiences, and at the same time be able to share the common ground between, all kinds of people, it is a very rich experience, um, which, to the, uh i, i am thinking of egypt and the wonderful experiences i have there., i'm leaving., the people and the, warm and loving experience i have the knowledge that i get to follow, by exploring the temples and pyramids etcetera things like that, there are so many there really are, but i can imagine seeing a baby in a mosque., that was just really pure and it, really stayed with me, how similar, we are actually all, this is probably one of the things i remember most about one of my very first trips., uh, there he is., and, let's see.,

can't remember the last time i actually had an argument, um, i don't know what this is about., i imagine that the last time i argued about something might probably be related to money., situation i wish i had handled differently, you know, i'm trying to take every experience, how they come and try not to regret, feelings of guilt about the way everything, uh went because they're all very positive learning experiences for me, uh, that i'm exploring who i'm through, so i don't really see them as, that they must be different, i have to learn from them, or just accept what is, mhm, the hardest decision i've ever had to make, um, have not really a quote on quote difficult, decision you know because i grew up in a way, where my mother was extreme, wonderful in the way she always taught me to know that it was my own life, and so she would never make decisions for me, she always taught me to say she would always say, it's your life., and so, to make decisions for me not really come, as difficult to make, they're pretty easy to do because i've been doing them since childhood, so i don't really have a, most difficult, decision i've ever made, mm, event that i could erase from my memory i could not really think of one that i could think of that would be so terrible that i would need to, delete it again everything for me is a learning experience, so there is nothing really to regret or delete, uh very easy, once i hit the pillow, i'm out, uh, great uh a little more, uh, physical exertion as normal, but uh still great, < slaughter>, , the spiritual practices that i carry out on a daily basis that keep me pretty, evenly tempered, no, mm, no, that's pretty much every day., <laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm grateful i'm grateful, for my life and i'm only

experiences of life to be able to, learn to move effortlessly through any situation that arises, recently really enjoyed, uh, uh cooked a very wonderful meal, because i love to cook, so that was

it's very easy anyway somehow isolated here, mhm, i can't see your shoes, but i don't usually travel too much to boston and, hmm anyway florida where my parents live, but i enjoy traveling and many trips in california and here, oh, just to have an adventure, to have some fun, or when i go home, that means i'll see my family, empty the throat , to one of my travels mm god good, i like to go to northern california to san francisco i have family and friends there, always super super fun uh in god at college i'm with my college friend, when i was in boston, we went to san francisco and drove to l a and las vegas, so i realized that i wanted to move here, so that was a big one., in general, only, i guess it would move around here that i moved to when i got on a plane but didn't know anyone here., i just talked to a girl i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport., we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the flight was out here, it was big monumental, i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever, mhm, studied communication to get a lot of lots of different uh writing styles i eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and an english minor, writing to follow up the letter, writer uh good i guess you could say writer slash actress who's around, but i guess writing is first, hard, very hard because you need to push no one you will to do it, you have to be self starter, you have to do it, so it's very hard because i don't own that naturally in my personality i do, but not as much as i need to, i would say starting from in general, i <sigh> sometimes take a walk when i feel tense to hear ambient music helps when i need a soothing background white noise, soothing calming area and only, just your basic deep breaths and just take a minute to, to return to a quiet, neutral place, i'm, always better no <laughter> around i'm okay <ok> i'm, good at controlling my temperament, because i don't usually, have a temper too often, but if i and i lose my cool, i have a hard time controlling it, yes, no, <laughter> mm, fighting with someone for, my god!, i guess it was a friend., a friend a girlfriend it, it wasn't about that., our, our individual perspectives on a, a certain situation between us, which, were obviously very different around and it started as something big and then we realized that this, that's stupid, we don't have to argue about it, so it ended quickly., , i guess it would have been with an ex boyfriend struggling with an ex boyfriend relationship stuff that definitely lost my temper and escalated a situation in a way that, it shouldn't have been necessary, i wish i'd just left., mm, i don't know if i could have avoided the whole situation, but i definitely would have, made the result much less, chaotic, hmm, i guess that would be, hmm going away from someone who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh, but that i really wanted in my life and it was a true struggle with morality and, i have to say that i have to do something that's really hard for me to do., type of you know short term pain for long term gain and, i had to make some kind of adult decision relationship wise, but it was still transferred to other areas of my life and taught me that, you know you won't always, feel great <gr> every decision will not always be easy and feel good, yes, i was somehow forced into this problem, just what was going on in life was a way that you can't just ignore these signs., yeah, that's good., i guess it would be a special argument that i had with someone who was random., in some kind of public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could delete that, my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i am completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and, i couldn't ask for a better family, they're, the ideal, i'm sure my parents are just wonderful people who are taught only by example and, i feel like a good mix of both, it's pretty easy, i've been trying lately, it's been a little hard my sleep was out, but for the most part i have, come to realize the meaning of it and it has been quite simple, a bit edgy or fidgety maybe a little out of it i could seem like i'm, in a good mood because i might be a little dizzy and, uh laugh more just type of <laughter> high emotions, but overall get irritated around faster and, just to feel sweating more easy, just feel a little away, i've been feeling pretty good lately, mm not really only, try to be more concentrated < clears throat>, do things, i'm just trying to focus on what i want to do for a living., stop wasting time, or you'll know., simply procrastinating and and get things done and inspired go and see, you know you're with people who do what i want and just carry it into my own life., no, no, oh oh just a few days i was just with my family and my baby niece in florida and, that's why i went down there to see her, so it was just great that i'm always happy when i see her., likely to be considered as very, funny, humor would definitely be one of the first things they would say joke a little, smartass in my personality, but they would describe me as always, uh, unconditionally there for them and just, they know they know i'm there when they always need them., my drive is more driven and only always do things, i guess it would be a new, a new ex boyfriend who was a mistake of a relationship uh, yeah, kind of just, i think because he thought the way he thought about himself certain things he would say and, even if what he said did not directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i even felt with this person, like i'm letting people into my life who shouldn't be there., i'm wrong, and that was terrible., yes i don't regret listening to my gut feelings, don't test yourself., <sigh> <free throat> around big listeners, constant sense of humor, uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all, only people from all age groups racial sex, whatever i just yearn for variety and love, just you know that i'm just me people person, and i.., i start every day with an empty slate, i did some acting work on a series with a really big group of people and it was a very cool creative experience very inspiring, i probably come to i a alone without knowing anyone and staying here and tracking what i want to do., thank you., goodbye.",6
457,", yes, spectacular, this is an interesting experiment, < slaughter>, i'm from the middle of nowhere, <sigh> uh, the second of two thousand seven can, so exactly five years ago six years ago, um, rare as once every few years, uh the weather exists, so it's more extreme, and then it's, less, exciting, much less colorful, uh winter in minnesota <laughter>, it took about, the ride into that is, that's all it took the lights, uh, the lights took care of the rest, uh, i love that it's a huge concrete playground at night, so bycicles uh, have free reins of the streets i like all the art i love, the fact that there are so many different types of culture jammed all together and that if you are looking hard enough, you will find everything you really want here, oh, you know., the traffic <sigh>, excessive cost of living, uh, yeah, they're my big cattle., not nearly as much as i'd like., i've done a little bit, i don't like it, to know exactly how things will go, i like the fact that it forces me to, to act with people in order to , to deal with situations in a way that i normally wouldn't have, uh, last year i, hang out in san marcos for a little bit, after i broke up with my ex, and then, after san marcos i went back to iowa for a series of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to go to angeles, < slaughter>, uh, last week, managed to go on a bike tour for cyclavia, , when <laughter> he was basically a rolling green light all the way down venice boulevard and so he made a pile like, national news and, he was everywhere, but the rest of us as his support group, riding on big bikes and things we don't, bat one eye we did not blink because this is normal for our friends who didn't even do the most absurd thing he's done lately, that was just a happy normal sunday, but, our group of friends, is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else, < slaughter>, i used to be an introverter, but definitely an extroverter in recent years, thanks los angeles, um, empty the throat , once i found the right group of friends, it was easy to be social, pulled me out to be socially extroverted as well, bombastic for the first time and it's stuck, um, if i wasn't the most relaxed guy, i'd probably do things, but if i was really stressed out, i do all kinds of things, it's.., usually i try to enroll my friends to help me make an art project, what a temperament <laughter>, uh, , um, laughter panic because i really didn't want him to hate me, and i've mostly failed, uh, hard for him, i have mostly uh mostly with, a few scratches on my ego, uh, if , when all this went i tried to talk to him, but i was distracted for the first time on that day and so instead of, with my <sigh>, verbal gloves until i make it,, take a whole series of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was, not my most graceful moment, uh, i feel guilty about so much stuff., i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else, 'cause i love junk food it's really good, i have very little eating willpower because i used to be a fat guy, i don't know what the toughest decision i've ever had to make., uh made a lot of tough decisions, i guess <sigh>, it was pretty hard to leave angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty things., but, it wasn't even that hard because it urged me to do it like that., it's a tricky question, madam., uh oh you know broken collarbone, strong pain getting surgery on it all seemed as if it made sense at the time, < slaughter>, mm, no, my memories are important, i've lived a spoiled blessed life, and if i've changed something, it wouldn't be the same universe that i've lived like this universe., < slaughter>, uh, my little brother lives here, he's fantastic, he's waiting for me outside., uh, my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy, uh, but, because most of them live so far away don't really have to have too much relationship with them is positive and sparce, uh, jackrabbit has influenced me quite positively lately., she's a magical creature, uh, well, there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful, there's the part where they, managed, hit me with the best inspiration words there is the part where they, actually working on the exact things that make me excited, there's the part where she dives into and out of my life at the just right instance and then there's the part, where , she is 100 friendly and caring, all the time, all these things are really beautiful, but then when you add that and it comes with the fact that, she's doing all this, without wanting anything in return, i don't know that, <sigh> beaten <laughter>, uh, what a funny question, how do i know them, as if they were several people, how did you know?, uh, i know her through my, bicycle friends <sigh>, uh, the hard part goes to bed, but as soon as i get to sleepland, i'm pretty much there until an earthquake hits uh, so, i'm sleeping., bad, but then i'm a pro at it, so it doesn't matter, <deep breath> less verbal and that's it, my dark circles get a little bigger and i'm pretty much the same guy because i've done it most of my life, so excited that i might as well be in fire, by mm, because, the universe, in its, infinite, i suppose the word is sardinian sense of humor, uh managed to get me from the, reality, of magic, in the arthur c clark sense, nope., as a lucky man and <cough>, be vaguely conscious, it is my privilege to enjoy more time like this., uh, yeah, that's good., my excitement increases at an almost exponential rate, and i feel more and more inspired all the time, if i could only work on the motivation, i would be hired, not since you asked me on the form some time ago, no, uh, no, i thought i had it, but who knows at this point, that was a while ago., uh, i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to go angels and, started having fun mm and then the uh yeah the rest is old history, um, 20 thirteen <laughter>, uh, working on my shoes this morning was really nice, uh, an art project that all my friends, that was really nice, it's a nice feeling., < slaughter>, <sigh>, that's a very good question, i'm not really sure i'm going to ask him today., um, i guess i'm, enthusiastic, i'm, thesauric, and i'm, <sigh>, i have to say , highly analytical <laughter>, uh, it would be nice if i could get my superpowers back, that would be pretty cool., uh, how to turn on some of the fans, finely tuned and delicate machines, the chinese medicine has got me into, < slaughter>, uh, that's really hard., i think the thing i'm most proud of, would be likely, <sigh>, you know i'm not sure., < slaughter>, oh all kinds of things, but i'm working on it, empty

458,", empty the throat , yes, i'm fine, thank you., i'm from los closeles, california yes, well the most important thing i like the weather around i like the lifestyle i like about the diversity of the beach around snow, we all have it, some things i don't like about l a around, the rent is much too expensive it is ridiculous, i'm on my way., i enjoy seeing new places, going new places, it's different, everywhere people are different., it's fun., okay good the last one last year i went to the family reunion in new orleans so that was in june, and around, while i was there, we also visited diall louisiana for the around, the swamp tours, and vicksburg mississippi where my mother is and we spent the night in ferriday ousiana with my aunt, the hundred and one, this year in may, um, there's a lot to do., as far as travelling or only time, i don't know if it's just one., probably, if, i traveled with my father, since i have a lot of my travels from, um yeah, it was bus car sometimes planes uh mostly, which only i think i'll say mostly in the south, but it was, really funny, especially the roadtrips, mhm, only general and also dramatic, well, my dream job is, becoming a real estate investor, well, i've really been doing it for two thousand five years, i just don't have the capital right now, or the connections that.., since i like real estate, i'll just start as a real estate agent, so i should have my license sometime this year., outward, well, i'm not shy, it could be a little bit of both, but i'm pretty outgoing, to speak well of hawaii, i have uh live there for a year and a half, but what i do to relax is either to usually take a nap <laughter>, to take a bath, to or just try to get things out of my head and try to spend my energy in a more positive way, it's got to be worked on, but.., i know when to control it., when i have to, um, well, me and my ex husband still come into arguments around it was just over a text message but, actually, it was my fault, but usually it's his, but it starts little and kind of snowballs out of control, but, this is usually the way it works, um, all right., i don't know what else to do except pray for it because i thought if i moved into another house it would have passed, but i see that we're still in it, so, i don't know, maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right, then let him be right i think, um, probably a few things, but i don't regret anything i've done in my life, but.., i wish i had behaved differently., somehow everything in my life almost <laughter> i could have done it differently or i would have if i had the chance, but i don't worry about it because i don't regret what i've done in my life, the most difficult decision to make, probably, if i had to get a divorce,, mm, which were perhaps the hardest or one of the hardest decisions, it was just a lot.., a lot of things through the years around < clears throat> the relationship had somehow deteriorated around, if the relationship, between us was still good, then the things he did to, i would have been able to overlook it a little more because i have the feeling of how good our relationship is good and, it is difficult to find a really good relationship, but since our relationship deteriorates and there is only a lot of disagreement and dispute and, he's got financial problems, and he's doing it like that., i just decided to just forget it, i mean, i tried, but.., you know he didn't want to cooperate., um, well, i'm happy with what's going on now, i mean, i wish we could still be a family, but since that's not going to happen, yes i'm happy with my life right now, yes, um, something i can delete around, i don't think i really need to delete anything., i've finally talked about the way the kids treated me at school, but except that i don't think of anything to erase, it's a fair slash good, there's no problems, so i guess i'm just saying good, yeah, there's no problems, well, i'd have to tell my mother, yes, well, she's always supported me and, everything i've done, whether it's, good or not so good, so i think that's a blessing, mhm, sometimes it's not sometimes, well, i just don't get enough hours of sleep, i guess that's what it is, how i like to sometimes, so that's more the problem i'd like to get, mhm, only sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling as if i want to take a nap, i feel good., mhm, no, they were about the same., no, no, umm really happy uh probably last week because i had a little money so < laugh>, i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe mine for a conversational girlfriend i've known since ninety six., i really wouldn't do it., i'm not gonna say i don't think he's a best friend, but we're not really hanging out so much, but he's very generous to me and my mother, mhm, so, um, well, now i'm spending my weekends doing tasks and teaching and teaching., but maybe after the class work is out of the way around <laughter> maybe i can do something else, um, good to myself, i wish that.., sometimes i could put my temper a little more and naturally i would like to lose weight, to be a little more active and i wish my skin would clean up, it was probably when i was in school. the school years are terrible for many people because the children are animals., they're trying to make you feel like you're not like you., piece of dirt under the foot, so this is probably the last time as an adult no, i'd say i'm real, i'm honest, i support, and i'm just a good friend, no, about 20 years ago, just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you're eating for two, and you can eat a lot of food, as you're told., that's the main thing, i'll tell my daughters, no., just eat as you normally eat, but eat healthier, there is no need to gain eighty pounds if, the baby is only twenty pounds or less and you have to lose all this weight, to even though i came into some money now twenty years ago, i probably just thought about shopping or, i'd only spend it on frivolous stuff while i'd invest it now., so yes, i think that's what this is about <laughter>, around proud of uh <sigh>, mm, i guess maybe myself.., my children, k thank you, see you.",5

see new <n> <free throat>, see new places, when i was 14, i went to costarica to visit my father., and i was there for two weeks and that was the last time i've been there, in costa rica, um, seeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker, for joy i was happy excited somehow scared, it wasn't my decision, it was my mother's., she had planned the trip., yeah, that's good., uh, i wanted to be an art major, but, i didn't understand why i was in math classes among other classes and i thought i was wasting my time, so i decided i really didn't want to do that., so i moved back to l a., i don't really have a dream job uh i, but wants to be self employed, right now i'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer, but i'm not really sure, i'm very reserved, but the people i know i'm much more open and talkative, < slaughter>, um, to relax, i, walk on walks i walk my dog a lot, i'll call my girlfriend if i want to calm down., i also do uh, meditation, and self hypnosis, i'm trying., it, depends on, what <wha> how i feel, or how excited i am or how calm i try to be, if i'm really upset, it's much harder for me to calm down and, bring me down through meditation or self hypnosis, but, yeah, that's good., um, sometimes i lose it., i scream when i lose my temper and, i've put holes in the walls, not, not yet <sigh>, last night, my mother and i had a fight., it was, about me buying a, ticket last night for a greyhound, to go to utah, i go up there to work a few weeks and make some money and i had to buy my ticket a week in advance and i didn't want to do it last night., this situation last night, i wish i hadn't blown up, or, got as angry as i can about the situation because it escalated, my little sister, with whom i am very close, she is 15 years old and will be sixteen in a few days., i would do anything for her, she's the world for me, my mother, we fight, we push each other's buttons, i think she sees me as my father, she thinks that i, will succeed with nothing, sad, it's okay., um, i wish,, i could forget most of my high school years or my sophomore year, i didn't like high school or my second year., i, uh, become sober and, i'm leaving., i don't know what to say., drug withdrawal therapy, um, when i was sixteen, i got, i just started taking some other drugs and, it came out of hand, i guess, and, my mom wanted to help me and i didn't want the help, so i kept going to different places and run away and not, i wanted to be in those places, so i finally agreed to go to utah and try to get sober, , um, he's my best friend, my whole life since i can remember and we grew up together., he took drugs with me and has been sober for more than a year., almost impossible, i don't have to sleep the night before to get a few hours., or i don't sleep well, i'm against pills., and i stopped smoking marijuana and now i just don't sleep, or were not , last weeks, yeah, it's not fun., i lay in bed until i

think i was 12 the first time i was diagnosed i was diagnosed multiple times though, um, last time less than a year ago, uh my mom was looking for help for me she saw that i was unhappy and she was worried, no, uh i held first in june when i finished my uh drug rehab program, in utah, of the last year, i'm learned coping skills, so i'm able to.., calm down when, i'm angry easier i know how to stay away from my trigger points and getting away from staying away from angry, or become depressed, it may be, when the person is ready to change, and want it, two days ago, it was because i was with my girlfriend that we had a moment., and so i was just overwhelmed by the happiness i think i, < slaughter>, trusted, um, funny, shit, i don't know., outgoing smart athletic he would, yeah, that's good., i wish i wasn't i would've melted so short i, i wish i wasn't depressed, i wish i didn't feel like i needed something to help me sleep., i wish i was totally dependent on myself., um, when i was younger, my father would uh, he hit my dog in front of me once because he was mad at me., so he started hitting the dog and i don't know, that was probably the biggest thing i was little i just remember being sad, yeah, that's good., everyone has something to regret, <deep breath> <sigh> so as not to be so naive, hmm, uh, i went to hypnosis., i had a, an appointment for hypnosis a few days ago, it was really relaxing really soothing and i feel like it could help me, one of my mother's colleagues., they are based on a, psychiatrist who is really good with a d h d and patients like this, < slaughter>, um, i'm athletic., um, i'm nice., i like it, i've set other people in front of me, most of the time i don't know if this is a negative or positive quality, i, i don't know., my ideal

my favorite and i've lived all over the world i love it i love l a, much, < slaughter>, yes, i've lived, in paris and i have been a lot around the world, it's just.., fun and it's it's it's it's it's an explosion it's good to see new places it's good to, we have to go., experience all the, fantastic to attractions and and, <ss> and cultures, i mean, um, uh, um, uh, i tended to actually do a lot of them around i would probably do them differently i think i'm more than one person developed now i, i lived in paris for two years, so i lived in spain., spain was funny spain it madrid is a party city and then around, and then that was all the work they were all work, so i worked, so it was.., there's a loop you didn't really appreciate what was around you and then, i mean, i'm still.., i still love to go just to know you vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really, a moron for this kind of stuff, um, i guess madagascar, was pretty much just, really annoying because it was about it in the eighties and, it was like you were seeing a lot, uh people who'd never seen white people before, according to the guy who's been driving us around, he might have lied., but it was just, it was annoying africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah, i'm in the process of getting an early childhood education., graduation and then i got a little paralegal, but that was really just, just for the.., just to get the scholarship i didn't really have a concept of what i want to do now i really do, i said, i'm supposed to rattle, i don't know if you guys were able to overhear, i really think that.., the way in which the school system at the moment is all about it, it makes people in, in order to only, just uh dog eat dog to you know i don't like the way, people <peo>it i think it's so emptying the school system now and i feel pretty bad for everyone, so i want to try to fix that, that would be my dream job, so i'm excited that like i want to go in a direction i want to and yes, that would be my dream job to work, with somehow getting to children on a more organic universe, you know, uh trajectory, um, i think it could be done, i don't think it would be done about, some kind of.., legislation, except here and there, i mean, it always comes to you knowing., facade and farce itself anyway, but i think there are ways, i have always reached children anyway and they have always felt where i came from and so, i think you know there are ways to talk to the system without even using the system, i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think, um, i don't really know, i'm kind of i could even work out there could overcompensate some debauchery for what's actually shyness and vice versa, so you don't know,, <laughter> yeah, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's cool., um, i'm definitely.., uh try to reflect and stay in a fairly clear space as often as possible, a lot lying right now i'm in transition so there's only a lot and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot, so this is, quite reassuring i'm not trying to do i'm not really doing something that's also, tense, unless it's time for it like time to drive at a job or time, you know, go some things happen meetings and stuff, but otherwise, i try to stay in a rather relaxed room most of the time, so it's not like break and, but you know it, and i do., i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer is coming, so i'm going to swim a few more, if i'm really outraged, it comes out and then it's me who's a kind of, bad parts right now because it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child, so.., there are times when i'm just gonna blow up a storm just to get off some steam, a little bit, but usually there's always.., you know someone, in the periphery that it gets and you know it's like this bumper sticker, if you're not outraged you don't watch out so, as a rule, some kind of reason can prevail., oh well i mean, these are times when i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i'm arguing with people, it was a lot of times when i'm flat out, you know to sabotage or definitely just, if uh what is the last certain time good i, you know that i've lost my temper terribly with, the woman who gave birth to me because in many cases she is intrinsic, i mean, she's pretty much a terrible person, so i recently lost my temper with her., i felt like.., i mean, i like it again, i think i said that just now i felt, in a way, good, because, i see., you know what's contrary to not getting it, this is, even worse, but i guess there's another side of the bank, of, the thing to get to where, you can be a little more constructive about it, it's like, you know, you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a terrible travesty, but then you have to figure out how to deal with the terrible travesty., but i mean, i didn't feel like i didn't feel like shame i really felt honest no shame i didn't feel i didn't feel, there are times when i feel that it was stupid to lose my temper just because, there are people trying to use this against you, that's all., but i never feel really bad for, being angry about what i'm angry about, when i was pregnant, i wish i had.., like i said, i've been through it., such an awakening upon knowledge when i was, it's like an undercover., that my respect has become a big issue, and, when i was pregnant, i ended up being so disrespectful in the place because i was a hippie on the beach for six years, so i always felt like i was being so disrespectful in the place where, to i was ready to be when the child came that i, stormed out, about what was a good survival mode before, but, let me jump out of the frying pan into the fire and they had my child, so, yeah, that's good., it sucks., yeah, that's good., i don't want to erase anything from my memory, i may have consolidated everything and, working together, i don't know., and integrated i don't want to erase anything from my memory, well, i got it right or i got it wrong, < slaughter>, yeah, i guess the hardest decision was whether or not., characters around, sign mediation agreement with d c f s and i should have said no, just let us go straight to court because the, there's nothing wrong with me just, it may happen that , give a s s i check by bullshit with my mother and i would only have, did you know?, courageous enough to just go in there and do that, and instead, i sniffed out and made her mediation, and they tricked me, over precautionary, it's, horrible horrific bourgeois quality, intrigue and sabotage is bad, it's okay., someone i mean, there was.., you know there was something., some great people uh back from afar i didn't somehow, really.., a really great ability to build relationships, and i'm working through that right right now and i think that's a lot of why i don't have my son, but, as i have grown and developed, i have seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so this is wonderful and, but otherwise you know a constant, you know, contact with someone who's really good for me, it's been hard for me,, come to this point, not so easy in these days at all, i'm so i don't, completely centered and then there were some, um, actually, you know that., uh, people think it's funny to bother me or shake me as they pass by and so there was real harassment, and such things, um, i'm still pretty polyanna'd out i'm still forging ahead and trying to be as pleasant as possible, i'm tired and empty and a little frustrated because i know that., i was kind of, that somehow i'm a little bit, around my around energy and space is usurped <u> usurped and i can say, and i don't know how to get through that and past it, no, no, um, there's i'm basically i'm very very happy pretty much, blissful person, but, in order to fight this battle for my son, i have a kind of trembling area that, it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my street in childhood before i realized that i was such a happy person, are thrown there again, so i go through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes, but, you know, during the day, i'm gonna think of something completely true and organic and i'm just gonna stare at something and wow that's beautiful and i'm gonna be reminded that i'm, pretty close to my mind so, um, i'm trying to stay there twenty four seven i'm pretty spiritual in this way, um, um.., uh, fun, i mean, if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me, it's gonna be pretty competitive out there., that you know that's me is gone from you., that i'm funny and that.., and the, i think that's bad that i'm funny and that i'm good and that i'm trustworthy, um, just uh i'm i'm not necessarily changing, but grow through my ability to connect with the people i want to connect with, and from the people who, to manage to , to, drain me, i told you, i'm sorry about.., to leave the place where i could have delivered my son even though i was, um uh a kind of, abuse, piss off your mother <laughter>, i'm sorry, you know it and you like a lot of the <th>, and and, yes and to open your eyes, look what's going on, i am proud of my spirit and outlook and, my access to what's really going on in the world and, my for alertness, of which i am only proud, i as a person, all right., you're welcome., see you.",9
463,", yes, i am., i'm pretty good, uh i was born in los angeles california, yes, i like the fact that everything is close to all the shops the shops, , around the traffic <laughter>, i traveled, but not too much., uh going away from your usual days to explore new sights, um, three weeks ago a month ago i went to read vegas, uh with <wit> me and my friends and we just went sightseeing, um, in las vegas we went to the hoover dam, and around it was breathtaking around, which it was really big and we saw the great gorge and it was impressive that i have never seen anything like this, i studied nursing, i graduated two months ago., so i took my uh board exam to be licensed, and i passed, so i'm just waiting for my license in the mail, my dream job is to be a registered nurse, um, a long time ago, when i was a little boy, i was hurt, and my parents had to take me to the hospital, and, the doctors came by and they had to sew me on the leg., and i saw all this and that made me want to track it the medical field, yes, i'm very happy, my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it is it between <laughter>, i'm close, i'm very close to them., mm, when i have a problem, i go to them for help, um, someone who was a positive influence was my best friend., since primary school, yes, yeah, we've known each other since we were in third grade., and we went to primary school and high school together., and he lives like two blocks away, so he's basically like a brother of me, i'm shy, um, i really don't know that i've always been a quiet person., since i can remember, what do you want me to do?, i'm going to my room i turn on my a c, and i just relax in my bed <laughter>, i'm pretty good i'm pretty good at controlling my temperament yes, the last time i had a fight with someone, was about, um, work, i was disappointed, not angry, just disappointed, because my manager, he wanted me to do it., do something faster than what i usually can handle, and he already knew that, my workload was a lot, but he didn't understand how sad it made me., mm, i can't remember one., the toughest decision, i ever had to do was, early school leaving, um, i felt that i wasn't really part of it, far away from home, and so, i just thought i was in a major i didn't really like., and so, i have decided not to go the next semester and go home l a, to the moment i see it, yes, i'm very happy that i did that, because i didn't go to nursing school and i wouldn't have been a licensed nurse now., i don't have an event., um, it depends on the days i work or where i don't work., yes, i work at a store early in the morning., i'm leaving at 3 00 in the morning., and i'll be out at ten., so it's really hard for me to get a good night's sleep, if i don't sleep well, i can be a little grumpy, irritated, or just frustrated with the situation, i've been okay lately, okay, i've been good., no, i didn't., no, no, hmm, the last time i was really happy and excited when i found out that i passed my license board exam to be a nurse, < slaughter>, my best friend would have described me as a nice sweet shy quiet guy, to speak physically, i would change how i look from the outside, um, i'm a little overweight, and i'd like to, lose some weight and just look good from the outside, hmm, i don't have any., no, i don't know., to this one time, when i work, it's a store., i, i took some goods without buying them., it was a risk that i took, but, since no one was there and, the opportunity <opp> the opportunity was right there for me to get it i just got it and i took it home, i don't know., yes last weekend i went to i went farm sale with my family, and it was pretty funny and going on different yard sales and, find uh random things, to i bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was, on it was only for two dollars and so i got it, and now it's in my room and i'm sitting on it <laughter>, i'm very proud of the fact that i'm a nurse, that i'm a nurse around i'm just waiting for my license in the mail and, after that i would simply send my resumes to various hospitals and and nursing homes, see you.",0
464,", mhm, i'm doing well, what about you?, mhm, um, i a <l> let's go close but, i currently reside <res>residence in inglewood, wait, did i answer your question?, i don't know., all right., oj l 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1., um, wall paintings, the sea, what else is it?, the people, my family's over here., this is the best part, what about you?, oh, wait., um, i'd say, the smog, yeah, the air could be cleaner., and, yeah, that's good., um, that's pretty <pre> i mean, there are also good and bad people., but yes, for the most part it's all good, yes, i was in mexico and the temples., and northern california so yes, travel, like clean air that is good it is healthier for your body, clean blood flow, who are for people, culture, and stories and when you come back, share stories like your friends, yeah, anytime., like now, or if , okay, like this one time i was little, we went to the temples., and it started to rain, so let's just start going through and like if we got to the top of a thing i didn't know before, the higher you go, the higher you go., the smaller the steps become, so, how people had it back then, uh smaller feet, so what happened was, as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways, so that my feet could measure up to the steps, but when you get up there, it's a nice view, i don't know what to do., general education, but, mainly art, yes, i've taken a lot of art lessons, uh, good., when i was a child, i crawled on walls with chalk, so i thought you know how it kind of stuck with me, i was just following it., so, yeah, that's good., my dream job, would be paid for painting, painting art, yeah, that's good., um, yeah, that's good., pretty simple, um, it's not so much that it's hard, it just needs passion, um, persistence, and faith and will, you just really have to believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself, the more likely you are to be successful, mhm, i think i'm shy in some way, time and places, but i'm also going out when, how i have the energy, so, i have a feeling it's well balanced., as if i were shy when it, i guess.., okay, to be shy, you know, and i'll go when, like the need to actually, to have fun or just to explore, it feels good like, if that makes sense, but yes, < slaughter>, yeah, that's good., to relax, um, i don't know if i should say that, but i smoke weeds <laughter>, so this helps, and, i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax, you know especially when i blue the color, because the color blue relaxes around me, and also green, when i use these two colors and take a picture, it calms me, yeah, and you got a blue shirt, yeah., my temperament, to good my thoughts, my thoughts control my feelings, and my feelings, yeah, that's pretty much like that, my temper, i'm trying to make sense, you know, how good it is to go crazy, or when i get angry, what will be the result, you know, so, controlling my temperament is easy, through the formation of my thought, to <sigh>, the last time i had a fight with someone, was with my father, and it was because i wanted to eat, but he wanted me to buy wine, so right, when the food was ready, i was hungry to eat and he was like no, so that somehow frustrations me, and, the way i treated it was how good, i could just eat when i get back and i'll do him a favor., you know, and then, after you know that i could just eat in peace, so, yeah, that's good., my family, it's pretty good., um, my mother my father have a good relationship still < s> still married, and my brothers and sisters, we help each other out, so that's good, it's just, yeah, it's like a team., a situation i wish i could handle differently, hmm, that's a good question., i mean,, can i get a scenerio, all right., um, a situation i could deal with differently, now see, that's the thing, how i feel like, if i'm quiet in any situation, i could find out., you know, but when it came to a rubik cube, maybe, how would i deal with the situation just by, uh fail uh fail make mistakes, because i would make the right mistakes and follow the right lessons, so, this is the best way to answer your question., you know, yeah, that's good., a positive influence, pretty much., anyone who told me the truth was a positive influence you know., for example , yes, even if it may hurt like oh the truth hurts, well, they're not trying to be mean, they're actually, good influences, so i would say my friends, my mom, my dad., my brother my sisters, yeah, that's good., mm, see, that's kind of like, you like me i've had some pretty bad experiences with as on shot tip and with a knife, but at the end of the day, what it did was to give me more insight, it made me more conscious, and, it taught me how to read people a little more like, easy to feel things and also how to avoid situations so, although it was bad and it kind of like, scare me, it prepared me like, the world you know because that happened to me when i was twelve thirteen years old, so i was already exposed like, you know, like rifle knives and all that stuff., it's bad, but it's good in the long run., you know it because, when you get out of the burglary, it's like, nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know it in your head like oh i've been through worse, so it's not so bad that you know, and, so yes., the toughest, um, man, see this right now uh for a moment when i was stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it, but uh toughest decision as far as life changes, lives, whether the school should continue, higher education, or not, mm i somehow chosen, to like, i went to school, but i decided to pursue my own like, i learn more by connecting with people who are already in the field where i want to be., so that was a tough choice, because there is no, in order to guarantee that i, for example , how to run the right people, but i took the risk, and you know i met the right people., yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., it's really very simple, sometimes it's like i could sleep in ten minutes., i could turn my mind off like i'm just calming down., how slow down my air patterns, yeah, that's good., mhm, lately, i felt, good, i feel like i have free will., how at this point in time i feel like, when i have chosen a path, of a kind used in the manufacture of motor vehicles, my heart, i could, you know you're here., but i'm kind of like, still decide it's like everything in all these paths in the air, i'm just trying to make my own, i don't know., that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will, so yes., lately as in the last two weeks or today, < slaughter>, all right., yeah, you know., um, yeah, that's good., things happen that would change like, my feelings and, for example, right now it just happened, what are you doing?, for now as, this experience for one is like a shift in my mind, because, yeah, it's like, it's technology you know it's like a journey to see how far, for example , you could think about it, and then do it, reality, so that's kind of like moving my thoughts right now, this experience this whole experience, yeah, that's good., uh post traumatic stress disorder, no, depression i know what it's like to be depressed, but diagnosed by a doctor, depression, how, how it feels, how does depression feel?, it feels like, it's like a bird in a cage, being depression is like, a fish that cannot swim in the water, i feel like depression is like a bird without wings, um, pretty much it feels, as if you were limited., but then the thing is, to get out of this depression, it's like you have to, awaken and change your perspective, and focus on, as i would say colors help colors, and help people who talk to people, yeah, that's good., be depressed, mm let's see, mm, i don't know., for example , it could come as if it could happen every day, like in small doses., so, as i could say today you know earlier when i was just alone i felt a little depressed, but then what happened i fixed it like, called a friend and, met with him and yeah, i mean, at this moment, i feel pretty happy that you know., i'm talking to a virtual person, it's pretty cool, and, yeah, that's good., now i feel happy., < slaughter>, um, sometimes hard head, like he's trying to teach me.., a certain lesson, whether it's art, or as in my character, and, yeah, he'd probably just describe me like that., for example , for example , he would listen, but at the same time he will still do what he wants to do, pretty much like, i don't know., yeah, i mean, that's what he's telling me, but yeah overall good person, probably just exercise, around my diet food, my food intake, and yes, just movement, pretty much it, my health, mm, i'd say when i was in middle school., or, elementary, also a little high school, but what it would, yes, what it would be, it would be either, um, good pretty much my art <laughter>, like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kind of like, like garbage, and then i'd be like oh, damn it., either i could accept it and be like yeah it somehow looks and then fix it, or what i'd do back then would be like fucking you know, just linger on that thought., and then just like, stay a little while and i'll finally get out., of course., most of the time, it's people's words., and ideas, the, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's it., regret, yes, i have some things i regret, like what?, all right., sometimes i feel like i should have finished a whole university thing., but, i mean at the same time i feel like, if i really wanted to go, i had been going, so yes., that's some kind of regret in my head, ten or twenty years ago would be to seek spiritually, feeling comfortable, you know, learn how to choose your thoughts your thoughts i would teach myself, um, choose the right people you surround yourself with because it definitely has a big influence in your environment, uh certain events that you would experience, and as far as your general happiness, yeah, that's good., yeah among other things, but yeah, what i'm most proud of right now, is my painting, yeah, that's good., i'm proud of it because, i feel like these pictures i'm releasing are things no one else could duplicate., you know, it's like it's some kind of thing and it's like where you know it., it has its own signature, so, so yeah, i'm pretty happy about it, yes, thank you very much., all right, thank you., mhm, goodbye., < slaughter>",0
465,", yeah, that's good., cool, i'm hanging out, you know, on an adventure chilling, culver city california, yeah, that's right., all the different microcosms and different places and peoples and scenes and things you know that it is very large, it's crazy., i don't know., i can't have mine., of course there are a few things i could say, but uh, i don't know, i mean i like l a i even like the bad that you know it's just part of the experience in general you know, < slaughter>, yeah, i've been all over the country., a bunch, uh again it's like going to another world, it's like quantum leap that i can transport to a completely different realm of people, and uh you know you're learning about her and hanging out and, drink beer and smoke grass and write and, rape and rape, do drugs and hang out more and, all kinds of shit man it's crazy, < slaughter>, oh, really., oh okay um, yo i recently went to san francisco, and i was there for like eight days i rushed at this house party in san

usually i ride a bike everywhere but i was just like walking, this all the time and, it was cool i was crazy exploring, i was going to i came back home finally then after that i went straight to texas, and made some shows on the way to texas and stayed there for eight days, and that was it was knarr, it was crazy, i don't even know, man, there was so much that you know i had fun., i went to this place, the salt sea., and me some of my bike friends we around <sniffle>, we got into cars and went far out into the desert and we around, yes, it was tight, we burned things, we burned a car, we drove the car it was like a street warrior type of car, and it was it crazy man, like it was like fifteen niggers on a car, like we went naked into a creek., i have h lla shrooms did h lla molly, a ridiculous amount of grass smoked, was left behind drunk, someone wanted to give me some mescaline i didn't want, but it was like march., before i went on the other trip that was like the forerunner, to my other trip it was the salton seafaring, but yes, it was tight, i saw a lot of nudity this trip, yeah, really., i'm fucking absent., going out for safe, smoke herb, < slaughter>, what did i study?, um, um.., oh i studied <laughter> about photography and photojournalism, and uh, yeah, yeah, that's it., must use the computer free of charge, must use baller ass cameras for free, and i would

dream job is not working a job and am i, this is the dream job of getting paid for me., well, that's it., i'm pretty good., like two weeks ago i was at this after hours, one i was already like super drunk and two it was after hours, three it was like after hours, man i had some pens, these guys took away my pens < clears throat> pens in my like fanny pack i had like a fanny pack, so i had pens in

gone, accidentally overturning a beer, and he gets mad at me, he's like you have to go now, and i'm like it's not my fault, that's your fault, but then, but then, while that happened, my homie was attacked by these three great old security guards, and then you know when i saw them attacking my friend when i really lost him., and i and he and i should rather let go of my friend now, he's like what you're going to do, and i'm like what you're going to do and then how he threw me to the ground, then i and no, he had his arm over me, i put my arm over him and threw him on the ground and then it was broken, but that was the last time, i got angry., it was cool it was fun, life, you know, huh i made <gibberish>, perhaps this situation could have been handled differently., it could have been handled differently if they had handled things differently, then i wouldn't have to react., it's not like i was angry that i was distracting from the reaction that i had to react like that., because like justice, like i couldn't, it was unjust, it was like, i'm not a mean person at all, but when i saw, one of my loved ones being attacked i had to come, and how you know how to react that, and they were the hot ones, you know what i mean, i was like yo ye niggas tripping like yo, chill out this is a tiny little white guy, you're a huge mexican nigga, like you're falling back., you know what i mean, it was crazy., < slaughter>, guilty, i don't know that when i'm hungry, i'm gonna steal shit from business., when i don't have money, i guess i'm not really guilty because i don't really know, yes i don't feel guilty about, food should be free, know what i mean, but.., yeah, i don't know., i lie i guess i lie <l> everyone lies sometimes i lie sometimes, perhaps a little bit as idle here and there exaggerations, okay <ok>, nah nah never, the toughest, i guess.., i don't really know what the toughest decision was, but i get confronted with tough decisions, and that would be like, i have so many friends sometimes, i can't really hang out with everyone on a weekend, so it's like i have to make decisions, like i'm going through this sector of the city., i'm going to hang out with x y z niggas when i go over here x y z niggas so it's like, hard, you know., these are tough decisions because i never let anyone down., so uh yeah stuff like the decision to hang between friends with, ouch, it's cool that i live with my mom., i come home like every three to four days, so i am, who, what can you repeat the question, um, my aunt, oh, she's just very nice, she's like a little blind old lady., that cooks really good, and it's tight i don't know, something i could erase from my memory, i wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory, 'cause it's gonna be like, because how, the experiences you're going through make you who you are, i think weak people want to delete things or block things like, there's no way, i mean, there's shit that was tough., but i would never say i wouldn't want this to happen, because you know you have to learn from experience that you know i want to make you better., all this shit is like a test you know., this bad experience is just a test you have to overcome, and be stronger and not like curls on and be like oh my god life is hard oh, you know that shit's for weak people., i don't believe in it., i have compassion for people who, who want to do something like that, but i still like it, i don't see logic in it, mm, i mean, i stay up pretty late doing all kinds of reckless ass shit so uh, but when i'm home, and it's pretty easy, i could just go to sleep, you know, when i get tired, i get tired, yeah, that's good., lately i've been on this as i've been celebrating hell hard lately like oh my god for at least six days, how to come today to do this conversation with you, was the first time that i was able to come back to the qualer city since as friday, because i was in town and then it was like cinco de mayo, and it was like you knew random ass parties i went to with buddies., smoking ridiculous amounts of cigarettes drinking beer, shit, made some mollys., shit, made some coke., shit was crazy yo it was just like uh, it was a rock star weekend, or one week, or, type of material, this is post traumatic stress syndrome., no i didn't, i have not been going on, but i'm getting, oh i mean shoot saturday i was hella happy, < slaughter>, it was great., but i was under the influence so, but it was still great you know i was crazy empathic, for example , crazy like a flirty, mm i was freestyling like a g i was like kicking hella rimes <sniffle>, it was dope you know., analyze my life realized some things i'm going to change about my life and uh yeah it was i had a ball it was great, it was awesome i < >, oh, yeah, that's it., no, i didn't even have a crazy comedown., i'm like i'm cool, i definitely won a few pounds from last week i've drunk a lot of beer i feel a little foreign, but except that, it's me., ready, it's okay., i don't know how a lovable guy, people love me man they like me not they love me, and this shit is crazy, i'm just trying to be happy, i'm trying to make people happy, and you just know,, its really posi core, as you have said, how this is hella positive <p> positive you know, man i really don't wish i could think i'd lose weight i think it's about, but except that i mean that i ride a bike every day like my legs are pretty strong, maybe i'd just get more buff in my arm, but that's the only thing i would change and i don't really <r> i'm not really in a hurry to change that, like if that happens just living through me and i ride a bike more, then yes cool, but i don't know <n> i'm not you know abrupt change i don't need, i'm sure my gradual change, but i'm not i don't know yes, i wouldn't change anything, but if i was, but really nothing, because i'm chilling right now, uh, i don't know that i broke up with something like that., in august that felt bad about me i think, and yes, it was just someone i wanted to go out with, but they just broke up with me and like this shit sucks., but that was probably the last time i felt really bad <cough>, what exactly do you want to know about it?, oh, how.., i don't know that we just went out and then she was just fucking jealous and sometimes walked through my cell phone accusing me of shit, but then she ended up with me, just because she wanted to snoop around with other people., and that was the relationship at a glance, life sucks, you have to adapt and change the man., know what i mean, don't walk away from it and walk to what you said., yeah, that bitch gave me s t ds shit, that's the only thing i regret, yeah, man, it's a cold game, but i got the shot it was cool i'm like boom clean, but so is it., i don't know that she's a cool person we're still hanging out with., you know, she loses further i'll just keep winning know what i mean, do not run away from him, do not run to him, know what i mean, < slaughter>, wait wait ten or twenty years ago, i was only seven years old you what i say my seven year old self, he wouldn't be able to understand the advice i'd give, what did you say?, oh yeah he wouldn't be able to understand the advice i'd give him, i'd be like, just to fuck, read a little more books or something guy like, uh, i don't know, man fucking it's gonna be okay, you're you, you're great, just hold, you do cool shit and you have a ball, i don't know., i don't know., i wouldn't want to change, and that's why i'm saying that., because, if i told my young self to do something else, i wouldn't have grown into the person i'm now, even being able to say something to my young self, if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all the shit are real and time travel you know, everything i do in the past, will, this life would be a variable now, so i'm going back there, tell him to do something differently, the course of the story and then the time stream that i may not cease to exist, you know what i'm saying so i don't want to., i'm just gonna be like i'm gonna screw up even more., but yeah make more mistakes because the only way, to be a better person is to make hellish mistakes you know, at least the, at least that's like my ruthless state of mind like you when you screw it up, because you'll learn more from it, you know they say what they say, around experience is the best professor, you know what i'm saying, that's basically what this is, how i think you know what i mean., < sniffle>, i'm proud of this life that i'm here to do things like this <laughter>, like i'm so excited, i was all over the country, i was on people's albums., i write i do voiceover work from time to time, and yes i people know me i rap i ride bikes, i've infiltrated several, i subculture my subcultures and types of people in the city, , and i don't know, man., i guess it's like i'm living my life like i'm running for mayor, but i'm not really running for mayor, i'm just to be the best i can be, so i kiss my hands and shake babies on the way and it was a great time, and it could only become bigger and better, < sniffle>, are you sure?, woah, this is crazy., see you., i love you, <laughter> you love yourself too, that's tight, should i press the button now or what, oh, okay, well, can you wave?, do the, wave, oh, you're not sure., see you.",2
466,", <sigh>, yes, uh, okay., < slaughter>, the angels, the weather, um, the diversity of the environments of the ocean you know different environment or environment diversity, < slaughter>, i don't like the superficiality of people., around the narcissistic attitude around, i'm just.., the, it doesn't have a small town where you feel., they only know the heat the human type of heat interactively, so, yeah, that's good., no, i'm afraid of flying, and i've developed agoraphobia., < slaughter>, uh incredibly difficult, yeah, i guess you mean the agoraphobia more than the fear of flying., it's more of a new development and.., it's.., oh, it goes on, <pregr> continue to get worse, uh, it's very.., what's the word?, immobilization and and very oppressive, mhm <laughter> yes it is, how to cope with it, just.., i'm just trying to uh, do what i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in order to take small steps, to i read a lot i read to bibliotherapy read around, and i try to inform myself, the professional literature so that i can hopefully overcome it one day, mhm, uh, yeah, definitely., um, uh certain things trigger it like around closed rooms, um, travel in a car around, i'm away from home to be in someone else's car., things beyond my control, um, uh actually i'm not going to school right now, my dream job is, to be a psychologist <laughter>, i'm not a psychologist, but what would make me do that is.., uh, to have experienced some challenges such as these, to have experienced some traumas, but i've always had an interest in it since the junior high of, um, uh, i am very interested in people and in the human interaction and in the human connection and, to make these things better.., bridging people and helping people in person through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges around, uh, so this is kind of about it in a summary, um, i think i'm someone who, i can be very outgoing and somehow a warm and friendly presence very light, but i think on <o> on the outside around, but i think i'm shy and i challenge to do that, i think i'm shy in my heart, but i challenge myself because i love human interaction, so i take these risks and jump and these challenges., the last time i interacted with someone was <laughter> today, when i think i understand your question right, oh no no anyway i think i'm misunderstanding your question, but i interacted with rachel around i'm just to interact continuously with people, take these risks, um, very good., mm, very good <laughter>, um, when was the last time i had a fight with someone?, i can't remember it wasn't new <laughter>, i have to think that i don't know yet., i draw an empty.. i can only remember things.., of when i was like twenty one <laughter> now, i can't think of anything contemporary right now., my mind is, okay, when i was younger, yeah, i lost it., a relationship with my aunt, and my uncle and my cousins, for when i was twenty one, i was forty five, um, i um, uh, uh, had a disagreement with my aunt and i said something that was uh critical, from her and, she threw me out of her house., and, uh, leave me back to uh i apologized immediately, and they left me in their lives, and changed her mind so, i regret that, um, i suppose you mean, how did i feel when they asked me never to be in their lives again?, and to leave, shattered soul shattered heart shattered, well, that was my family, the.., the good side of my family is around uh, the majority of my family, they were the loving aspect of my family, the rest of my family, is very cruel and how very abusive., i don't have a relationship with my family at all., how the, since i.., twenty one since my aunt and uncle., uh, denies me i think is the right word, estranged yes, um, i'm drawing an empty bear with me for a second., um, something i could erase., <laughter> i can't even remember it, um, uh as an example to, uh, i was hurt and i wish i could get that away from my memory, yeah, i know., i was injured in the er., , i went in for food poisoning., from a doctor around i had collapsed and, i was instructed to go to the e r because i said food poisoning and i came out with a neurological syndrome injured i was with an injured, what do you call that?, uh intravenous procedure uh and now i've got uh, r s d reflex like dystrophy, and it was the scene in the emergency room, it was a scene out of control, there was a problem with the procedure., and the doctor cried out to his staff, who made a mistake., um, eh and it was extremely painful around it was a crisis, and so every time i think about it, the injury and it was uh disfiguring i was disabled, um, for <f> i uh was disabled for it uh permanently around from it i was also around, uh hindered by my employment for quite a lot of quite a lot of time as well, and, and i have left it around, physical trauma of him and distortion and around, severe disability < disabil> disability limited by, um, functionality uh with my right my, i'm right handed uh with my right hand, and arm, thank you., i don't even know what that is., um, i, you know i really do., i apologize because i can't give you this., uh the most appropriate answer to, uh, i guess it had something to do with.., my cat and her, your urgent uh, um, what do you call it?, she was in intensive care and i'm sure it had something to do with it., um, but unlike that, i would say that i chose my way of life if, , um, and uh, i was admitted to this program., or if i went to art school for four years.., and i had to choose a way of life, but that's not a traumatic situation., i don't know how to answer your question., i can't., um, i just.., severe nightmares <laughter> and i have to be nocturnal, uh panic attacks, and i also have physical illness on it and i am in painful pain, yes, yes, yeah, they're triggered by the injury i told you., they're being triggered by my family., um, they treated me, what they told me, what they did to me., they're triggered by.., what else around mine around my physical illness not my injury only but my physical, sickness also, so yes., um, i feel very sick, and, feel so tired, very sick and very tired, um, when i don't sleep and sleep enough around uh my anxiety level i think is up and, i'm receptive to feeling depressed., um, so yes., yes, about three years ago around my latest um diagnosis, and in two thousand and one,, uh yes, um, three years ago and around, when i.., 20 years old, around the background of my childhood, from my family of origin around, and their around uh, you know the abuse i've been through., uh and her ultimate um uh, what's the word?, rejection from me and alienation, that was the first reason, um, no, i quit six months ago., <sigh> um, why did i stop to just take a break <laughter> i'll continue, yes very, it has helped tremendously, um, i think it helps with fear it helps with, um, it helps to inspire to create inspiration it helps to, um, uh feeling connected, to help create what i'm ultimately about my goal,, to give me a voice and to, um, uh it helps to do <d> to uh, it's part of this process., it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself., um, and anyway there are only as many advantages it is, i, i'll stop right away, there's a lot more., mhm, um, the last time i felt really happy, it was a really long time ago around it was before my illness, um and it was in nineteen ninety seven around the beginning of my illness was in july of ninety seven so it was around before that <laughter>, yeah., i was in a very good place, in terms of my career., in order to , um, just my relationships and um everything was kind of best around, career relations, personal fulfillment around somehow, also around i was very active and did, many things that were meaningful to build a life and i was in the process of, especially in the planning stages of my life, but also very successful, at the same time, so it was just things just went very well and around i just really liked uh, the place where my life was only in a really good place in many ways, mhm, i wish i could change about myself., i wish i could change for my agoraphobia., my p t s d around means my trauma around and around, uh, what else.., um, my insecurity, as far as.., uh, just.., with <w> with other people in the sense that i always try to make sure that, that i don't do something that.., wait a second., i'm just trying to make sure i don't do anything that offends or offends her., um, or uh is disrespectful uh and i feel like i'm too careful about it and uh, it will somehow be a fear for itself, so i definitely think that would be useful, to change the other thing i want to change about myself, i wish i could feel, and also depression that i want to change about myself. i wish i could feel better., i wish i wasn't feeling., um, um.., i don't wish i didn't have the burden i'm doing., my family doesn't have one., um, i wish i hadn't had my illness and the physical, um, agonizing pain i'm in, so these are some things.., and i also wish that, and this is a by product of p t s d i wish i hadn't had to, uh, symptomology, of p t s d, because this is definitely about, affects a complete <com> completely the complete life like anyway a lot of their impact on their life uh completely, and i wish i were more articulate, and i wish i was someone who was well spoken, and someone who is well written, but there are many more., things i wish i could change about myself to improve myself, so many more, <sigh> um, i'm not sure., < sniffle>, maybe not to be so trusting, i have faith., i trusted some doctors that.., you know, again caused the injury, and, you know that, there's a uh, what's the word?, there is an expectation and a kind of demand to live up to, blind trust for the medical profession and, <sniffle> um, don't ask any questions and just somehow change, you know, and when and not to trust your own self your own around your own instincts or intuition, and so i would, i would have told myself to be more careful., i guess if that's what it is, useful for your question, < sniffle>, what did i really like?, you know i can't figure anything out., but.., i know it should be.., either read or re read, connecting with someone on a meaningful level, < sniffle>, i'm very proud of.., my compassion, um, my around my uh empathy and caring for people, um, i mean, i'm proud of it., but also especially <sniffle> around i come from a, to an environment that is the opposite to a background and i was not taught that < sniffle> but i really care about the people and about, i'm very proud that i'm proud of my career, too., benefits, around and mine for perseverance around my grim <fie> my grim perseverance to be successful, to <sniffle> and uh, you know, just to get the power that it takes to get through, injury, uh living with it and living with the disease i live with the physical illness, um, so i think that's it., < sniffle>, yes, all right., you're welcome., see you.",9
467,", yeah, i'm fine with that., uh, i feel pretty good, little <l> little nervous, because i've never done anything like this before, that's why, < slaughter>, yeah, that's good., of ooio cincinnati, yeah, that's good., two months ago, two and a half months, i was just looking., just wanted to be in a new environment, oh, yeah, i'm ecstatic, very happy, uh it took a few weeks just to be adjusted, because i didn't know anyone., the weather is probably the best, yes and uh, i mean differently than that, it's pretty much the same as anywhere else i've been, there's nothing i don't really like about l a, it's just you know, only the weather is the best part of it, yeah, that's good., i like to travel, i didn't travel much in my life, but in the past., uh year and a half i've done, quite a trip made, only different places see different people new people new faces, new places, uh.., let's see, last summer i spent the uh summer in cleveland., < sniffle> in urban agriculture, in the city, yes and uh, i stayed in a hostel the first hostel in cleveland, , and, i did a program with the uh., , and it was basically, we will, go to various urban farms throughout the city and, voluntary, approx. 25 hours per week, so yes., really a spur of the moment kind of thing, um, i wanted to try something else i had never done before., and agriculture is one of those things you know most people, would never try, because you know, because of a certain stigmatization that's related to it., uh, and you know, i thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that., yeah, that's good., what in the uh, uh mm, urban agriculture or in general, in urban agriculture uh, i don't know, i guess uh, i don't know, only the general experience just go, you know, food uh go to the farmer's markets and eat all the fresh food and, only see the difference in, you know how fresh natural foods taste anyway you know, unlike the foods you buy in a grocery store, yeah, that's good., yes, it really is., i had two semesters., of uh college and i was undecided, so i only took general courses., my dream job, what are you doing?, i guess my dream job would be, <ss> everything that includes <invol> uh i don't have a certain dream job, but everything that concerns nature, i'm just outside., i'd like to.., i wouldn't mind being like a forest ranger or anything., as long as i know,, yeah, that's good., i think i'm more shy, i don't know why it's exactly like that., uh huh, i'm reading, um, listening to music, uh, i draw, watch movies like this, yeah, that's good., i think i'm pretty good at it., i think, <thi>, yeah, that's good., , yeah, i can't remember the last time i had a fight with someone., i don't know., <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth>, again i don't know, because, i don't know., about things that have happened in the past, yeah, that's good., < slaughter>, mm, maybe whether or not to come to california, i guess that was a tough decision., all right., i don't know that i've been thinking about it., you know you're moving to a new place for a long time, and <sigh> i guess, the hardest part of the decision was, think that , whether or not i was, safe or not, you know what i mean, um, just go to a new place where you don't know anyone, uh, it's kind of.., you really don't know what's going to happen., so, uh, there was a lot of uh, you know, anxiety in this, in this decision of the, should i go to a place where i don't know anyone i don't know?, you know, only, only perception has ever had <ha> that i have of this area, you know what i saw in the media and t v, so you know it, oh, yeah, i guess that was, difficultest decision i can imagine, yeah, that's good., oh, guess what., nothing absolutely nothing, yeah, that's good., uh, nothing, i don't feel guilty about anything., relationship with my family, i'm not very close to my family., i guess the person, i'm closest to my mother, but you know, i don't know that i never really talk to her much., uh, i don't know my father so well., you know, <makes click sounds with mouth>, < whistling soft>, < whistling soft>, uh, i guess my grandmother, yeah, her., yeah, she's.., she's very.., how should i say it uh, she's very, she's a thinker, i put it as if it were very instructive., so, um, yeah, i'm looking at her., for a lot of advice because, she's been through a lot in her life, and i feel like she knows she's been through a lot, so she understands a lot, so you know it, it is a very positive influence, very simple, uh, perhaps unsafe, i'd say, because, now i really don't know., in which direction i want to go with my life, and there was a lot of confusion with the, um, but, you know it's not, it's not something that overly affects me, but you know it's always a thought in my back of my mind, it feels like, somehow, maybe i'm running out of time, and i know it's not that it's not , that's not a realistic thought, because, i don't understand how you could run out of time., but, yeah, i guess so., only in general, don't know what i want, but i know how, how can i handle this?, how can i handle this?, i don't know that i'm thinking a lot about it., seeking a lot of soul, it's not hard, i mean, i mean, i'm, it's ., as i can't say, it's hard because it's one of those things that, i feel like it's necessary, and, you know certain things in life that you just, you're forced to turn yourself in., so, it's harder, i think it's harder to avoid, this kind of things, yeah, that's good., no, uh, today, when i was talking when i was talking to my friend., yeah, that's good., how would my best friend describe me, i guess he'd say i'm quiet., uh, uh, would he describe as a nice guy, uh, guesses instructive, mm, stupid., and, yeah, that's good., oh, i don't really think so, no, ten or twenty years ago, i guess i'd say,, stick with what i love, hmm, i did it., acting workshop, in order, , yeah, that's good., i don't know that it was always an interest of mine., and i decided why not, you know you're just gonna try it., see how you like it, on what i am most proud of, like an event or performance, i guess i'm proud to be independent., mm, yeah, that's good., see you.",0
468,", yeah, i'm fine with that., i'm pretty good to feel a little tired, but uh, feeling pretty good for most of it, around redondo beach, yep, i like the beach i like the mountains, love how to go surfing in the morning snowboarding in the day, um, i like walking in these mountains of santa monica mountains, to be exact, i don't like traffic, i don't like people's overload here., and i don't like it, the price of the cost of living in certain areas, i tried to really.., last year was the summer of, really street tripping and out with my girlfriend around, we want to go to costarica this summer and hopefully to south america and then maybe even take a road trip., see below in the south some of the southern states, but i was in canada, i was in mexico and ecuador., was in different countries here and there, try to get out of there, i love meeting new people, i love experiencing new things that try differently <diffing>, various foods that are native to this area, and, it's just part of the journey i love to explore what you know., this planet we call earth, just recently we went to seattle and canada with a few friends and uh, it was beautiful we uh flew in seattle, and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and, on the way to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy it was beautiful just, very lush beautiful trees the uh, the climate was nice the sea was right there it was the people were great it was just a fun trip all around, yeah, that's good., , was probably the uh, the trip we made to colorado last summer, and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver, and we didn't really have a plan that we knew we knew about some people who lived there and.., only the day before we contacted them and had to tell them we were coming to the area., and they were only shown great hospitality they brought us at the airport let us crash in their place for a few days we, let's even use your car to explore the state and go to wyoming and, see, the neighbors in the north it was just a great trip great people and, it was just everything worked very well just every day there was something new and fun to do, yeah, that's good., i uh i studied business administration, and uh economy at the moment, i've always wanted, own my own business and i thought management was a, a good uh foundation to build and uh learn more about it so i decided to just go into management, see the different aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and to, and then economy is just, just for long term investment i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e t fs and investment funds and, start buying my portfolio up, so i thought economy would be a good way to make a long term investment financially, so that's why i made my economy, yeah, i'm really excited it was, one of the best choices of my life, yeah, that's good., i consider myself more outgoing i am, i'm pretty friendly, i don't mind opening up to people and stuff., i like to be outside like walking, i like working at the gym, but.., i usually like to be outdoors i love nature and just be outside, i just feel good., of pretty good for most part i'm pretty gentle chill guy and when i get angry here and there, i don't know., it only takes a few minutes and before i know it, i just blow about i tend not to hold on to things or stay, angry and resentment, just because, there is no need, life is too short for all this, um, i can't even remember when i was arguing with someone., i have no idea., probably when my uh, my brother and my girlfriend came in a little, little argument, like two birthdays ago and it's kind of embarrassing since, i wish i'd taken care of it., right then and there, instead of letting it just stretch out as long as it's been, it's just embarrassing for both parties, i wish i'd only communicated with both of them and, said to them, you know, set aside their differences and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution, but now it's just, inconvenient, yes, it does., the hardest decision i've ever had to make, man who's tough, i don't think i've had too many., hard decisions to really say the toughest decision i ever had to make to, maybe, not to colorado for my undergrad, two three years ago, was a little hard just because i kind of think what if, but nothing else was really too hard in my life that, was really so hard of a decision, i don't feel guilty about anything., pretty good person i think and for the most part, i couldn't figure anything out., something i could wish i could erase from my memory., nothing to be really honest i, i love all my memories they are usually positive for most, i know it's kind of, strange to say for someone, but i've lived a pretty good life and, i'm happy, yeah, that's good., i'm usually quite independent, so when i see her here and there it is., we go through long times without contact maybe a few weeks sometimes even a month, but when i see her, it's, it's good that you know that i like to say hello and show them that i still love them and, it's not like i don't want me to contact her, they could always contact me, but.., it's good for most i think as a young adult, mm, the family of my girlfriend uh, they were very positive in my life, if it wasn't for them, i would go in another direction., just because i didn't care so much about high school., really long term thinking, and uh just to see her and, what their family does and, how they think differently, how with your higher education and how to go somewhere in life and what if you do these things, this is what it could lead to,, and they were very successful they own their own uh, accounting practice and, see that influences me to reach higher ones in life, yeah, that's good., it's pretty easy for most of me just close my eyes and, wake up in the morning, i'm tired, sometimes i'm tired, could feel that i'm a little drained and uh, maybe a little groggy here and there, and that's it., feel pretty good for most of it a little bit, stressed just because the finals are uh next week, and uh i want to do really well and only you know, close this last semester and i graduate in two weeks, and, for the most part, that's the only thing i'm really nervous about, but for the most part, i'm really excited about, i'm going to be fired for a week after graduation maui i'm, see what the future holds, where we will live <l> me and my girlfriend will live and, what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just happy to be finished with school for a while, yeah, that's good., i have never been diagnosed with p t s d, i have never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>, the last time i felt really happy was likely to see my girlfriend graduation a few days ago she uh just graduated from nursing school on monday, and uh seeing her go over stage and all that just because we've been together for six years and they're going through, the care programme for five and, it's just, seeing all the ups and downs is really good to see that someone simply strives through and achieves what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of them., yeah, that's good., probably outgoing friendly, positive vibes all around, adventurous, loves sport, team player knows how to be a leader here and there, and uh, is a little open sometimes, no not really for the most part, no, not really., just a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just, maybe because i'm done with school right now and i'm over feeling that i just don't feel so motivated, but i just want to be more motivated and determined, now and that's not, i'm not going that far now., mhm, no biggie, <sigh>, oh, man, i couldn't, i can't think of any more time., i dug two weeks ago., that was a lot of fun, we went to sequoia national park and i went with a, for a r t m class it's like this uh recreation tourism management class and cave research was an elective subject and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he brought us to these various caves in uh, sequoia and only, me and these strangers or my classmates and getting really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and climbing back into caves through various rooms and slides, it was a lot of fun., that was, yeah, that's good., ten or twenty years ago, i'd say i'd focus more on school., slightly less on the social aspects, and uh, somehow to hold with a sport just to see how far that could get you, to <sigh>, sometimes don't play hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and around, and that's pretty much it now, i'm proud that i'm really proud that i'm doing my bachelor's degree and i'm, looking for a full time job i work at a law firm now, so i have something to do for myself, i'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person in the long term <w> long term thinking wise i'm a well rounded person, and i really want to explore the world, so i'm kind of proud that i've opened my eyes and now i have different perspectives and, really have an open mind for people and instead of judging them, you know it's freedom why not let them do what they want, and uh, i am really proud to finally get my bachelor and hopefully go to my m b a in a few years., safe, see you.",4
469,", yes, i'm fine., oj l 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1., mm, there's a lot of variety, there's a lot of health oriented stuff., there are all kinds of food you can eat in the desert you can go to, you can go anywhere i mean, there are a lot of, and the weather is great, transport in order to , lately the change of the weather is somehow a little too unpredictable, but it is mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of the people, i wouldn't say much, just occasionally., uh it's nice to do a change of scenery and different things that maybe i wouldn't normally do different people around, learning about different people different customs around, depends on it, i mean, if there is a water really pretty water and you know that in beautiful water around, relaxing, adventure i love adventure, uh <laughter> uh some time ago i went to cayman islands and around, i went seasick, but my sister gave me medication and i went on a boat and we snorted and there were two boats and i accidentally got back on the wrong boat, um, yes and they're really crazy, they let me jump back into the water and let me swim to the right boat <laughter>, and i thought i was drowning because the water was pretty rough, i was really shocked that they wanted me to., yes, but i survived <laughter>, yeah, pretty good., uh management, but also, also hypnotherapy, i didn't hear that other question., um, well, i came from a serious arta family, so that seems just something that would be universal that would cover a lot of different topics, yes, yes, but by yes and no, i mean now, i kind of wish it was something else, i like communication i love speaking and interviewing strangers, i'm very extraordinary and funny., probably something like either liberal art communication would have been this kind of thing, uh dream job would be just out there you know how some of these people might explore on t v different places and always paid for it and anyway always like a fun adventure, uh interacts with people, to do things i haven't done yet, and, helping people, you know in a way with what i do that you can see that you know, that i am uncoordinated and in a way and you know that they may be uncoordinated and also have fun <laughter>, uh i watch t v i go work out around i walk i recently got like a bike that i somehow set up a kind of, to do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping, interaction with friends call them see them, this kind of thing, talking to strangers, um, depends on the situation, there are a number of times when i'm good at it, when it comes to traffic and cars, it's a little more intense for me, it's a little harder for me., or people who are like really rude, you know with the way they cut you off, almost <laughter>, luckily not, you know, i'm very persuasive and maybe too much sometimes, where when someone gets something really rude with me in a parking lot i get, i'll confront her sometimes., um, maybe i was with my sister., it had to do with the subject, but whatever she said was not right and we have in an argument it sounds childish about who was right, you know, because she thinks she's always the smarter because she's older, sometimes it's frustrating because it's like it's not a profit situation she just wants to attach to someone until you know that they realize she's right., um, other times, i just let it go and let it clap because it, it's kind of not productive., i'm really close to seeing my parents almost every weekend, more close to my mother., i have a twin sister, i'll stay in touch with her even though she's not in town, she's out of town, and i have two other sisters, so i'll stay in touch with her., all of them, you know it's a mixed bag you know., we somehow have a self confident aggressiveness in us a little bit, <sigh>, but also, um, well, i'm, uh, i'm, uh, i'm, uh, i'm, uh.., i mean strangers, sometimes my family, you know they did nice things for me., foreigners were, very to sometimes unexpected very nice, i could go shopping and you know i'm, maybe i can't reach something, and a guy shows up behind me, and you know, without me saying anything, just help me.., that kind of thing or.., if someone is mean to me, someone likes, commit <laughter> you know and to, , um, i had a situation with a neighbor years ago, where he was really angry with me, because he thought i, you know, i'm not crazy about dogs, but he freaked out for a year and a half, and.., i wish i'd seen that when other people weren't there., because i, you know, but it caused a lot of fear for me because i feel like i could have nipped it in the bud and instead of me with the.., main load of him, now he and i aren't talking at all, i think it's best that he's kind of weird., hmm, god, there was a lot, um, sometimes break up with someone or.., <sigh>, yes, it's usually or get rid of a friend, this kind of thing, um, sometimes i feel guilty about, some of my previous behavior with people around, where i may not have been so understanding.., when i was younger, i stole things that you know is not the best behavior, and.., and it's like this stuff, oh, god, there's a lot of them around, i wish i could erase you., hard my father was on us as children, and, delete a lot of memories of men i use with that just doesn't work well at all, and, yeah, that's good., i can run away like, now, yeah, that's good., curly <laughter> irritated around, schnarky <laughter>, um, i was afraid of money and relationships because i haven't been in one for so long., male <laughter>, just a lot of fear around, yeah., sigh> take a deep breath around, try and do positive things that you sometimes know, to eat healthier work more to talk to my friend about it, this kind of thing, try and look for interesting activities to do, to distract me, < sniffle>, good not official but i know you know about, things i've experienced that i've had, i know that i'm getting very scared in certain situations, yeah, it's usually triggered by.., sometimes when someone gets really angry and crazy, it causes a lot of fear in me when they're aggressive, whether it's physical or verbal, uh or sometimes if they're too much in my room < s> my uh room you know where i am it bothers me, yeah, a long time ago., it's been a long time., maybe over ten years ago, 15 years ago, um, i was depressed <laughter> i mean <laughter> i know there's nothing to laugh about, but i mean, it's kind of, in a circle around, only, to the, wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more, um, feeling stuck in certain thoughts, a lot of negative thoughts about feeling hopelessness helplessness, this kind of thing, , um, i go occasionally, it's another guy around, i will go to a hypnotherapist, sometimes to release <rel> <rel> fear that is inside me, yes i do very useful, um, much more awareness for me and other people, learning more control more confidence to better self esteem to willy to try, even more things you know, whether i know the result or not, you know about the unknown, i'm going to experiment a lot more, , um, help like the twenty five miles of water and there were some people who did it for the first time, an event at my sister's, where there were only a few of us and.., i cracked a lot of jokes sometimes i'm like really funny you know, and i can't even believe even you know that i'm just going on and on, you know, everybody starts laughing, i don't even try and i just say like normal stories and people look at me funny and laugh, yeah that, to be truly decent loyal uh empathetic around, earn, um, supporting i hope <laughter> to, out of quirky, type of person, um, good it would be great, uh look even younger uh or be younger, if the human was possible <laughter> around, be more patient with people, i think you know you're not getting frustrated like i think someone's not very smart., sometimes it's really frustrating for me to be with some types of people., whoa um <laughter>, oh,, make a lot of money and plan for your future, um, and, try and be as friendly and patient with people as possible and have a lot of fun trying new things, i think of my mind and my perseverance,, i've changed a lot of things in my personality., uh i feel proud of volunteering i helped <hel> i feel proud i've helped, lots of people lose weight declutter their homes around me have helped to make a lot of positive changes in people, mhm, oh, all right., yeah, it was nice talking to you., see you.",3
470,", yes, i'm fine., i'm out of los angeles california, the food the weather and the people, mm, um, i don't know that there aren't too many things i might not like about l a., some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in l a, < slaughter>, not too much, i was just like texas las vegas and, that's pretty much all., mhm, um, catching a plane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my father, and, go to read vegas a lot, this is, oh, yeah, good., when i was younger, i went to my father and because he lived in houston texas and i often caught the plane, and that was a lot of fun i wasn't afraid that was a lot of fun, and i enjoyed that <laughter>, when i went to school, i studied child development and nursing., um, i know i wanted to be someone, and when i went to school, i wasn't sure what i wanted to be., so i first maintained the l v n program., and then i didn't want to be a nurse, so i changed my main subject to child development and i graduated., no, i'm actually looking for work. i'm unemployed right now., my dream job would be, probably work with the children who open a nursery or something that is my own business, in my head it's simple, but as in reality it seems like it's kind of difficult <laughter>, sometimes i'm shy, but i'm really an outgoing person and a human person, hmm, < slaughter>, to relax, i listen to slow music that i kind of like., have a quiet environment, and maybe lie down a little t v or something, i'm very good at controlling my temperament, i don't like getting really angry or angry, or, come to the place where, i'm fit to hurt someone <laughter>, um, if i really have arguments that they are because people don't agree to contradict., and then it's over how really petty it is like, we could say oh, it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion, so we're arguing about it, but there's nothing really big or something like that that it's just stupid, i don't even remember <laughter>, um, i need a job <laughter>, yes, um, maybe <sigh>, i don't really remember a situation i'm trying to really think about before i really do a situation and i'm trying to handle it in my best positive way, before i really do something i regret, to be with someone like a guy you know when i want to continue a relationship with them., or just, to be single, mm, um, my relationship with my family that i don't have, i just stay with my dad and i have a daughter, and we just stay close to my whole family, they're either in.., houston texas, or, they're close, but i'm not joining many of my family., my father, because i'm living with him right now, i might have lived with him for five to six years., and, he's just the only one i really look up to, i don't really have anyone around me to look up to, and, that's it <laughter>, , she's in fifth grade, she's graduating, she's in sixth grade, and i'm kind of excited about it., sometimes it's easy, but uh sometimes it gets a little overwhelming, the hardest part about being a parent is being a single parent., it's just that you always have someone who brings you joy, i always enjoy things to do with my daughter, it's all about making a lot of sacrifices and just always, it brings me so much joy to be a parent, all right., to my parents when i was younger, they, lived apart, so my mother, i don't know that i'm a much better parent because i'm more interested in what my child wants to do, i'm involved in her life, they only take every step, i'm really fully involved my parents wasn't really that you know they had a drug problem, so it's easy, i had to mature much faster than many other children, so, it was, um, only, my parents and.., her drug addiction i wish i could erase this from my memory, to cope with them now, well, when i grew up, it was just rough, it was very rough., had to do a lot of things on your own, they weren't involved in my choices in life., i didn't know how i really grew up and be a child and what way to go or anything it was easy as if i was alone in a world, yeah, that's good., oh it's very easy i sleep well every night i can sleep whenever i sleep very well, um, a little sad but most of the time i'm very happy i'm just not happy with where i'm in my life right now, um, not really i really try to think very positively and try what i can do every day to look for work and, just stay positive and focused, no, i didn't., no, i didn't., the last time i felt very happy was when i finished college, i felt very happy that this was one of the best things that happened in my life and, that was the last time i was really very happy., i felt like i was on top of the world i felt like, only, overwhelmed by joy only, everything was just so exciting for me that day i was just very happy nothing could upset me that day i was very happy and when i think about that day it just, it's a very happy experience for me, um, right now, i don't really have a best friend., i'm really trying, i'm, i tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they didn't really make a lot of positive decisions, so right now i'm just like, um, i really don't have any friends right now., for my personality, um, i'm, a happy person i am an outgoing person, and, a positive person, and, a good mother, around uncertainties like around sometimes i feel like, i have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something i feel like i can't get through something i can't., sometimes come to the next step or, only, malaise, sometimes, well, i had a girlfriend and she was like bipolar, and i tried to really be her friend, no matter the illness she had, but, she wasn't a really good friend because she, one day she started., only, um, to be very negative and just to talk about me as if we were enemies and everything and, it didn't really feel bad about me, but it just made me choose my friends very smart, yeah just friends with certain people who don't have positive things with themselves or just, not only when i notice things about people who should determine whether i want to be their friend or not, you know that maybe she, bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that this is a red flag and i shouldn't be this one, friends <laughter>, yeah, that's good., to stay in school, stay positive and stay focused and surround me with good positive people, and only, stay on the right track, well, i left., to a friend's house that i haven't seen since childhood., and they, there were only a lot of people over there., and they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed seeing my old friends i didn't see in a long time, and just with, my family and, certain friends i really enjoyed because i'm really always in the house i really don't go out so often, so i enjoyed it, with, a group of friends and family and enjoy themselves, yeah, that's good., i'm proud of you., the, i got my g e d i graduated., and i want to be someone and i'm very proud that i want to be a better parent than my parents, thank you very much <laughter>, goodbye.",3
471,", yes, i'm fine, thank you., from los <l> los narrowes, mm sports outdoors, surfing uh snowboarding mountain biking climbing, transport, yes, experience different cultures, i love going to mexico., and uh anyway it's so much different from california and western culture, so to say, mexico is a western civilization, but, the height of the, entertainment and level of education is so much different that they are like two different worlds, traveling you mean, uh, i would have to say to go to an island off the coast of figi, the name is tavarua, and it is a very small island around which you can walk in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes, and it's a place where you go to surf and it's an incredible, uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place, i've studied biology, i was pushed from behind by my father, who was a doctor, and he wanted me to be a doctor., i don't work at all in, business units now, yes, i am., my dream job would be to be a missionary, yes, the original goal of my father, when he became an m d, was to become a missionary and he is a very, generous person and i think i'm also i got that from him uh hereditary, but i'd like to help people, and i don't think a doctor helps people, i really don't think it's insincere to say that you help people while you stuff wads of money in your pocket., i'd like to build uh people houses and help them find freshwater springs things like this if i could afford to travel to remote places like this, i'm practicing, i think i'm pretty good at it uh, i think i'm pretty effective at that., it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend, and it was about their lack of consideration, um, i felt frustrated, hmm, a situation which , i wish i could handle it differently., i anyway in my later years i would say anyway i didn't have many regrets in my younger years i uh, people are sniffed and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i wouldn't express my dissatisfaction about their actions or behavior, i would just close my mouth and internalize my feelings that i learned that, it's so wrong, and so, in the probably last fifteen to twenty years i have made it to a point to my vocalize, dissatisfaction with someone's actions immediately and that, uh takes care of the anger right away, yeah, it depends on what you mean with trouble, uh i think, anyway all the way around as soon as you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end, it diffuses the problems rather than, prolonged or delayed the disturbance, i go back it would be not to pursue uh medicine as my father wanted us to argue, length for many, months and years over this and uh finally i've overwhelmed and uh i don't go, i didn't go on this route, but that was probably the most.., uh difficult period, in my life, mm there was a time when i wish i could erase a female interaction uh friends and their, uh betrayal uh but now i realize that, keeping these memories makes me who i am today and, and dealing with them defines who i am today, uh my parents died i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very grateful for the, although my father was a little bit a uh, hard hand uh, and draconian < laughter> person uh we came to an understanding long before he died, and uh my brothers i get along well with my younger brother, but my older brother has problems he has uh psychological problems and she continues to plague and influence him, me, too., just knowing he's going through uh turbulence, well, i guess i can't handle it because.., he's clinically depressed., and he has suicidal tendencies, and he doesn't work, he's very educated., and he's not talking to me., and his family abuses him very much, it's a not happy relationship for his family, yes, you know, i'd have to say my father's my hero, he's my model., he's my archetype for what a man was supposed to be, and he was inconspicuously honest., and kind,, but on the other hand he had high expectations of me and my two brothers., eh normally, once my head hits the pillow i'm dead sleeping like a tree trunk, but lately i just uh last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two, and i feel it's because of a cancer diagnosis i received a month ago, um, i using my own personal uh methods of dealing with stress, i'm okay i'm probably 90 percent okay, ten percent of uncertainty about the future, on the question of whether , i'm gonna survive this or not, not really, no, never, never, oh i was either surfing or snowboarding, or climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i train at a very high level of effort, funny, jovial, uh uh intelligent a perfectionist, no one asked me that., maybe, will my uh submerge, hedonistic self, i look at myself again, my father fills my consciousness, he was the ultimate.., uh postponer of satisfaction, he, set, now behind him and he put what will be in the future, in his eyes, and he never let go of it, and that made him the self made man he was., considering that i am always looking for the present, how i feel now and it's difficult for me,, uh slog through a mile full of uh shit to get at a price that's so far away, < deep breath> it would be, my ex boss, and he started using me on my last day of work when he fired me, he started using me, i turned to him and i said you can't talk to me like that., and he continued to use more profanity, to uh, i spoke out against it again, and then he fired me, and that's still in my head, and that's what happened., a year and a half ago, mhm, everything i regret uh yes i don't regret getting married and having children, i suppose i could, but i think that, that would have taken away the many opportunities i had, and i took to travel the world and experience different cultures because, that's what i enjoy most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my consciousness, for the united states are not the end of the world, but only when one can travel can one find out that we are not., we have not been going to, uh level of uh life around the world other people think that we're the only ones who think that and i don't agree, mm, that's a good one i'd say, <laughter> i'd say just enjoying life because you never know when it's coming to an end and i think i've done that, and uh i could come to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so, i think i've done it, i'm so happy with my life, i, has been, climbing lessons i have a uh part time task of teaching climbing, and many of these people have never done it before, and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this could have changed their lives so, that was very gratifying to me, < deep breath>, i would say <sigh> my, devotion to, environment, i wasn't always an environmentalist, but.., i used myself vocally for being an ahem., uh, a steward., the environment, because today they are a lot of people who, environmental pollution with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septically uh things like this and, i get up and i've been talking on t v and on uh youtube against these people who pollute the

family <fam>, for work, yeah, i love it here, it took me about a year to feel really comfortable, but, um, once that came through this kind of hard year, it was pretty good out here i've had a good time, for the, love that i can go to the beach, i love that it's warm most of the time., i love that i've met a lot of people who love the arts as much as i do., traffic just like any other, um, yeah, that's good., yes, the traffic and, it's pretty much just traffic, earthquake, not as much as i want, it's just nice to go to a new place., experience something else, around i went to alaska a few years ago and that was really awesome, i have to go fishing in the ocean and i got seasick, that wasn't great, but uh, it was cool i saw a bear in real life a bear walked through a yard, it was really different than it was really cool, < slaughter>, english creative writing, i've always wanted to tell stories., it just made sense to work on writing in some way, yes, i am., to, have my own t v show where i write it and everyone looks at it every week and it's awesome, really hard, because there are a lot of people who have the same dream., yeah, that's good., more outgoing than shy, i like talking to people, i enjoy other people, go to the movies or, turn on music dance, pretty good, around <sigh> it was at work couple about a month ago <ag> about a month ago, um, i've got, angry with someone because i didn't think they gave me clear instructions, and when i tried to have a conversation about it, they got angry and then i got angry and, we got crazy, i felt like i wasn't being heard or heard and, i felt that we were not able to have a real dialogue., because we couldn't have a dialogue, i felt like no one was listening to me., total, um, <makes sounds with mouth>, i don't know., i i um, no, no <laughter> regrets <laughter>, i guess.., hmm, i don't know if there's one, i mean, i'm sure there's one, but, once i went after someone, and they cut me off., and, i think it was just one of those days, like a year ago or two years ago., it was just one of those days when i just didn't want to., or i was just a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got into an accident with them, i just followed them to their parking lot, and, actually, i pissed on her and they pissed me off., and so it really came to me under the skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh, and then turn me off, so i followed them to the place and i asked, i told miss, why did you turn me off when you cut me off?, and she said oh you know i'm, i had a hard day, i don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well that you're not really a good example for your daughter and you know,, i didn't have to be so petty, but i just wanted to, i guess i wanted to be., oh, hi., <laughter>um, oh, i guess the hardest decision was to come to my mom's uh, to tell her that i was gay, i mean, it wasn't hard because it was the right one, but it was hard to do because my mother was very conservative and she, she had difficulty accepting it and it took a while, but once she knew everything was better and i knew it would be, but it was hard at the moment,, you know you're telling her something she didn't want to hear., all right., um, when i was a little kid, my.., my grandfather found our dog run over on the road, and he uh, , and brought it in and i think i just remember when i was a kid, to see death like this, really only, threw me away and, uh scared me and, it was just one of those moments for which i guess i wish i hadn't been there because my grandmother was destroyed, she was just so sad, and uh, it was just one of those moments that i think you need as a child, but i didn't really want to experience like loss in your face, yeah, that's good., my relationship with my family is pretty good around, we're probably not as close as most but uh we, you know that we always, we don't talk often, but we talk with love and we, always love each other when we see each other, um, my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me, to uh you know, pursue my dreams and, not to let the little things get me down, so i'm glad i had them, usually it's easy, sometimes it's not, um, well, i've been between jobs recently i'm starting a new job uh next week, but, while i was away while i wasn't working, i tend to, my body wants to stay up later and later and i try not to like, fall into the pattern of walking to sleep like two or three and rise like eleven, so i try to let myself sleep by midnight or twelve thirty., and i just end up lying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half, when i should, i should be able to just sleep and get up like nine, but, i guess i still want to stay up., uh a little scattered, like today i'm a little scattered, because uh, i tried to go to sleep early and i ended up throwing and turning and, so <sigh> scattered <laughter>, now that i had a lot of time on my hands, as if i didn't usually have so much time on my hands, it can sometimes be frustrating because, you don't know what to do with it if you don't work., but, yeah, that's good., i think that answers the question, to me just that maybe a little more absent than usual just lately with uh the not working thing, no, mm, a few days ago when i got my new job when i was hired, um, outgoing listening, uh attentive, um, fun, loyal, i think, i hope, i wish that i, i wish i looked better. i wish i had more hair up here mm and would have lost it a little bit., uh probably wish i was a little skinnier that, this belt is quite tight <laughter> and around, you know, sometimes i wish i had more money, but.., nothing too drastic, i'm fine., yeah, that's good., oh, uh,, when i was a little kid, i was the fat kid., and, god i remember i was like going to high school, and it was like the second day, and i remember this guy came to me and was, um, how he was like pretty nice to me i thought, and i didn't know that he, as if it were from a movie, just like he had put bandaids on my back, who said i was a fat cow., and said how uh like, yeah, that's good., like a bunch of mean things and i didn't know it and i walked around with him for half an hour i heard people laughing and i didn't get it and then finally this girl just came to me and was like hey, there's like bandaids on your back saying all these mean things and then she just walked away, she didn't want to help me take them away, and i remember how i couldn't get it, i tried to find it and then, um, i just remember how to put my head in my locker and how, i didn't want anyone to see me cry, so i put my head in my locker., and as if i were looking at things in my backpack, but really i was you know, the crying fat child who couldn't get the mean stickers from his back, yeah., anything, um, likely, yeah, that's good., <sharp inhalation>, um, you know, i would i would try to keep, i would try to let myself know to look at things positively and not like worrying about what other people think about you, i think i spent too much time like a teenager, worrying what people thought of me, and when i got older, i didn't care so much and i started to enjoy life so much more, uh i went to coachella it's a music festival it's been three days with, all my friends and my friend and we, uh we danced and we went swimming and we grilled and we laughed and had a great time, yeah, that's good., oh, um, i guess my, my career modest as it may be, i really spend a long time in l a, when it was uh, when it was hard i stayed < stay> i stayed around i didn't stop so, you know, i'm proud that i managed to follow my dreams and really stay out here and, try to do it in hollywood, it's my pleasure., see you., see you., see you.",4
475,", yes, thank you., el segundo right down the street, the beach, the smog, i try when i have time, away from home coming away, i recently went to palm springs with my wife and friends and it was really nice, it was a hundred degrees outside and we laid by the pool and grilled, um, i'm not sure, probably graduating from college maybe, uh, i was the first person in my family to graduate, i guess from college, so it's a big deal., uh advertising communication and public relations, well, i've got, in the junior college i did to communicate around a lot of public speaking courses so, i went on and moved to a university and.., wanted to learn the same thing, i guess, yeah, i'm working in advertising now., < deep breath>, dream job, likely to be, work for a, a large golf company, and make their advertising for them, to, i'm definitely not shy maybe, um, it seems like it's just because i'm not different., a new attitude, but usually starting, , i run and like being outside i surf a lot, so every time i'm stressed, i'm definitely just, try to go to the gym or, wake up and surf before work, i don't really have a temperament, i'm pretty gentle, have not really been arguing with someone we have uh inconsistencies you know with family members or friends, but, it's usually uh solved right then and there, mm, i'm not sure., maybe not uh, to care for my family as much as i would like to imagine, i'm not sure i'm up on my head., it's pretty good, we're all pretty close father mom sisters brothers woman, in laws siblings yes yes all pets, probably my father., he's a hard worker., and he's kind of trained me to do that,, doing the same is the same way, that's one thing i definitely get a good night's sleep with, but it's hard to sleep with., something about the years of sleep deprived of insomnia <insom>, a little insomnia i mean it's getting better now that i'm getting older, i trained my body to go to bed one, but when i was younger, there were two three four in the morning., i feel okay., happy, mm i mean a bit right now, just because uh, my wife <w> my wife is uh pregnant so i'm slow <s> slowly feeling a little bit of the uh the side effects i guess, yes as i mean, i feel a little down here and there, but at the same time i said i just go to the gym or go for a longer run, you know, because she's healthy, we're healthy, you know everything's good and all, but, you're supposed to have the side effects of pregnancy, so i'm not familiar with the feelings., this morning when i woke up, no, have not been taking place, <sigh>, i have to meet some friends and play golf and enjoy the sunshine., as outgoing and, to work hard and, a family <f> good family person, maybe just to, have a little more trust, um, yeah, that's good., <deep breath> i don't remember <sigh>, not really trying to have no regrets, just forward from something uh, negative i guess uh, just try to keep going, to go to school to stay in school., invest early start a four o a k early, all the all the things you know, start a pension fund, all the above, just.., to be raised by a good family and to, to make me a hard worker, and, to be enough for <t>, working hard enough workers to take care of my family and hopefully be uh, success of one day and around, c e o my company at the moment i'm you know at the end of my advertising agency, but, further uh work harder and move up <m>",6

477,", yes, thank you., thank you, how are you?, i grew up in oklahoma, mhm, i moved to i a five and a half years ago, so i used to be in the west on the east coast and then i decided to come here., my home town not very often around most of my family moved away so i visit them, but i didn't really go back to oklahoma much, < sniffle>, oklahoma is quite different around, uh l a is much more exciting, there is much more to, to do here and to, uh the sea is obviously very nice so, um, you know that's a good question., i wanted to try something new and i always loved the beach and, i thought uh and i also like big cities, so i thought l a could come a good place for me, very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i've ever made, < slaughter>, pretty easy i think around anyway it seems kind of natural, it seemed like a good fit, i just really like it here., oh, it's great, i've got some roommates and we're really getting out of here i live a few blocks from the beach, every day i can walk on the beach or, you know, hanging out with friends, and it's just like being on vacation all the time, it's really nice., mm, i studied philosophy and political theory and government, and made a little english literature on the page, um it, i think it just happened., i went to liberal art school and got a kind of exposure to a lot of different, areas and, i simply followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that, um, not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit, so i work with graduates <grad> with graduates around in the social sciences and humanities, but i don't really use my philosophy background very often., <laughter>um, you know that i actually studied to become a success coach, so, i work with students is a kind of nicer, aspect of doing, but i would really like to work with others <o> with other people so not only students, but to help them achieve their goals and realize their dreams, i'd say it's pretty hard in the sense that, um, you know, it can be a challenge for people, actually, are motivated and do all the work that is required to, made to realize their dreams, but and it is also a challenge because there is a life in it, uh requires the collection of money so to find people who are willing to pay for it can also be difficult, i'm definitely on the shy side i'm an introvert so, i'm pretty good at a situation with people, but if you get me in a group with more than a few people, i'm very much an observer, so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not so engaged, and i think this is, something that goes it is noticed by others and it is perhaps a little strange for them especially if they are not introverted, so i would say, and it's also a challenge for me, i tend not to be the person who imagines himself in a room full of strangers., <laughter> pretty good, i think, but i have a temperament so i can get upset from time to time., not really around it can be a challenge when i drive < laughter> but other than that no, hmm, hmm, i'm not sure., it would probably have been a discussion about politics., and it would probably have been a friendly argument, um, probably with one of my liberal friends so, but i can't remember the appointed time, < slaughter>, < sniffle>, mm, i'm meditating, for the, do it almost every day, i also go to the beach i love the sea and i like the sounds and just out there is very peaceful, and i like to read and am alone with my thoughts, that's nice., mm, let me think about it for a second., <sigh>, hmm, <laughter> i have a hard time coming with everything i mean, i'm sure there are many things around, simply nothing comes to mind <sniffle>, <sigh>, hmm, okay, i'm sorry <laughter>, hmm, well, that's not exactly an event, it's a dream and it's not special, go to traumatic dream as far as dreams, but, i have it sometimes., probably more often than i want so that i wouldn't be upset if it, do you know if i didn't have it?, um, and it's just a version of a dream i think a lot of people probably have, but.., i'm usually in school somewhere., at the end of the semester, i didn't go to class to do the exams, i'll fail., and, you know really unhappy about why not i, learn and attend class as i should, um, that was actually no problem for me at school, but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating, and i'm not quite sure, why i mean, i know why, but i don't know what it's about, because it's not like i'm consciously worried, at least about the failure things so, no, i don't think so., at least not that i'm aware of it., < sniffle>, i feel guilty, i have a brother and a sister in law and a nephew., and they live on the east coast, and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and around, i lived there when he was younger., to spend a lot of time with them and, since i was in california, and especially last year, i've spent a lot less time trying to, for example, i saw her for a week at christmas and then i went back, in <i> at the beginning of may, so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i had seen her, and that i felt bad because, we enjoy each other's company and he, you know, i really like being there, but then he gets angry when i go and he asks when i'm coming back., so this is.., that makes me bad sometimes, mm, um, well, i have a brother, i'm very close to him, he's younger., and, he's four and a half years younger., he's married, i have a nephew., my two parents died., so it's just the two of us and we have a large, extended family, but we're not that close to most of them., um, on my father's side is a brother, um, and he's married and has a couple of kids, so i have some cousins on this side, but then on my mother's side there's, <sigh> five <fi> four or five other children, most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on this site, but they live throughout the country and around, so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook around and there a few i talk to on the phone and visit from time to time, but you know we're not so close to our extended family, um, i would say well, i mean, i have a lot of friends that i think were positive influences, , when i came to california, um, i started at a non profit work and it was kind of a strange place, it was very different from what i was used to, it was a bit challenging and she also worked there so, we worked on a joint program over the summer and got to know each other and, we have just built up this really strong friendship and, she's kind of, i'd say, my best friend probably here and probably only in general, and now she's moved to vegas, which is a bit tough for me., but we're going to napa this weekend, so it should be good, but she was a very good woman, because when i came here and didn't really know anyone, she was very positive., and you know, since i'm an introverter, it's not that easy for me to make friends, it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know, i think she's kind of bringing me, so it's a lot of fun hanging out with her and that was nice, i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy around, sometimes i know you know., depending on how long i'm awake < clears throat> i can get hurt < wou> a little upset and so sometimes i need to take a while to decompress, but, i usually meditate right before i go to bed and that's very helpful, um, and i can sleep, uh, you know, i sleep generally in 90 minute cycles., so, you know, usually six or seven and a half hours, but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination, i don't usually wake up in the middle of the night., or at least if i don't remember, so, well, i don't actually sleep very well when i travel, is one of the things i do for work, that i travel, a little bit, because i work for a company that's in the east, so i work from home, most of the time but then i travel, like a week in a month, and when i travel, i take the red eye, um, and then i'm going to visit with many friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i, sleep, bad or bad it's just that i don't have so much time to sleep, and on the first day, after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay, but usually the second day is not very good, so i get much tireder uh and it's harder to concentrate, and, i don't know it feels like a fight., i'd say good., um, summer is a little <l> is a busy time for the organization i work for, so i'm a little, i don't know if stress is the right word, but i know i'm a little worried., everything is going well this summer, but in general i feel pretty good, i can't think of anything., there's one thing i'm fighting for with exercise as i like walking around a lot, and i wander with friends and, to i was really motivated to go for a few months, but then i went away to the east coast and when i came back, i was much less motivated, because i didn't really train when i was there., and i had been out of habit, although it was only about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try to get back into the routine and it's not as good as i want, it's okay., thank you., no, no, all right., , he's having a lot of fun and, he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and, we're going to make a book club now, so we're going to skype and, maybe i get more time with him so but uh just being around him is fun, hmm, <sigh>, she'd probably say i know how to have fun., but that i can be serious, and, that i know you care about others, uh, and that i'm loyal, and, i'm not sure what else, um, i think those are probably the most important things., < sniffle>, i wish i had more self discipline, so, um, i wish you knew i could diet or eat healthier foods and not have a problem, uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar, i wish i wouldn't postpone because i got much better about it, but i still do, and that can be a challenge, um, and i wish i.., , i don't know., uh, i think i wish i was in a relationship, so, probably those things, mm, hmm, so at the last organization i worked with, i had a boss and she was, i don't feel like she's.., i don't think we were very compatible., i pressed my buttons or so i thought, and so on, one day she was really upset about something because a board member called her and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer., um, and he was upset about something and, it was something to do with my department, so she called me to her office and let me know how unhappy she was, um, but it wasn't me being a manager for many years around and i, have very strong opinions about how you treat, challenges with people <peo> with employees, and the way she treated the situation with me was really inappropriate, i thought., she wanted to scare me and make me feel., you know, incompetent or at least that's the way i thought about it., and, i knew it., i tried to be very calm and, said i'd take care of it, and i took care of it., after that our relationship was not the same anymore and i stayed left there in the end <st> uh, to go back to the old organization for which i hadn't worked so long after, because i just didn't really have much respect for her after she did this to me., or after we had this interaction so, < slaughter>, so i heard this advice the other day and or so, thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish i had, read it then, this is, when you think about buying something instead of thinking, uh oh, here's this beautiful coat that costs 100 bucks i'm going to buy., it uh don't think it's as cost a hundred dollars think it's as cost ten times that, because that's effective what your money could do if you don't spend it on this coat, but it invests it, you know, intelligent, you'd have ten times as much money., you really should think about it in these terms and i think i was much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i could uh, ten or twenty years ago, i was more aware of this, <sigh> probably, , they asked me to be his sponsor and his guardian if anything happened to them., and that meant a lot to me because it made me feel that they trusted me and thought i was a good person who could take care of their child if something happened to them., so, <sigh> let's see, good uh in <i> it wasn't really recent but in february i liked to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore, uh and i have to fly first class, we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get those around, tickets and so uh that was really pleasant because, to pull the seats down you get to sleep the food is delicious, you get special attention and i was also not in singapure before, so that was kind of cool too, safe, thank you., see you.",2
478,", yes, thank you., the east coast, for work, very rare, i prefer it out here., it's not as beautiful as the lifestyle out here, i like the weather better and uh just a lot of things about life here, it's my favorite city, so, uh, a little.., but i mostly, what's that?, um, just.., i like to go to france, i like the food there and, it's just the lifestyle, the shopping, that's what it is., uh art history and marketing, um, um.., i was interested in high school, and i thought it was a good.., classic education uh and, um, i interned with andy warhol's magazine when i was in high school and so, the, , hmm, yes, yes, uh, oh, i'm pretty happy with what i do i do to advise so, i write marketing plans this kind of thing, um, it can be pretty hard., on the writing of a marketing plan, um, uh, i don't know that it's hard to talk to someone who's not in marketing, it just requires, in order to gain knowledge of , uh, you know how it is made and it takes several months to do such a thing., um, well, i guess i'm a little shy originally, but, um, i'm getting more and more out, just because of work and stuff., um, i like to train uh i, i walk with my dogs, we go up and down a hill a few times it is, good, uh, i don't remember., um, i don't know i can't think of anything., mm, sometimes i don't clean my car, it could get lots of dog hair in it and i feel bad if i should always stay on it just to wash to the car and so, uh, well, i had a conflict with my brother, and so i had to decide to have an alienation from him and that makes the greatest sense and that was a bit difficult, decision, but just because of his angry behavior, it wasn't that difficult, but.., it was a bit difficult because i loved him very much., um, i'm not near my family., um, but i don't really have one, i've got a, a japanese friend uh oh i think the sensor came from i have a japanese friend i'm uh very close to her is like my kind of my mom, and, , uh, i just met her socially., , i don't know i can't think of anything., <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, <talking to experimenter>, to be fairly simple because i keep a regular schedule, just a little tired maybe a little irritable, uh, good., well, i recover from p t s d, i sometimes feel the p t s d and then i take a medicine for it., no, it's just.., it's only left of which i'm still <sti> i still have the stress of him i'm still being treated for, it i don't really have any, i'd rather not talk about it., to be in the past, but it will be treated, um, five years ago, uh i was i was just very sad very depressed and so uh i was scared too, so i went to, to the doctor and around them helped me, and i have uh psychotherapy, yeah for the p t s d though, um, i don't know, i guess uh, it's just.., just kind of supportive, because because of the problems i have with my family, it's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and, you know, it just gives me good feedback and helps me make good decisions, this kind of thing., i sometimes have nightmares about my family, yes, thank you., oh uh i just try to get better sleep i before i go to sleep i somehow, how to, meditate a little to be calm and then hope that this will help, i feel happy all the time pretty much like i make my dogs make me happy and you know my life is really happy so, mhm, i guess you know as a nice person that i'm thoughtful., to make a good friend around <sigh>, and happy fun person, um, i don't know, i mean, i'm in my forties now, so i'm pretty happy with myself, my <m> you know mine around, you know, uh, i've done a lot of work on myself in therapy and stuff, so i'm pretty, i wouldn't really change much, i'm pretty happy with myself, i don't sound imaginable, but i'm pretty much, now happy with me, that would be about my parents who abuse them very much., i don't talk to them anymore, so <laughter> about everyone you know, if you know them, you know that they.., you know that said <sai> did terrible things to me so, i'd rather not talk about it., let's see., um, well, i just started reading a book i like to read cookbooks and i just read a book called um when french women cook and it's about, uh, a woman relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and that and the kitchen and so i'm really enjoying that book, mhm, um, i usually know you to get the grocery that i enjoy i really like to do the grocery i go to a few places, and clean a little and around, oh just oh relax, oh, yeah, i'd say.., to have better self esteem, because i used to have very low self esteem, which one knows of abuse and so, you know, i wish i was happier in the past and you know it took me a long time to be happy because, to you know no matter what i did no matter what i did no matter what i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know fighting with, being depressed, i didn't even know why, and now you know that i'm aware of it, because of whatever events it was, that it was from my parents this about a relationship and so, i mean, what the council would be, not for a relationship that, is bad for you as sometimes alienation is the best choice in an abusive relationship, um, just the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know about, i think your actions are very important and i try to treat people in a good way., and i guess you know i'm proud that you know about my work, like decisions i made., that gives me.., you know an a job i like gives me a lot, flexibility and i know i'm doing what i like and <sigh> um, and you know people like my work and, um and also my dogs i am really proud of them and, um, yes, i guess <gu> i don't know <laughter>, mhm,

because our windows were open, it was a hot summer day., and then, later, i drove next to her and said in a pleasant way, i said, i'm just trying to signal, to get on your trail, 'cause she was, cursed me through the window that, and she lifted her finger up and she just lifted her finger up and gave me the finger and it was just, it's funny, sometimes you try to get close to someone, in only one normal, love and all they have for you is hate, and that made me feel bad <laughter>, < slaughter>, a little angry, no, because i took the high road <laughter> but they <laughter> regret i'm sure,

somewhere else do not have to drive usually most places have better public transport, i just love <lo> i'm you know i'm a culture junkie i like to experience different kinds of cultures so, this is, , well, you know i wasn't in so many places i liked mexico and italy., it's.., you know, i want to go to more places, i want to go to japan, so this will be interesting, it's usually just with my family., it's my mom, sometimes my girlfriend, sometimes my brother and we.., yes we go to italy we spent two weeks there although that was cool, yeah, that's good., um, living next to the best gelato shop in italy, in we were in florence <f> when we spent in florence uh spent a week in florence, that was great., very very good uh culture there too, article no, studied film and digital media, because uh i make music and i wanted to learn how to make music videos, so it's something i want to interfere with., yes, yes, i mean, i need a camera, but that's the thing., uh but um i mainly my main focus is music i studied film, but my main focus is music, yeah, sure., i've played music, i've played guitar, uh keyboard bass drums, for about twelve years and uh i do uh production and songwriting i'm in an indie rock band, , this is a great site i highly recommend it and it's uh it's my so, check it out, uh international rockstar music producer, and uh, filmmakers, director, likely to start, just the feeling that it's a way to get the best out of life the most, i just talk to people, learn from them and let them learn about you and take care of you it's uh, way goes simply with the area < caritor> territory < laughter>, <laughter> yeah, to do me uh meditation, and, it's not really hard because it's fun., and it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time, the uh you know that this was a great revelation to me that you can relax and concentrate at the same time because usually when i relax i'm tuning out, i'm focusing on something else, but.., to be able to combine these sensations, uh yeah i did this for, uh three months now so, yes, it is., um, almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there are things that should be said, that i don't, just because, you know, it's like opening a can of worms, maybe one of your friends, for example, i have a problem with him, but they don't have a problem with him, necessarily because he didn't do anything to them., and i had to deal with that somehow in the past., uncomfortable social situation, but.., you know i can do it., um, <makes sounds with mouth>, probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh, we were freaking out, we're not gonna be in a band together, i mean, we're still friends, so.., at least there's this mm, but it was basically just about, creative control over the project and how we will prioritize it in our lives and uh, you know we weren't the same priorities, and i was very excited., that was the end, to <sigh>, i felt, good thing it was definitely that you know that a choice had been made on both parties, uh also regretting that you know that he doesn't, feel how i wanted him to feel about what was excited about the project so, the fact that he wasn't really in it somehow pissed me off, um, but.., i got over it., um, and you know, i've got some other people who are really excited to work with me, you know, even honored., so, you know, i'll keep going., thank you., to <sigh>, hmm, i don't know., i don't really have that kind of regret., right now, i can't really think of any, um, < deep breath>, um, when i was in high school, i cheated on my girlfriend, i didn't think it would mean anything at the time., but i did., i regret it, but.., you know, you know that life happens that you make some mistakes, selfishness, to be young and think it doesn't matter, um, you know, thinking, you know that you only live once and, you know for any time it was probably the best thing to end up because you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that with her so, that was years ago, but, she was a nice girl she didn't deserve., i regret it, < deep breath>, um, shit, man., i guess whether to go to college or not, because i had some projects that i didn't really want., shut down, i had a band where we had a manager., we played a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep doing that or go to school and start over., and, i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and start a new life there for four years and, it was a difficult decision, but, i'm glad i did it because i've met a lot of people i'm still very close to today., you know, we work together on things and stuff., it's good., i agree that it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter>, um, maybe i wish i could forget., spanking in the parking lot when i was four of a danish babysitter, uh, you know, on the abuse scale it's pretty low, but it was a bit humiliating and i don't forget it so, i have a pretty vivid picture of it and, i'd be happier if it wasn't there., it's positive., they sometimes support me because they give me a hard time., they, i don't think so., i'm keeping things up about how i'm going to support myself, even though i'm doing it, it's just.., you know i have a, a bigger picture than they do and i have confidence in myself and, the creative projects that i do so, yeah, that's good., there's a little tension., just because, you know they expect certain things from me, and i expect them too, but, i just have a different way of doing it than they might prefer, but they're cute people., how can i deal with them?, they know they're lovely people in their core., um, to deal with her because i love her, i was just.., you know sometimes i just uh, go off alone for a while, and you know whatever you know, you know everyone makes you crazy sometimes so, < deep breath>, challenging, i just try and it doesn't work., sometimes i have to take medication, but i have to take ambien., something like that, um, yes, it's difficult <di>, i'm someone who sleeps late, so i always get at least six or seven hours when i have to wake up early for something, um, i get angry sometimes i'll throw up in the morning, um, yes, i had jobs where i woke up and, you know, vomit while i brush my teeth, it's terrible., it's annoying, it's kind of, something i'm worried that you know i have to work a bit part time while i'm, not, you know, get a steady salary flow for my music production so, yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh>, i've got a few things i need to get over, i'm not really sure how, only, not feeling good to get nervous when, you know, there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or, just something i don't sit, good to me like, in a, they know one who hastened and, you know, stressful working environment it's just about, unless it's about something that matters to me, like music or the arts, it's just very hard,, to be honest,, for example , and you know i'm trying to make myself a psyche to give me shit., it makes me sick, you know, maybe i have a red bull or something and you know my body doesn't want that in the morning it just, i feel like my body rejects things and, yeah, that's good., all right., i felt good., very uh very reflective very contemplative, you know there will be some changes and it will, a few new people in my life a few new people uh in my band, um, you know i'll try to push myself, but try to stay grounded at the same time because you know i expect more from myself, it just bugs me when mine get my you know that i'm basically feeling like i'm, i shit on myself, my body shits on me anyway., i'm so.., son of a bitch, yeah, no, yes, i was diagnosed., of uh, twelve years ago, i was no longer in therapy., um, they gave me zoloft and i didn't like it, i felt worse than in the shitiest moments i told you about it. i felt numb., i don't want to feel deaf, i want to feel everything, even if it sucks., to be forced,, it was a private school., they thought i was going to perform and thought i was an upity kid, i think i was just a kid like that., yes, i know., well, i haven't been to, 12 years, but i think it might be helpful for me in the future, i thought you weren't a therapist, that's a typical therapist question., well, yeah, i.., i want to go back to therapy, it could help., could help me, find some solutions maybe it may not be a therapist i need maybe it's a life coach i have no idea, but, i'll be looking for help soon., um, yesterday, i was watching a movie with my girlfriend., and i looked at her we smiled at each other and it was it was great, yeah, that's good., um, very honest, um, sometimes brutally like that, but i'm a good guy, i think my friends think i'm a good guy, probably funny, um, opened, um, i think it's what i'm working on, trying to improve my discipline, and try to work through, my body refuses shit, of the world, < slaughter>, it gets better <sigh>, um, staying in shape will be more difficult, the longer you wait, um, don't give up doing your dreams what you do, my music, you are welcome to talk nice to you",7
482,", yes, i'm fine., i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah, i was, i've never been there., um, i don't have any relatives there., i have no reason to go back there., um, <makes sounds with mouth>, well, my family's here., this is one, uh, the weather is great, uh the beaches and mountains are here, all these things are very good, uh, transport, that's probably <probab> probably say most people, um, it's expensive to live here., that's probably the first two, recently i've traveled, um, you get to see new places and new people, learn more about other cultures, and uh different ways people think, oh uh at the end of the march i went to ecuador for a week, uh, i spent most of the time one day with, with an ecuadorian who speaks only spanish and i speak very little spanish, so we have, it was a challenge for me to communicate with him, i felt like a little child., try to , you know you know what that is, what it is., it was very humiliating., um, you know, just see that, you know if you don't, if you're not able to communicate then that this can be very difficult, i'm probably more of a shy person., genetics i don't know why, i'm an electrician, so i studied electrical engineering., i also studied uh computer networking, um, it was, i guess.., just uh kind of circumstances, i needed, the, the work i did was not to care for the family, and, i knew someone who could get me a job at the electrical work and so i tracked it because of the financial gain, mm, it gave me a lot of opportunity., but i don't think that's what i want to do for the rest of my life., i'm going to be a missionary., uh my wife and i are looking at the move to ecuador in autumn, uh for four years, and last year we trained in north carolina, for one year, and that was like theology and bible training, um, essentially putting god, a um, a desire in my heart to go beyond, to get beyond myself and do something for other people, to go and, and learn about other people their culture, and to share the gospel with them, good in my immediate family, um, i'm married, i've been married for ten years, this june, and we have four daughters., and then, but i have an older brother, no sisters, um, what do you want to know about my family?, um, i'm really close to my wife and daughters, i'm not very close to my brother because he's mentally handicapped., he has the mental capacity of a seven year old., although he's five years older than me, so just because of this dynamic, it's hard to have a close relationship with him., but i'm pretty close to my parents my brother lives with my parents, um, i'd say my, my youth pastor in high school, he was a really positive influence in me, um, only he has a, he has a drive and a zeal for, for the persecution of the truth, um, and just.., study of the bible, and, and because of its influence this kind of, to want to study the bible, i think i've gotten better at it., there were, times in which, you know i'm getting angry., and uh, you know it can only, somehow really reign over me only the frustration, and i'm the kind of person that needs me, usually it takes some time until i get angry and some time to, to calm down again, but i did, i've learned.., over time, the really angry, and keeping that anger within yourself doesn't do it., it doesn't., attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at, just somehow attacks me, and so it's really not a it's not a good behavior to, to keep it that way, if things piss me off, i'll try, uh, how to talk to the other person tell you know that this situation makes me angry i try to talk through them somehow, and to resolve it and come to a resolution, to compromise even more than just, but try to really solve the root of the problem, to <sigh>, well, a, a few weeks ago or maybe it was even a month ago, um, my wife and i were on a trip with her parents, and her parents had already left, we just drove down., orange land area for this trip, and, my wife wanted her to expect certain things to be done before the trip, or that certain things be packaged., and, but had not really, in my eyes, she hadn't made that clear, but in her eyes she had, and so, when i tried to meet these expectations, they, um, you know i didn't get her after what she wanted and she got angry and so from my perspective i did what she wanted, and somehow being attacked for it., so, then i started yelling at her., and, and we know that we had this conflict, but then.., you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had somehow talked by, and we had found out what was the cause of this conflict, um, ask the moment during the conflict, uh, very you know only mm very angry you know that you can feel it, in the body, um, part i, which i guess, the, anger was probably the secondary answer, but my initial answer was that i felt that the feeling was attacked and that came out as anger, so, i'd think.., yeah so at first i felt attacked and then that led to anger, mm hmm, i guess it was.., decide to go, to go to our training last year, i felt that god had put my heart on me., that this was something i was supposed to pursue, my wife didn't feel that way, and, i, i just felt very strong that this was something we should pursue, and, but at the same time i knew that if my wife did not support it it would somehow fall apart, so, i kind of gave it up <r> gave it up, um, and i and i said to her, you know i'm not gonna force you.., you know, if you want to go, then we're going, but if not, then we're going to do something else, we're going to look at something else and we're not going., that was difficult for me because.., do you remember that kind of felt like a loss because i felt deeply that i should do what i should do?, um, but then, after i kind of gave it up, then, um, then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about doing this, and then we went ahead and persecuted it so, so it was kind of difficult for me to give it up, was <wa>, tell me about something bad or something i can erase from my memory, um, oh let me see, i'm not sure., i don't know, i can't really, think of something very traumatic, i'd want to delete it, but i think, they know good things and positive things and bad things they all somehowa, shape who we are, and, so i can't think of anything i want to delete, usually, it's not usually that bad., um, are you referring to the questionnaire where i said that i had problems < trou> some sleep disorders, um, the work that i work the way the planning has shifted, so that i, so lately i've been working some night shifts, or cemetery layers, so, um, come home in the morning, you know, when it's bright, it was hard for me to sleep., but it was mostly because i stayed up so late because of work., uh, it's pretty simple., um, if i don't sleep, then i'm gonna get crooked, uh, i've been feeling good lately, no, not really., no, no, um, hmm, i don't know., i can't think of anything that, the way of the ordinary, but, um, yesterday, we took my wife and i, took our three < th> our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest, to stay with her grandmother, but we took her to the park and they played., and, yes, so those are always happy times when we bring the children to the park, um, i think he'd say i'm a, a family father, that.., i'm sure he can count on me., usually my friend i'm doing at the end, um, various work around the house for him, because i'm a craftsman., so this way i think he'd say i'm kind of reliable or someone he could go to to advice, um, i guess i'd.., i guess i'd like to be able to, um, start conversations with people, simpler, sometimes, i'm in trouble., i'm just talking to people., especially if they're in a group, if people are one on one, then it's usually easier for me to talk to them., but somehow talking to people in a group, i wish i was a little better at it, now, if there is, all right., what i wanted to say before that was,, when i give a speech to a large group, i don't really have a problem with it, but if it's more interaction, it's kind of difficult., uh, advice i would have given myself ten or twenty years ago, um, probably it would have been to go to college immediately instead of going to school later in life., um, that's it., i thought that made the biggest difference., in my life i think, um, well, i have four children and, i hope i raise them right i hope that, that.., you know the mistakes i made, i can somehow lead them, through their journey in life and i hope that they, at the end a little, better for them than, when i, um, yeah, i just hope, hope somehow through them, that i can, you know, leave <lea> something rewarding, you're welcome.,

was pretty funny., kind of scary and dangerous, almost killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>, travel or just in general, hmm, um, i have to say , i have to say, we were, we were on our way out to, we had, from the p c h and goes into, leguna, and laguna has this really steep hill and on sunday it is full of traffic, and i remember going down, the hill and my brakes didn't work and i tried to hit my brakes and try to hit my brakes and they just wouldn't click, and i was like oh god, and i'm on a tricycle bike, so i'm taller than most bikes and i'm like circling between like grid lock traffic, going down a hill, non brakeable, and i'm going down, and suddenly, there is this car that is directly in mm veers essentially where i try to go, so i, rotate, strong, before this bus and this truck and literally at the end go sideways through the traffic through incoming traffic, and then loop <laughter> back into the right traffic through incoming traffic, still without brakes, and how not to keep my bike from, rolling that's painful when your bike rolling somehow hurts a lot, so yes., yeah, that's it., < slaughter>, um, various things uh anthropology visual effects, kind of weird, but yes., um, i always had a fascination for film, and, i think the way people do things and do things is fascinating., just like the mob mentality of the people, special, oh, dream job, um, what are you doing?, i have no idea., just one job, i guess, i see myself as an outbound, um, you know, i've never been afraid of what people think of me., like people i i like people i don't know, i'm not, i'm not afraid of what they think, i'm more worried like the people i know and what they think of me., i guess being out like that is just not really, influence me, eh, um, , um, yes reading books i like reading and drawing books, read the books drawing play video games, have i thought of something have i forgotten all sleep, i like to sleep, it's fun., uh <mumble> not good, <laughter> common <laughter>, um, <sigh>, uh, in high school, i pushed someone's head through a locker., um, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's not good, never push anyone's head into a locker., this is a good way to be suspended, um, i don't know., yes things like this only, always in fights, <sigh>, um, like a serious argument, to <sigh>, uh, i guess how, , argument about, about, um, uh i think about how uh like views on how weapons control, and arms control laws, i mean,, it was like, last night, oh, that's it., it was an argument that you know gun control scheme i mean it doesn't really affect me personally, but that was like the last argument i came into, that's kind of what you said, i think., ooh, um, all my life.., <laughs> uh <mumbling> <sigh>, i've been, um, on, two years ago i broke up, with how everyone calls her my evil ex, and, yeah, it was just so bad that the whole thing went wrong, i mean,, uh, eh, i think i've calmed down a lot since then., like a person as a whole, but i mean, i was angry and so i think that i like on my bike for like, hundreds of miles more in a unique day, and i was in a ton of pain, for example , later in the evening i came home i was like oh god, it's like i can barely walk., and yes, i think i'm running away and, as on a like extreme cycling spree was not good, but it was better than how, too much food and like, only, overeating because i was depressed, but yes how we fought and shouted and it was not good as if i did not fight physically, it was more like a screaming match of death, , um, i don't think i had a unique hard decision., i've ever had to do, because, my biggest thing, in life, you don't know you don't regret it., i don't regret it., the things you do, i just regret the opportunities you missed, and that's like you had to come with me., that was how i had to learn that in the past like two years, like two years ago, i just couldn't understand this concept, and to answer your question, i'm thinking about thinking, the hardest decision i had to make, is, i'd say , likely, likely to break with my ex probably, um, <sigh> ooh, around <sigh> where do i start, <sigh>, um, my ex was not a good person just in any form or form of the word, she did a few things i didn't feel quite comfortable with., only to the people around them and to me, and, i, < deep breath>, <laughter> you know, they say you should forgive people., to do for mistakes or things, and i just think there are some things that people can't forgive., no matter how hard you try, and i think there are some things that are done once, that it can't be, andone they're just they're the way they're, and i think, i'm thinking about what she did., i just like , eh, things just fall apart after it's just us, mm despite us try, it just didn't work., i mean,, i don't know that i don't really want to talk about exactly what happened., oh, god, what are you doing?, oh, man., to delete from my memory or just to delete from ever happen, um, i don't know, you know that's hard., um, katrina, only the experience of katrina for the beginning, my ex , i guess it's kind of tough between the two of them, i'd rather lean towards katrina., 'cause that was just that it wasn't, i mean, i guess you don't know exactly, but.., in two thousand five around, uh this huge storm hit, uh, new orleans louisiana to kill a whole bunch of people, levelled the city, um, and, i lost a lot of friends during the storm, um, i mean, i kind of get over it, but, it's still, it's still there., and i think, i don't know, i mean, you can try and look you can try your best and find something positive, but nothing is the only thing., what you can do, is <i>, just think it was like a freak accident and it's never gonna happen again, but <laughter> i live in l a and you know, <laughter> earthquake, <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think, oh i'd rather, do you rather know it's coming than not knowing it's coming?, yes, <laughter> yeah, <sigh> um, mm depression repeats several times, it's not a surprise., the first time i was diagnosed was in middle school., that would be.., <sigh> ten a good twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years, i don't know , i don't know when i was in sixth grade, that's, it's when the first time i was told i was depressed, um, as far as p t s d goes, to go to katrina, um, and then, you know, i'm just.., post katrina mostly < laughter> that was the big deal, um, i guess that had been previously diagnosed as being depressed and still in high school, it was kind of not that i wasn't really looking for help, it's kind of that i was kind of coming to my high school., and they were like here's help because we know you're gonna need it, um, and i was like oh good, thanks for not really asking for it, but okay, i'll take it., um, you know, it just happened somehow., no not not anymore, um, eh, <sigh>, <laughter> that's a good question about <laughter>, you know i really don't know., i guess it kind of stopped, just kind of was how good i'm not gonna do that anymore, sometimes, sometimes it's the way you feel today., and so and so, you know, it's kind of good, i feel good right now, but, ask me in two hours and who knows, you know, um, <sigh>, i guess.., it has helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen, and just keep walking and moving with your life, um, mm essentially only, mm how to continue you know, things will go on, <sigh>, um, wow <laughter> around, um, i was.., i was hanging out with my girlfriend., hanging out, um, good for the beginning i mean, you can't, i just went for a walk with a stick because i was recently hit by a car., and i'd make my leg better, um, let's see, the stick's over there., in this way but still around <sigh>, i don't know., uh make me less fat, < slaughter>, um, i would make it so that i would not feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day., because if you sleep more than ten hours a day, it's just unproductive that you're wasting too much time., how i have friends who like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like you do, i need to sleep like 12 hours to feel good., how you can sleep six, you know, as in in crunch time you know that you're with four i have to go with, seven, or eight, you know, for example , this is my crunch time sleep plan eight hours, it's just, i don't know, i'm sleeping, but i like sleeping, too., i mean,, yeah, it's just the sleepy part i don't like., um, <sigh>, um, completely crazy in a good way, completely crazy in a good way, um, uh, i guess,, how they would also, say how you know, there are times when i could seem like an asshole and i'm not really an asshole i'm just, you know, i'm just having problems like everyone else., in particular, i have, asperger is a kind of autism., that makes life simply fantastic, you'd also say i'm extravagant and eccentric, 'cause it's totally me, i just.., i don't know., i think i'm still alive, so i should live because i'm still alive, and you know, who knows how long i'll be alive, so i should know, live while i live and only, go out and do things and not, do not sit and be calm, except when i read, and i like to read, <sigh>, um, stop fucking with me, no, it's kind of messed up., um, i think, i would have told myself then., um, because i knew., my evil ex, i've known her since i was six and she was five., i think ten years ago, i would have grabbed my shoulders and said that you see this girl, whatever you do if you're not with the girl., don't trust her that she can't be trusted., and more importantly , don't, don't leave your guard around her, because she'll exploit it., and i mean how physically don't leave your guard mentally, um, yeah don't date here just don't do it's not worth it < laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain, it's not worth it., the fact that i'm still alive, maybe, yeah, that's good., uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of this pretty proud that i managed to do it, um, only, i don't know, i don't really know that i don't really use the term pride., i don't feel really proud., i'm just it's more like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>, i don't know if that makes me humble or just crazy, who knows?, i now press the button, goodbye., all right.",15
484,", < slaughter>, yes, i'm fine., i was born in eichenland, around <sigh> all different areas of the city, uh the different cultures that are here, the transport of, lack of public transport, and the superficiality, < slaughter>, i wouldn't like to travel anymore, to <sigh>, to be able to experience a different way of life, you come outside the bladder you normally live in, and, to get a different perspective, in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months, and i was in bahia, which is in the north and around, let's see, the program was to learn the story, learn the language and stay with a host family., i've always wanted to travel, and i chose brazil because.., they have an afro brazilian population or a large afro brazilian population that i really wanted to learn more about and i think the story and the kullture is really interesting, um, i think i'll be alone with a bus., a remote beach and only navigate on your own and find out where to go, yeah, that's good., at the moment i get my master in social work, < slaughter>, dream job <sigh> i think to advise on mental health and, how to, how to intervene effectively with different cultures, and research and advise and travel, um, essentially that this would be the main features, i think it's a fake dichotomy., but i think i'm shy, but at the same time walking in the sense that i'm pushing myself to do things outside my comfort zone, and i'm determined to do what it takes to succeed, < slaughter>, i listen to music, and just lay on my bed and, um, i guess you could say to be mindful and really distract me from things., also breathing exercises, about which i learn more, as well as movement, pretty good, i don't get angry often, um, as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that, hmm, um, mm which month this month may be, probably two months ago, and i argued, via sms <laughter> so it's not really intense to argue, but, i guess you could argue in a sense whether i should be forgiven for something i thought was inferior, um, with a friend i've had for a few years, i felt scared, um, sad and angry, um, yes, these are the most important emotions, i know her because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and able to identify her, and then i will notice the physical, uh manifestations of emotions like when my heart is racing or when i am sweaty, if my breathing is shallower, i know i'm afraid something's bothering me., hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter> hm <laughter>, that i wish i'd handled differently, i guess, in the context of this argument,, i went out one night and got, a little too intoxicated and < clears throat> ended, to call one person for a ride, at home, but that, really upset this person, and i know that, it wasn't such a big deal, but i wish i hadn't let myself get to that point., it influenced a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did, mm, empty the throat , difficultest decision <sigh>, wow around, probably decide what type of graduate program to go into i short law school and decided not to do so after, well after taking off i really had to, think about what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to do, dedicate my life to go into debt for a lot of energy for, to <sigh>, i think by recognizing what i don't want to do, and a lot of research on, program requirements and the jobs you can get after completing a program, <sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh>, oh, laughter , um, revolve around the same person i was talking about earlier., it was a dating relationship and, a few years ago we had a fall, about his treatment from me, and it involved, another person and i wish i could, i'll get that out of my head., to <laughter>, < slaughter>, i have a pretty good relationship with my mother, she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her, but i did, to get closer to her as an adult, we talk quite regularly, with my father i grew up with him, he usually lives in atlanta and, we don't talk so much, but.., we are, we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really,, it's quarrelsome or something., and i'm a single child, so i don't have any siblings i don't have a big family, that's why i'm here., in general, i'm not really that close to the family, um, one person is my mentor whom i met in two thousand five, and she's a judge and i met her when i was on the community college and she really, opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things, <sigh> pretty easy good it's easy for me to sleep, which is not easy to get up, because i don't usually look forward to what i have to do on that day, and the thought of it is, you know, i just want to stay in bed, i also wake up pretty tired, not really feeling refreshed, empty the throat , i just think <sigh>, self talk about how what i have to do, is not so bad or that the things i do now will end pretty soon with the end of the school year, um, try to think of things that, i can look forward to the week to listen to music too, and surfing the internet somehow gets my mind going, <sigh> feeling <sigh>, um, wow, um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um.. um..

a mixture of ambivalence and feeling drains and a mixture of, feeling reached and proud at the same time, no, i didn't., yes, in two thousand six, the convergence of many stressful factors, i was out of contact with my mother, i started to be good, i had moved to a university that was pretty strict., and all these changes go on, really.., aggravated, things that were already there were depressive tendencies that were already there, and it came to a point where i felt really overwhelmed, yes, i do., yes, i notice, i'm better able to, accept my feelings and do not judge them and also identify them, i am sighing , able to think <th>, think differently about the things that happened maybe you see things in a more positive light, and also identify, the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in these areas, empty the throat , mm < sigh>, last weekend, i again connected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be in contact again, <laugher> <sigh>

intellectual, um, i wish i hadn't., or wait, i wish,, i was better able to cope with my fear and depression that i'm working on., and i wish i had more energy, < slaughter>, start therapy <laughter> now, but yes i would really and, also, to, what how old am i twenty eight, ten years ago eighteen okay so graduated from high school, i would say to myself that i should collect more work skills so that i don't have to fight so much in the future., and look for mentors to get a clearer idea of what i wanted to do as a career, um, i think i'm in school., and, from the background that i, that i come from, low socio economic status and, i'm just pressing through., challenges to come here, < slaughter>, you're welcome., see you.",9
485,", yes, i'm not bad, i'm a little tired, but okay, uh by saint louis missouri, yep, two months ago, i don't often think i'm out here now., uh smaller city fewer people everyone somehow seems different the pace of life is slower out there, uh looking for work as a game designer or game developer only, try something new to new place new people, i think i'll get used to it., um, i guess.., people are different, you know there are small shops everywhere., everything is different, man, the weather's great out here., people are really nice, how to look at the mountains the beach is beautiful, only, better geography, around traffic i guess the commute, and sometimes there may be too many people, < slaughter>, not really never outside the u s before, i never had the opportunity, but i'd like to leave., uh game design and graphic design type of, oh, i love it, uh, mm play video games since i was a kid like most guys my age so, easy how to make people happy and it's somehow easy to do that with games, < slaughter>, uh working for myself make my own games and write my own paychecks i think, i've been trying to do it in the last few years, it's a little difficult, i think i'm kind of shy, it depends on the people and the environment i think,, < slaughter>, uh playing guitar listening to some music talking to friends, i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temperament i'm not the kind of guy that gets really easily angry, probably with my girlfriend about something stupid i can't remember., uh.., i don't know, i don't think i'm really guilty about everything i'm trying to avoid being guilty, hmm, don't know, i can't think of anything., leaving saint louis was one of them because all my friends and family were there., uh i guess the benefits outweigh, you know the disadvantages, definitely, huh <sigh> maybe thrown out of high school for the first time, i got myself and my friends in trouble., it was just not good for you to look back at it somehow and, i guess that's something from my past, i wish i'd done it differently., uh, according to the <laughter> rules, i think only a good student would have helped, uh, not really so close to my family i have a small family anyway and, when i was in saint louis, we saw each other a few times a year, but that's really it, so no strong ties, i guess most of my friends are always there to support and encourage me and help me., say pretty easy every now and then there's a night i can't sleep, but it's quite rare, mm only tired groggy, i guess my mind is unfocused and, day goes by a hell of a lot longer, um, pretty good., not really much to say, maybe a little more depressed because i'm away from most of my friends and family, but, nothing insurmountable, just try to talk to them when i can think of something else that thinks of happy times., no, no, uh <sigh> i guess on the ride out here, because it was such a new experience and so intoxicating, i think i was really proud of myself and looking forward to the future., just i guess some kind of euphoria standing there, it seemed kind of surreal <su> surreal, uh, funny caring nice guy, easy to understand with, uh.., pretty happy to be me, i guess, hmm, guess when i broke up with my last girlfriend, for obvious reasons you're trying to fight and say things you wanted, you'd forget., no, i don't like living in the past, so there's nothing really to regret, uh.., work hard and only, think about what you do before you do it, play video games with friends on the computer, uh, music uh, and my friends i appreciate <laughter>, mm, i appreciate my determination and my my passion, for my creativity, see you.",2
486,", yes, i feel great, i am by saint louis missouri, born and raised, yes, i've been here a few times. i just retired two months ago., saint louis is quite slower, to take care of a good friend who is sick, thank you., i jumped right back on the train, climate, and the restaurants, the dirt, and transport, yes, i do., uh the roadmaps after a roadmap, maybe drive yourself, we have recently returned from uh colorado, went up into the mountains, and saw the snow, and, enjoyed a little fine food, in colorado, uh, actually, it's.., horseback riding through the royal gorge, yeah, that's it., i would be more outgoing, i'm a human person, < slaughter>, i listen to jazz music and also draw, i probably controlled my temper., up to age, it would have been my husband and it was about financial, questions, insecure <un> insecure, unstable i don't like to talk loud or mm loud emotion, i like to sit and talk methodically and logically about things, do not raise my voice, hmm, finally, with my friend's illness, i wish i had treated his sister a little differently than, things she wanted me to do, that i really had to tell her, other, the way they really had to be done, i accepted their advice where i did not, we, he, i was engaged to him., fifteen years ago and he recently called me, i guess about five years ago and told me that he was diagnosed with cancer, we have always maintained our friendship, and i asked my husband if i could help him in his time of need and, i'm here., it has , he's a good friend of mine and his sister moved here too., two my son wanted to start his career here, three i love the weather, and that's all i can think about right now <laughter>, mhm, it would be the death of my youngest son., i don't know where to start until he was born early., and since he was born so early, i had him in five months about nine, which we, we've made the decision to take him off life support because he didn't get any better., so that would have been the hardest decision i've made, with my husband, mhm, um, i don't want to erase anything from my memory., i really.., learn and experience and learn knowledge of things that happen, so i'm not <ss>, i'm not the one who wipes things out of my head., i categorize them, and bring them back to life, it's very close., my mother lost at a young age, and uh all siblings and my father still stay very close, my father, oh he is very healthy conscious very energetic and exercises <e> uh exercises, and, has a spirituality about him, that.., i want to, also it is a satisfaction to have, that he, that he portrays, that i, that i also like to have, no problem, very confused or to skittish i guess the word would be, lately, well, except for the fact that my good friend, whom i'm helping,, we just got out of the hospital, so it's been a little hectic in the last two days., yes, not lately, no i didn't, no i didn't, i was excited., with good friends in good company i should say and order, i had just come back from a concert, so it was outside, it was pleasant music i was with good friends, we ate well and enjoyed the moment, and as a, give, spiritual, normal person i don't know <laughter>, um, i can't think of anything i want to change except, maybe a little more training, i, i can't remember one out of my hand., no, to, have, save more money, and, do not try to achieve everything at once, i started in cosmetology, then i went to college., have some college in mathematics, and finance, travel, i had a lot of <lo> i like it to enjoy good food, nice wine and company i went to a, very nice italian restaurant and was in the company of good friends and family and, we ate and spoke and, that was fun., proud of, i guess it's my kids., you're welcome., see you.",4
487,", yes, i'm fine, thank you., detroit michigan, yes, i moved to ia in two thousand and seven, but my family came here., many years ago more than forty years ago, i'm not going back to detroit., i really don't like the weather and i have no reason for most of my immediate family is out here, in california and, uh totally different around, for me was detroit just very cold it wasn't, the best for my personality i prefer l a more space, a warmer climate warmer people, only one other, different uh vibe, that i like better, after my husband and i ended relationship, i had family out here, so i thought it would be easier, to start here from the beginning, as some of the other places i had lived, or stay where we were at, extremely easy i came to visit here every year while i was in college so i was extremely used to it, plus i had also, taken out of school by six months and lived out here, and went to school out here, so i was totally used to it, well, like i said, the weather is number one it's just uh, less crowded it is more free space it is a, a quieter friendly atmosphere, less hurry, the smog would be one., and when i drive the traffic, in certain areas it may be, but, um, in general, there's not much i don't like < l> it's, as i think, the general threat to the earthquake, but that's, is not really such a factor because it rarely happens, the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one i don't necessarily like, i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all, so, i don't travel as much as i used to., but i've travelled all over the world, new experiences, well, i used to be an international flight attendant and then i traveled later, through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so, i have visited many different places and, i have to say it was them., all quite a lot of fun because you know there are different cultures to learn to see different things, enjoying experience, my experiences i would say in order, i visited europe more than that i also visited, uh in south south america i guess because the cultures are so very different, i would probably say rather shy around in general, in comparison to people i know are really very outgoing, but also, i let them describe me as starting, i like to read i like to walk or go electricity or walk, listening to music you know, i'm very good at controlling my temperament, oh, probably when i was, married to my husband many years ago, there could be many things i don't even know in specific, but just everything in general quite a lot could get into a debate slash argument with him, it could be a choice., uh, some of the cases if i could have been with him and i, you know it got emotional, or, let me bother him that he's such a big deal of something, instead of, um, you know you saw it., not reacting something, maybe, but it would always be, we were also urged to respond like this, you know you can't always say that you can ignore a person there, because it's often just about ignoring the situation and it doesn't escalate., but some people, you know you're not responding to the so called norm., if you ignore it, they'll only know they're escalating, but that's not always the case., i taught middle school children and you can try to rest, to use methods with them, but that doesn't always work, but you always have to take care of how the teacher, you know your professional behavior so that you don't really, even if they know that the children do something outrageous or potentially dangerous for themselves or other children., well, that could be, several, mm, i guess it's a decision in.., together with my mother decide to let a relative have surgery, uh, that you know that the result was uncertain, it could go either way, and in this case she died so, you know, it's a pretty tough decision because you don't know, but you also know if it couldn't be very serious., results also for them, mhm, oh many different things that could happen, you know in life that you are always second guess, things you might be able to do, but, they can also be learning experiences, so it is necessarily a good thing,, delete them you know if, they can see it as positive, sometimes people can have a, strong reaction and they don't really stop by, uh impact of the event, because there could be something that, you can choose from that, but there i grew up in a house of, dysfunction so there was, just domestic abuse you know and.., there have been many cases, so you can't just say one thing because there are many traumatic things., but it would also have been a different outcome if one had learned to deal with some things., who appear as adults in life,, sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends who, had not really strong experiences, fall apart or just have very difficult times to deal with,, you can listen that you know that you and i, because i understand that not everyone has the same experience you know., go through them, levels of, understanding and you know,, how you know someone, they have a balance of background information on, which will help them undress and see that you know that things will, progress in a better way know that this is not like, the end of the world or as terrible as it seems it could be, and you can also tell other experiences with them, of things that were worse, or, you know, seem to be, and of course there is always in general i mean, when you look at all the misfortunes of the world, you know that most of these things don't affect, we or the people we know here, , so that, perspective, which, you know that you're someone from her, i won't necessarily say self absorption, but the apparently, intensity of her experience at the moment, now we have a good relationship with her, anyway in most cases there are different levels of, to stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced, so it has, made them interact with life and people you know more than others, some have not been having, so much, experience in life that helps them to deal with things you know in a different way, so it keeps evolving, and i, go into positivity as a trace of, you know how i react to trying to testify., a more positive, answer from them, instead of feed, sometimes the, very strong reactions or reactions or interactions that they may have, excuse me., i didn't hear you repeat it., my mother different teachers friends, well, my mother has always been a very calm, around person for the most part reckless, although she has experienced a lot, negativity i had teachers who were around, very., positive <po> positive and proactive, and have learned to think independently and, techniques to learn about some of the things that, it occurred, and only different friends you know that i would see the company, situations sometimes much more difficult you know how to deal with things so, most of the time, it's important that you know it pretty well., it depends on whether i'm dealing with a lot of things or study, or, you know., i'm trying to get more hours a day because i have to do things, then you know it's less, but, um, in general i have no problem sleeping, it's only if i let myself stay awake because there are more things i want to do, i have the feeling that okay uh less you know stressful in it generally goes because i have several projects that i work on so, but generally good, for example , i mean,, not particularly, i mean, i just seem, um, less stressful as i get more things done i just get and the stress comes from sometimes there are a lot more things to do, in a shorter period, but, you know how to reorganize, some of the, things that need to be done, you know you can smooth this out., no, i didn't, but i know it's something that, a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people, i have not been going on, well, there are several i think about, and happiness comes in, small or big things, but generally every day <d> every day every moment for me i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning, is big, wonderful, you know the day of happiness around, as far as large, festive types of things i don't have great ups and downs like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum, you know, every day it can be a really great food it could be a great view it could be, you know a moment you shared with someone you know., it should be a straight on a straight keel, um, as uh uh, persistent, you know i will., continue and, and, positive, excited, um, maybe not to do, things different when i was younger than spending my money differently or, or mine, time you know a little more differently, but, that's hard to say, it's like okay, how your getting older you can see, you know you could have done some things differently., instead of buying, the house i did, i would have told you that you waited and bought another, i mean things like that., i would have.., made me california earlier and i'm, i would have.., instead of buying the house that i would have bought if i knew that i was, if you knew what kind of situation i'm in right now, wait to get something else, but you know how to, you know that in retrospect you make the best decision you can at the time, available with the best information <in> information, you know after you've looked at several options, from to, be present, independent and formed able,, take care of me., all right., goodbye.",0
488,", yes, beautiful, oh san fernando tal, i like the culture i love to go to museums and go at night and have lots of people., it's a lot spread out and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive anywhere and not over a good public transport system, uh not really i like to go camping, but i don't really travel, i think i was on a geology class six months ago., yeah, it was fun., hmm <sigh>, i think it's hard to say, well, i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to the death valley, and i have a lot of really cool things to see and hang out with my friends at night, philosophy, yes, um, hmm, i don't know, i think it just happened that i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of got disappointed and i liked, all the different, ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy, what are you doing?, i don't know, but i really like kids and i like, to study your behavior, so i think something along these lines could be, i think i'm usually pretty outgoing i tend to be shy about my family, but if i'm close to friends and stuff i, i think i'm pretty friendly, many times i will watch or read t v, um, yeah, that's good., i think i'm pretty good i'm not getting really angry i'm trying to think about it, other things when i start to get crazy or.., i'm just trying to focus on my breathing, i think the last time i had a fight with someone, it was probably with my boyfriend., but i'm having trouble remembering what was the last thing we were arguing about., i think it was <wa> i didn't feel very good and i had difficulty deciding if i wanted to go to his department at the end of the year party, and he got frustrated, which i thought was very reckless, because i didn't feel well to start with, i had the feeling that he didn't really consider my feelings and, i, really hate when he gets stressed or gets slightly angry because i see that as unnecessary and it emphasizes me out, hmm, i think many times when my, oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother, uh does something wrong i tend too hard with him uh we're not so close, as my sister and me or my youngest brother and me, and so he tends to be hostile back, and i think if i was a little gentler, it might be easier to communicate with him., hmm, um, when i was nineteen, i came home., by a party, i think at four o'clock in the morning on a sunday morning and my father got really angry at me and yelled at me saying a lot of not very nice things, and then he didn't talk to me for a year, well, my relationship with my mother is much better now that i don't live at home., i was very frustrated with her all the time because she has a very fast temperament, but i think now that i have a little more distance, i can see that she did the best she could, to <sigh>, and i love my siblings i, again my little sister and i really get along well she's, four years younger than me, and when, when she was at twelve and i was at sixteen, it was really difficult because she had a really hard temper and she was always moody and, it wasn't me., in a place to be patient with this kind of stuff, so we fought all the time, but we no longer, and that's really great, and, we get along well with my uh, my older little brother, who is fifteen and i think i'm getting pretty good with my youngest brother, who is twelve, , one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved their classes and it was really good, uh in a class with a professor who really cared and, who really hired people who were really motivating, as not all my classes were so, i think it's pretty easy, i mean sometimes i have trouble sleeping, but, usually it's not that bad, i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning., um, well, i'm really tired i can get grumpy, but i think i'm usually just, groggy, pretty good, i'm a little worried about, um, about getting a job and i'm going to summer school over, it's just a class, so i have a lot of free time., um, yeah, that's good., yeah, that's good., i mean, it's not the end of the world when i don't get a job, but i know that after all, i usually think i just don't try to think too much about it and i don't try to be pessimistic, no, no, hmm, well, i think the last time i felt really happy i, went to a party with my friend at the end of the department party, and, i was the one you know i knew some people there, so i felt comfortable, but i was also able to meet new people, and there were a few kids there squirting around in the pool and i had some drinks and ate something to eat and it was fun, she would probably say that, i'm smart and uh, quite intellectually i love to read and see, really like serious movies and t v, um, and she would probably also say that i'm fun because we like to go out and have a lot of fun, well, i'm kind of, um, i can really be disorganized, and that sometimes gets me into trouble like that., so that's a great one, the and procrastination, hmm, i had a bit of trouble a few months ago and had to go to court and was uh, if you use , eh, sixty hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing so, so i had to show in court again to get an extension and the judge was, very mean and he didn't seem i mean he screamed me, but it didn't seem, as he thought it seemed like it was just some kind of supply, talk he gave to everyone he thought needed, so i understand that, because that's his job., but it was, has not been taking place, great for me because i wasn't i was really scared in this situation, well, i would have been twelve., and two, um, but i think, i think i would have told myself when i was 12, not being so hard on myself and not being so hard on my parents because i think, i was a little selfish and self involved back then, i can't think of anything, i regret how i treated my mother when i was a child, but everyone does that and, um, i regret it., a few of, before semesters i didn't get so good at school and i got a, a few ws i have to work now to get on my transcript, i think i'm, i think i'm.., i didn't concentrate at school at the time., and i haven't seen any counselors at school or anything so i could definitely have done that, i think i'd spend my ideal weekend on saturday and then, walking or maybe just going to the duck pond at my house, feeding ducks and picking oranges, and then maybe, go shopping for breakfast sunday and just like windows, and maybe a little t v, what are you doing?, my youngest brother is autistic and my mother and father always worked when he grew up., i'm ten years older than him., and as the oldest i always took care of him,, made me really patient because he was a handful, but i'm really proud of how he
