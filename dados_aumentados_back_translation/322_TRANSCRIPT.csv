"I started doing yoga, and you know that I've been doing it for about a year, and"
that's uh and meditation and that helped a lot
"Uh, it's just that you know when I was diagnosed with depression, I thought I shouldn't take any medication for it."

They know I was influenced by them.

I mean like i
"some of the things the political leaders do, uh, really drives me crazy"

"Yeah, that's good."
I mean the first four years of uh
"Obama administration, I'd think it was wasted because"
if the
if Congress
had acted jointly
"Uh anyway, things have been done, then you know that we're going to be"
Maybe we could have made it much harder for China to catch up.
and you know that China is able to do things and do things much faster.

"You know, find <fi> uh find faults with each other and don't do things"
