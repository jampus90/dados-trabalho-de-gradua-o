value
Yes
I'm pretty good.
Uh as far as my parents ethiopia
Yes
around the beaches the warm weather
Around the diverse environment
Uh traffic <Laughter>
I'm in school now and I'm studying African.
"I've always been interested in African studies, actually I've always wanted to help people and I thought I could help them."
try to learn about it and get back to Africa and make an impact
"somehow in between I have my shy moments but then when I'm around a group of people I enjoy, I'm pretty outgoing"
"To relax, I usually write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play my guitar"
pretty good I don't really
Get angry or something.
I tend to keep it in
or try to publish it by writing
um
I can't remember the last time I had a fight with someone.
mm all the people I've hurt in the past
I've been
like defrauded people
hurting her feelings intentionally
Things I shouldn't have done that I regret now
mm
um
good with my ex
"I could have ended it better, so we could be on better terms now."
I probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to incite so many things that I should have just let go with the river and just see how it got out
The hardest decision I've ever had to make was
Man I really don't know
um
My father has to go through the surgery and see how he suffers.
"Well, he had a tumor he had to remove."
"So it was just hard to see him in bed and just be in the hospital if he really didn't want to be there because he's a real living person and he'd rather run around and stuff, but just seeing him stuck in bed was just awful"
Uh me and my family aren't very close we're not
"I mean, they were always there for me and I appreciate it, but we never had this close connection < collection> connection <con> connection around"
especially since they're strangers so they don't really understand where I'm trying to get out
have grown up
America so it is quite different when it comes to these cultural <cu> racially I mean the cultural boundaries that we somehow take a step across each other's feet on
"But apart from that, we have a decent relationship when we talk to each other, it's kind of embarrassing, but it's okay."
I think they're out of control.
"I think they're learning things they shouldn't know at this age, I think they're doing things they shouldn't do"
"and I don't feel that enough people are telling them they shouldn't, I feel like they're applauded"
from the media they are applauded by celebrities to whom they follow
"and there's not enough done, and they just get lost"
"Depends on the night on some nights, it's pretty hard for me to fall asleep like a baby."
usually creative actually
"If I can't sleep, I just stay up and write something or read a book and ideas will pop up."
"These things are usually good when I can't sleep, it's nothing bad because I have bad thoughts or something."
To lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments when I'm energetic and I'm live
"then a few nights a few days where I'm just you know, just sit there"
only gently thinking
not like my life itself
"I don't know that it's always been the case that these ups and downs always have, but they balance each other."
no
no
The last time I felt really happy was
hm
today
"From the moment I woke up, it was a beautiful sunny day."
i
went to a few friends we had a good time in school
had some good grades on some papers to write a good essay
feel quite successful and
I feel like my day is just
a good day
my best friend would describe me as strange <Laughter>
most people would describe me as strange
I say a lot of strange things that I do strange things that I'm interested in things that most people aren't.
um
just like old literature
For revolutionary stuff
Uh things about the change of the world
but
by subterranean means
um
"No, I don't live a life of regret"
Fear can never stop you from doing something
"Um, I'm just reading around with some friends."
ride around and find something to do just on an adventure
"I don't wish I could change something about myself, I just wish I could build myself into the person I really should be."
um
this once I and my best friend got into an argument
"And she pointed to all the things I've done, that I shouldn't have done, all at once"
"how I hurt the people, how I hurt them"
the wise men I've done to them who have been brutal
and it just made me feel bad when I reflect on everything
My Parents
"I mean, although we don't see eye to eye, they always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day"
Although I never listen to her or I don't choose to listen to her
"when it happens, I learned from it and I'm like oh that's what my parents told me"
"so I learned to trust them more and I learned,"
understand that they are wiser than me and they know more than me
I don't travel so much around l_a anymore
"try to see new sights, but as far as I don't travel outside"
to discover new things to discover things you never knew they were there
or the limitless possibilities
to discover I like to discover new people
New cultures
new things that go against the normal for us and for me
A few days ago
I just drove into the middle of the desert
and I just sat there
and I just enjoyed everything the desert had to offer and it was just pleasant
I felt free from all this
these cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be outside
In the middle of nowhere at a completely random time
It felt good
I'm very proud that I've always been different.
that despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird or I'm weird or I think strange things
I have always maintained my original mentality
