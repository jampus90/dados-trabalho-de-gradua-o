Yes
"I'm fine, thank you."
I'm from los closeles

well the most important thing I like the weather around I like the lifestyle I like about the diversity of the beach around snow
we all have it
Some things I don't like about l_a around
the rent is much too expensive it is ridiculous
I'm on my way.
"I enjoy seeing new places, going new places, it's different, everywhere people are different."
It's fun.
okay good the last one last year I went to the family reunion in new Orleans so that was in June
"and around, while I was there, we also visited Diall louisiana for the around"
the swamp tours
"and vicksburg mississippi where my mother is and we spent the night in ferriday ousiana with my aunt, the hundred and one"
this year in May
"Um, there's a lot to do."
as far as travelling or only time
I don't know if it's just one.
"Probably, if"
"I traveled with my father, since I have a lot of my travels from"
"Um yeah, it was bus car sometimes planes uh mostly, which only I think I'll say mostly in the south, but it was"
really funny
especially the roadtrips
mhm
only general and also dramatic
"Well, my dream job is"
becoming a real estate investor
"Well, I've really been doing it for two thousand five years, I just don't have the capital right now, or the connections that..."
"Since I like real estate, I'll just start as a real estate agent"
So I should have my license sometime this year.
Outward
"Well, I'm not shy, it could be a little bit of both, but I'm pretty outgoing"
"To speak well of Hawaii, I have uh live there for a year and a half, but what I do to relax is either to usually take a nap <Laughter>"
to take a bath
To or just try to get things out of my head and try to spend my energy in a more positive way
"It's got to be worked on, but..."
I know when to control it.
When I have to
um
"Well, me and my ex-husband still come into arguments around it was just over a text message but"
"Actually, it was my fault, but usually it's his, but it starts little and kind of snowballs out of control, but"
This is usually the way it works
um
All right.
"I don't know what else to do except pray for it because I thought if I moved into another house it would have passed, but I see that we're still in it"
"So, I don't know, maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right, then let him be right I think"
um
"Probably a few things, but I don't regret anything I've done in my life, but..."
I wish I had behaved differently.
"somehow everything in my life almost <Laughter> I could have done it differently or I would have if I had the chance, but I don't worry about it because I don't regret what I've done in my life"
"the most difficult decision to make, probably, if I had to get a divorce,"
"mm, which were perhaps the hardest or one of the hardest decisions"
It was just a lot...
a lot of things through the years around < clears throat> the relationship had somehow deteriorated around
if the relationship
between us was still good
then the things he did to
I would have been able to overlook it a little more because I have the feeling of how good our relationship is good and
"it is difficult to find a really good relationship, but since our relationship deteriorates and there is only a lot of disagreement and dispute and"
"He's got financial problems, and he's doing it like that."
"I just decided to just forget it, I mean, I tried, but..."
You know he didn't want to cooperate.
um
"Well, I'm happy with what's going on now, I mean, I wish we could still be a family, but since that's not going to happen, yes I'm happy with my life right now, yes"
um
something I can delete around
I don't think I really need to delete anything.
"I've finally talked about the way the kids treated me at school, but except that I don't think of anything to erase"
"It's a fair slash good, there's no problems, so I guess I'm just saying good, yeah, there's no problems"
"Well, I'd have to tell my mother"
Yes
"Well, she's always supported me and"
"everything I've done, whether it's"
"Good or not so good, so I think that's a blessing"
mhm
Sometimes it's not sometimes
"Well, I just don't get enough hours of sleep, I guess that's what it is, how I like to sometimes"
So that's more the problem I'd like to get
mhm
only sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling as if I want to take a nap
I feel good.
mhm
"No, they were about the same."
no
no
umm really happy uh probably last week because I had a little money so < laugh>
I guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe mine for a conversational girlfriend I've known since ninety six.
I really wouldn't do it.
"I'm not gonna say I don't think he's a best friend, but we're not really hanging out so much, but he's very generous to me and my mother"
mhm
so
um
"Well, now I'm spending my weekends doing tasks and teaching and teaching."
but maybe after the class work is out of the way around <Laughter> maybe I can do something else
"Um, good to myself, I wish that..."
Sometimes I could put my temper a little more and naturally I would like to lose weight
to be a little more active and I wish my skin would clean up
It was probably when I was in school. The school years are terrible for many people because the children are animals.
They're trying to make you feel like you're not like you.
"Piece of dirt under the foot, so this is probably the last time as an adult no"
"I'd say I'm real, I'm honest, I support"
And I'm just a good friend
no
About 20 years ago
"Just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you're eating for two, and you can eat a lot of food, as you're told."
"That's the main thing, I'll tell my daughters, no."
"just eat as you normally eat, but eat healthier, there is no need to gain eighty pounds if"
the baby is only twenty pounds or less and you have to lose all this weight
"To even though I came into some money now twenty years ago, I probably just thought about shopping or"
I'd only spend it on frivolous stuff while I'd invest it now.
"So yes, I think that's what this is about <Laughter>"
around proud of uh <sigh>
"Mm, I guess maybe myself..."
My children
k thank you
See you.
