"Yes, I am."
I'm doing very well today.
I'm originally from Chicago illinois
"When I was three, I moved out of here."
Yes
I'll never go back
Family affairs
it depends on what you are in
if you notice
about the fast life and Hollywood that doesn't compare it at all
"If you're into the cold weather, you'd rather be out there, I like the sun."
I'm going to...
My mom and dad broke up.
It's okay.
I have no idea I was only three when I moved here.
I like the sunshine
I like the weather I like the balance of the weather we have in spring winter
Autumn and and and summer I like the beaches I like hollywood
I like that the sailors are here and
and
"<Laughter> I love people it's a different kind, I think"
"l_a is a microcosm of the united states, the people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and from all over the world, they come to l_a for a better opportunity, so that's what I like about l_a"
"Oh, gang violence"
< slaughter>
no not really I once traveled to Arizona and once to Stockton California
"and another time to barstow California, but I don't travel much right now especially because of the finances"
I studied alcohol and drug counseling
"I just felt it in my I just felt it in my heart that what I should do with my life help people to overcome their addiction, so"
um
that was a kind of simple choice I got some advice from people and
I just walked in.
just to see what it was
and
I finished school and
have an intership and has been hired and so
I think that's what I'm supposed to do with my life.
"I'm not working right now, I actually moved away and"
I had to take a deep breath
"I was married and we had to move because the rent was cheaper, so I had to give up the job."
to take this step
"but since I came back down, I've been filling out applications and sending resume and trying to get interviews so that I can get back into the consultation"
All right.
It can sometimes be very difficult because
um
I have a felony uh and so I can't work with the youth and I can't work with the elderly
and but the normal dopes I can
"and then you need to be certified and I'm not yet certified, you need to work a certain amount of hours to be certified before they even allow you to do the test, you need to work a certain amount of hours"
"So right now, I'm just trying to get interns you know, try to help interns and show people what I can do as a consultant because everything about me isn't seen on my resume and around"
"Yes, they just want people to be certified in order not to be certified in order to experience"
and the fact that I have a felony makes it difficult
<Laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility
um
or as an author
You know that the <de> depends
That depends on
on persons who are primarily:
"Adaptation of my personality to the people I am around when people are kick then I will be kick when they are standoffish, then I may seem shy, but I'm not shy, I just give them their space and allow them to decide when they want to open"
"But if people open up right away, I'll open up right away."
< slaughter>
I mainly listen to music or
I'll watch youtube
Writing Poems
um
or I just close my eyes and just lie down and pretend I can sing what I can't.
So <Laughter> that's
And another thing I do is
I eat ice cream <Laughter>
"Controls my temperament, I'm very good at it it depends on what it is, I have to say that"
"The last time I lost my temper, it was because I felt it was someone."
"to scare my mother, so I lost my temper, but ninety-nine times from a hundred"
"I don't lose my temper, I don't like to raise my voice and"
"I like to be calm and cool and I like that everyone feels comfortable, I don't want anyone to be scared or anything, there's no reason that someone's scared and that we're angry and"
You know we're skipping our frustrations with people who had nothing to do with it.
I just think that
and I think angry outbursts to be a link around
"heart problems and high blood pressure, so I definitely don't want"
"Well, I just told you about um."
It was my mother's husband and
to tell you the truth
"I could have handled it differently, but when I saw the look in my mom's eyes, I just lost him and I grabbed myself."
"You know, I told my mother, um, I don't like it."
"I've seen this guy abuse my mother, but that's her husband and so I kept my distance in her relationship, but when I saw how she was afraid in her eyes, that triggered a part of me."
the
I don't like very much because I know if I get angry I usually stay angry for a long time so
I should have just left.
"I should have just gone and then gone home and rest and get up the next morning, went to church, but..."
yes we had a great time explosion and that caused and that caused a lot of damage for about six to nine months
so
"Yes, these six nine months I can't go back"
Yes
"Well, my brother's in prison, and I haven't seen him in 20 years since he's been there, and my sister moved to Chicago for twenty years."
"Thirteen years ago, I haven't seen her since, so I'm just close to my mother."
and
my son I haven't seen him in five years and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and
"How this is going to go out for me, I just know you know that I have a small family and"
"I have family in Chicago, but"
I don't know.
To snoop around the side of the family just because...
of what I have seen
"and heard, so I just don't want it to happen to me at all, so I just keep my distance"
Someone who had a positive influence <inf>
I'd say influence in my life
Scrubbed_entry
taught me how to control my temperament and how to express my emotions without expressing my feelings that threaten someone else.
and
taught me how
"how to monitor my feelings and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and if they are really strong, then I just have to be quiet until"
that intense fizzling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not only emotionally
and of course he is
he was the one who encouraged <enc> told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol consultant to get him
Twenty-seven years clean and sober at the moment he lived on Skid-Row and he was the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something I'll never forget
feel guilty about
my grandfather
um died in two thousand four
and
At that time I just got out of prison
"about two thousand two, I just came out of prison and he came to me and he"
told me in so many words that he wouldn't be there that long.
but I didn't get it because I had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was full of things that I considered more important than that
plus the fact that I didn't understand what he said
but
when he died
I found out he told me.
"that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go, but I couldn't see it then"
and
I feel
I think about it all the time
something I can erase from my memory
What are you doing?
would be the day
my brother I beat my mother again and again that over and over and over again in my head and it's like
this is a memory that I can just walk without
"over and over and over again and over again in my head, so yeah on that day that memory right there"
I felt contradictory feelings
because on the one hand
"On the one hand, my brother protected me"
received from Beat
And on the other side he hit my mother
so
was somehow in the middle
Most nights I have not
I'm going to sleep maybe three in the morning and I'm probably more than likely until seven in the morning so I don't get much sleep
It depends on the environment I'm in when I don't sleep well.
"I'll be irritable at some point, but it doesn't happen immediately, it depends on my environment and who's around me when there are difficult people who will be a challenge for me and..."
"When people are loose, no one will know I haven't gotten much sleep."
how I've felt lately
I just feel like...
the
It'll be better for me soon.
To make some better decisions
"to take advantage of the opportunities that come to mind, take advantage of my talents and meet the right people"
"This can open the right doors for me, so I'm very excited about it, even if it doesn't happen, I'll send out a million resumes"
I don't care if I get it.
"Five interviews, I'll never stop because I know that a consultant is my life's job"
and
and I'm also meant to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people
"to know about me because I had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and I have a lot of humanity to offer, so it's just a matter of time before"
um
That the public is exposed to what I've collected
my behavior I'm gentler
to laugh more humorous
I let a lot of things go that I'm always just
Let me check it out.
"and angry me and things I can't control, like trying to control people or trying to make sure people don't betray me and"
You just can't control me thinking I'm mentally mature.
and psychologically eh
and the
The acquisition of a sense of humor was a big breakthrough for me
so
"I know that my thoughts have changed and my thoughts have changed my behavior, I still have to monitor it."
"my thoughts and behavior I still have to monitor, but overall I am"
You know.
"Back then, I tolerated myself."
actually like me and around it will erhove <beh> behoove you
the same way to feel
"No, I didn't."
no
Last time I felt happy was last night because the Lakers won the basketball game
< slaughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
"my best friend would describe me, he calls me the truth"
"Because I always tell the truth and people try to hide things and I always reveal it, they can't hide it from me around I have a statement that says I see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it"
"and I see things days and months before they start to happen, I know human behavior when I see it"
and I sniff it out really well and it's just a gift that was given to me so that he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people
"to get clean with me, because when they look at me, they know that I see through them"
as I said like a clear glass with nothing in it and
"Yes, that's why he calls me the truth <Laughter>"
um
I wish I never had
I wish I'd never gone to jail.
"I wish,"
that I could change
All right.
my economic status my employment status
and
"my teeth, which is like a problem area for me, I have a lot"
Stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and I didn't care about my teeth and now that I have to be
um
Trust about myself as I can be you know it always comes
"I wonder if they look at my teeth, I wonder if they look at my teeth, I never get the sign <si> I never get the impression that they are, but in the back of my mind there are those thoughts that say"
"look at my teeth, so I would really"
"to change that and I would change my height, I think I'd like to be"
"at least thirty-five pounds heavier, but I'm working on it."
"Twenty years ago, which would make me eighteen"
I would have had a big time around high school basketball players for Fremont High School at that time and I had colleges coming to see me and I would have given myself the opportunity
was away from the troublemakers because I didn't and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils and who knows i
"could have played for the Lakers last night, but"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
I am very proud of the fact that
You know what I'm most proud of my mother?
really
really
um
She graduated from school.
"She had a full - time job, a full - time job, where she woke up."
Five o'clock in the morning
go to work
at three thirty of her job to go straight to college leaving college at nine o'clock a night she does this five days a week
"and still had the power to keep them on the list of deans and presidents, so that all this"
You know when they say xxx
"that older people can't do things, I just think that this rumor scatters around"
and she recently got her around license as an evangelist in the Church so
I'm just very proud of it and...
Your Life Influenced People

<Laughter> okay thanks
Goodbye.
