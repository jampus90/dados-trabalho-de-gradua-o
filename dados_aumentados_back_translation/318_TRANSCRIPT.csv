"mm recently, what have I done"
At New Year's Eve party I had the time of my life it was so funny
I was at a party at a friend's house in the Baldwin Hills area on the eve of this new year.
he had it in a pretty nice house it's a three-storey house and it was like
"three hundred fifty people in there it was pretty funny, but it wasn't that funny either, because there were so many people and you couldn't really move like that."
"that was the only downfall, but besides, I brought my new year in big with tons of friends and"
That's how it's supposed to be done.
"I'm usually in good mood every day I wake up brings me in good mood I think you could say that, but"
um
I don't know a good meal <Laughter>
<makes clicking sounds with mouth> ooh one of my most memorable experiences were probably
"When I was younger, I was with the Scouts and we camped all the time and a year we went to"
yellowstone or yosemite one of these places and we had to work on a mountain bike merit badge and
"Of course I'm out of town like a mountain bike I can ride a mountain bike, but"
once we got in the real mountains on real mountain bikes
I won a new respect for the mountain bikers it was nice it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about forty-five miles per hour in dirt on a bike was pretty intense and that was I'll never forget that
I don't know that it's hard to answer what I'm most proud of.
I don't know.
See you.
