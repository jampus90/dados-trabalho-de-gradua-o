value
<sync>
Yes
I'm doing good.
I was born in lynwood
I like all the sights and all the
Clothes and shops they have
"Well, some things all the graffiti around"
basically all the wrong
criminal activity and all that bad stuff
I've traveled in the past.
I'm not really going out of the state
in principle
budget money money budget expenditure not
Limit me to go to another state
I studied automotive engineering
and welding
just a passion for cars since I was small
uh
always in principle
just wanted to work on cars
Pretty
"Yeah, I love working on cars."
My dream job would probably be
Probably to own my own
a workshop for the repair of motor vehicles; or
to own a barber shop
or basically only one
Probably a Master Welder
Think of me as a bit out of date
just because I like to have fun uh
Just having fun with my friends
able to do everything I ask
basically just smoking on my spare time sometimes or
Just lie down and watch a movie that listens to music.
basically hip-hop music
or maybe
a good comedy movie
"Uh, pretty easy about that."
I don't really know.
"let go, let my bad side come to my emotions"
Probably earlier today about with my girlfriend
or woman basically about where we're going to eat
felt desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to eat
"because she didn't think so well,"
Uneasiness
"probably just to relax and stay calm, more than just to burst and raise my voice"
Misconduct in my past basically everything I could have changed
mm to improve myself
basically uh
"to do something better in a job that, or maybe"
I don't do the job at my biggest
The hardest decision would have to be
uh
to plan a family probably
just basically
to ensure that all situations are where they should be and
Talk to my partner about it
when we're really ready to start a family
♪ Empty the throat ♪
only basically
the love and bond between me and my wife
um
basically like an accident could be
Basically
Pretty horrific
terrifying experience
as uh I almost collapsed
the motorway barrier
and the car pulled out and it basically almost landed from a small hill
"It was a pretty scary experience, as far as"
only uh in a car alone not able to control the vehicle
I just hope I'm okay.
it's pretty easy except if I had a good dinner
early in my day would go pretty well to sleep
only restless and just a little more stressed constant things more
I'd be on my heart
"Lack of energy, perhaps"
xxx quite relaxed quiet
not really just the same old
day after day only
"try to stay happy and relaxed calm, just try to stay positive energy"
no I have not been getting on
no I was not diagnosed with depression
"Um, earlier today when I had something to eat"
It's pretty close.
It was good.
we talk about a lot of necessary things trying to help each other at any time
my father my sister
my mother
"Well, my father's been there as long as my mother"
they have given me as much as possible from school to
"Clothes to take me to my sister, she's basically"
"She graduated from college, so she's like a"
a mentor for me looks up to her as far as
Graduation of the school and everything trying to go further
You're pretty funny.
They're basically just smarter outbursting heads
It seems to be somehow.
More advanced thinking
Compared to what the children probably think back in old age
they learn things a little faster
uh no not mainly
only things I could have thought I could have done
better or
or just a little different
uh how to build my car differently
um
Received
Infringements of traffic
basically just uh
I wish I would.
by crossings; or
I got all the tickets I got on my record.
"Yeah, that's good."
I would have basically
right after you try it for the first time not to do it again
so that the same error does not happen
uh
just my person a kind of as far as uh
when I'm angry
only for:
find a way to be easier
Maybe try
not so much of a negative thinker in times when things become a little more difficult
♪ Empty the throat ♪
uh
"Basically, if someone"
"accusing you,"
Misconduct that probably hasn't happened yet
um
"basically, when a policeman tells you that you did wrong when you know clearly that you did not do"
Is something wrong?
Probably early this year
in principle
A policeman put me on because he thought I was a drunk driver.
I felt really stupid about myself or tried to blame myself for having drunk and smoked when that wasn't the cause
I was just very tired at night it was twelve a_m
Therefore:
"I tried, I probably saw a little sleepy"
Just...
Fun cool
"a relaxed, good attitude"
loyal <l> xxx loyal
um
Drifting drifting my two forty s_x to spend quality time with my wife and children
um
in principle
everything I did for myself when I graduated from high school so far
Thank you.
See you.
