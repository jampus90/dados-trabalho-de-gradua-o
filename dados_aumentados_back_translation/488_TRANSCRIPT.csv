oh san fernando tal
I like the culture I love to go to museums and go at night and have lots of people.
It's a lot spread out and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive anywhere and not over a good public transport system
"Uh not really I like to go camping, but I don't really travel"
I think I was on a geology class six months ago.
"Yeah, it was fun."
hmm <sigh>
I think it's hard to say
"Well, I think the first time I went camping was probably really memorable I went to the Death Valley"
and I have a lot of really cool things to see and hang out with my friends at night
Philosophy
Yes
um
hmm
"I don't know, I think it just happened that I wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then I kind of got disappointed and I liked"
all the different
Ways or all the different things I could do with philosophy
What are you doing?
"I don't know, but I really like kids and I like"
"To study your behavior, so I think something along these lines could be"
"I think I'm usually pretty outgoing I tend to be shy about my family, but if I'm close to friends and stuff i"
I think I'm pretty friendly
Many times I will watch or read t_v
um
"Yeah, that's good."
I think I'm pretty good I'm not getting really angry I'm trying to think about it
other things when I start to get crazy or...
I'm just trying to focus on my breathing
"I think the last time I had a fight with someone, it was probably with my boyfriend."
But I'm having trouble remembering what was the last thing we were arguing about.
I think it was <wa> I didn't feel very good and I had difficulty deciding if I wanted to go to his department at the end of the year party
and he got frustrated
"which I thought was very reckless, because I didn't feel well to start with"
I had the feeling that he didn't really consider my feelings and
i
really hate when he gets stressed or gets slightly angry because I see that as unnecessary and it emphasizes me out
hmm
I think many times when my
oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother
Uh does something wrong I tend too hard with him uh we're not so close
as my sister and me or my youngest brother and me
"And so he tends to be hostile back, and I think if I was a little gentler, it might be easier to communicate with him."
hmm
um
When I was nineteen
I came home.
by a party
I think at four o'clock in the morning on a Sunday morning and my father got really angry at me and yelled at me saying a lot of not very nice things
and then he didn't talk to me for a year
"Well, my relationship with my mother is much better now that I don't live at home."
"I was very frustrated with her all the time because she has a very fast temperament, but I think now that I have a little more distance, I can see that she did the best she could"
To <sigh>
and I love my siblings i
again my little sister and I really get along well she's
four years younger than me
and when
"when she was at twelve and I was at sixteen, it was really difficult because she had a really hard temper and she was always moody and"
It wasn't me.
"in a place to be patient with this kind of stuff, so we fought all the time, but we no longer"
And that's really great
and
we get along well with my uh
"my older little brother, who is fifteen and I think I'm getting pretty good with my youngest brother, who is twelve"
Scrubbed_entry
one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and I really loved their classes and it was really good
Uh in a class with a professor who really cared and
"who really hired people who were really motivating, as not all my classes were so"
"I think it's pretty easy, I mean sometimes I have trouble sleeping, but"
"Usually it's not that bad, I think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning."
um
"Well, I'm really tired I can get grumpy"
but I think I'm usually just
groggy
"pretty good, I'm a little worried about"
um
about getting a job and I'm going to summer school over
"It's just a class, so I have a lot of free time."
um
"Yeah, that's good."
"- Yeah, that's good."
"I mean, it's not the end of the world when I don't get a job, but I know that after all, I usually think I just don't try to think too much about it and I don't try to be pessimistic"
no
no
hmm
"Well, I think the last time I felt really happy I"
went to a party with my friend at the end of the department party
and
"I was the one you know I knew some people there, so I felt comfortable, but I was also able to meet new people"
and there were a few kids there squirting around in the pool and I had some drinks and ate something to eat and it was fun
She would probably say that
I'm smart and uh
quite intellectually I love to read and see
really like serious movies and t_v
um
and she would probably also say that I'm fun because we like to go out and have a lot of fun
"Well, I'm kind of, um, I can really be disorganized, and that sometimes gets me into trouble like that."
"So that's a great one, the and procrastination"
hmm
I had a bit of trouble a few months ago and had to go to court and was uh
if you use:
eh
"sixty hours of community service and of course I procrastinated on doing so, so I had to show in court again to get an extension and the judge was"
"very mean and he didn't seem I mean he screamed me, but it didn't seem"
as he thought it seemed like it was just some kind of supply
"Talk he gave to everyone he thought needed, so I understand that, because that's his job."
But it was
has not been taking place
great for me because I wasn't I was really scared in this situation
"Well, I would have been twelve."
and two
um
but I think
"I think I would have told myself when I was 12, not being so hard on myself and not being so hard on my parents because I think"
I was a little selfish and self-involved back then
"I can't think of anything, I regret how I treated my mother when I was a child, but everyone does that and"
um
I regret it.
a few of
Before semesters I didn't get so good at school and I got a
a few ws I have to work now to get on my transcript
I think I'm
I think I'm...
I didn't concentrate at school at the time.
and I haven't seen any counselors at school or anything so I could definitely have done that
I think I'd spend my ideal weekend on Saturday and then
"Walking or maybe just going to the duck pond at my house, feeding ducks and picking oranges"
and then maybe
go shopping for breakfast Sunday and just like windows
and maybe a little t_v
What are you doing?
my youngest brother is autistic and my mother and father always worked when he grew up.
I'm ten years older than him.
"And as the oldest I always took care of him,"
"made me really patient because he was a handful, but I'm really proud of how he developed and"
and how close we are
