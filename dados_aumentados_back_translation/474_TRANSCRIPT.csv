there are more uh things to do out in the mountains

"Yeah, I love it here"
"It took me about a year to feel really comfortable, but"
um
"once that came through this kind of hard year, it was pretty good out here I've had a good time"
For the
Love that I can go to the beach
I love that it's warm most of the time.
I love that I've met a lot of people who love the arts as much as I do.
traffic just like any other
um
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yes, the traffic and"
It's pretty much just traffic
Earthquake
not as much as I want
It's just nice to go to a new place.
experience something else
around xxx I went to alaska a few years ago and that was really awesome
"I have to go fishing in the ocean and I got seasick, that wasn't great, but uh"
it was cool I saw a bear in real life a bear walked through a yard
It was really different than it was really cool
< slaughter>
English creative writing
I've always wanted to tell stories.
it just made sense to work on writing in some way
"Yes, I am."
to
have my own t_v show where I write it and everyone looks at it every week and it's awesome
really hard
Because there are a lot of people who have the same dream.
"Yeah, that's good."
more outgoing than shy
"I like talking to people, I enjoy other people"
Go to the movies or
Turn on music dance
pretty good
around <sigh> it was at work couple about a month ago <ag> about a month ago
"Um, I've got"
angry with someone because I didn't think they gave me clear instructions
"And when I tried to have a conversation about it, they got angry and then I got angry and"
we got crazy
I felt like I wasn't being heard or heard and
I felt that we were not able to have a real dialogue.
"Because we couldn't have a dialogue, I felt like no one was listening to me."
Total
um
<makes sounds with mouth>
- I don't know.
i i um
"No, no <Laughter> regrets <Laughter>"
I guess...
hmm
"I don't know if there's one, I mean, I'm sure there's one, but"
"Once I went after someone, and they cut me off."
and
"I think it was just one of those days, like a year ago or two years ago."
It was just one of those days when I just didn't want to.
"or I was just a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and I almost got into an accident with them, I just followed them to their parking lot"
and
"Actually, I pissed on her and they pissed me off."
and so it really came to me under the skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh
And then turn me off
"So I followed them to the place and I asked, I told Miss, why did you turn me off when you cut me off?"
And she said oh you know I'm
"I had a hard day, I don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and I told her well that you're not really a good example for your daughter and you know,"
"I didn't have to be so petty, but I just wanted to"
I guess I wanted to be.
"Oh, oh, oh, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi."
<Laughter>um
"Oh, I guess the hardest decision was to come to my mom's uh"
To tell her that I was gay
"I mean, it wasn't hard because it was the right one, but it was hard to do because my mother was very conservative and she"
"She had difficulty accepting it and it took a while, but once she knew everything was better and I knew it would be"
"But it was hard at the moment,"
You know you're telling her something she didn't want to hear.
All right.
um
"When I was a little kid, my..."
My grandfather found our dog run over on the road
and he uh
Scrubbed_entry
and brought it in and I think I just remember when I was a kid
"to see death like this, really only"
threw me away and
uh scared me and
"It was just one of those moments for which I guess I wish I hadn't been there because my grandmother was destroyed, she was just so sad"
and uh
"It was just one of those moments that I think you need as a child, but I didn't really want to experience like loss in your face"
"Yeah, that's good."
my relationship with my family is pretty good around
we're probably not as close as most but uh we
you know that we always
"we don't talk often, but we talk with love and we"
always love each other when we see each other
um
my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me
"to uh you know, pursue my dreams and"
"Not to let the little things get me down, so I'm glad I had them"
"Usually it's easy, sometimes it's not"
um
"Well, I've been between jobs recently I'm starting a new job uh next week"
but
"While I was away while I wasn't working, I tend to"
my body wants to stay up later and later and I try not to like
fall into the pattern of walking to sleep like two or three and rise like eleven
So I try to let myself sleep by midnight or twelve thirty.
and I just end up lying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half
when I should
"I should be able to just sleep and get up like nine, but"
I guess I still want to stay up.
"Uh a little scattered, like today I'm a little scattered, because uh"
I tried to go to sleep early and I ended up throwing and turning and
So <sigh> scattered <laughter>
"Now that I had a lot of time on my hands, as if I didn't usually have so much time on my hands, it can sometimes be frustrating because"
You don't know what to do with it if you don't work.
but
"Yeah, that's good."
I think that answers the question
To me just that maybe a little more absent than usual just lately with uh the not working thing
no
mm mm mm
A few days ago when I got my new job when I was hired
um
Outgoing Listening
Uh attentive
um
Fun
Loyal
I think
I hope
I wish that I
I wish I looked better. I wish I had more hair up here mm and would have lost it a little bit.
Uh probably wish I was a little skinnier that
This belt is quite tight <Laughter> and around
"You know, sometimes I wish I had more money, but..."
nothing too drastic
I'm fine.
"Yeah, that's good."
"Oh, uh,"
When I was a little kid
I was the fat kid.
and
God I remember I was like going to high school
and it was like the second day
And I remember this guy came to me and was
um
how he was like pretty nice to me I thought
and I didn't know that he
"As if it were from a movie, just like he had put Bandaids on my back, who said I was a fat cow."
and said how uh like
"Yeah, that's good."
like a bunch of mean things and I didn't know it and I walked around with him for half an hour I heard people laughing and I didn't get it and then finally this girl just came to me and was like hey
"There's like bandaids on your back saying all these mean things and then she just walked away, she didn't want to help me take them away"
"and I remember how I couldn't get it, I tried to find it and then"
um
I just remember how to put my head in my locker and how
"I didn't want anyone to see me cry, so I put my head in my locker."
"and as if I were looking at things in my backpack, but really I was you know"
the crying fat child who couldn't get the mean stickers from his back
- Yeah.
anything
um
likely
"Yeah, that's good."
<sharp inhalation>
um
you know
I would xxx I would try to keep
I would try to let myself know to look at things positively and not like worrying about what other people think about you
I think I spent too much time like a teenager
Worrying what people thought of me
"and when I got older, I didn't care so much and I started to enjoy life so much more"
Uh I went to coachella it's a music festival it's been three days with
all my friends and my friend and we
Uh we danced and we went swimming and we grilled and we laughed and had a great time
"Yeah, that's good."
"Oh, um, I guess my"
my career modest as it may be
I really spend a long time in l_a
When it was uh
when it was hard I stayed < stay> I stayed around I didn't stop so
"You know, I'm proud that I managed to follow my dreams and really stay out here and"
try to do it in Hollywood
It's my pleasure.
See you.
See you.
See you.
