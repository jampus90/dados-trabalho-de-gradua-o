It's not really hard because it's fun.
and it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time
the uh you know that this was a great revelation to me that you can relax and concentrate at the same time because usually when I relax I'm tuning out
"I'm focusing on something else, but..."
"To be able to combine these sensations, uh yeah I did this for"
Uh three months now so
"Yes, it is."
um
almost too good at times <Laughter> uh sometimes uh there are things that should be said
that I don't
Just because
"You know, it's like opening a can of worms, maybe one of your friends, for example, I have a problem with him, but they don't have a problem with him, necessarily because he didn't do anything to them."
And I had to deal with that somehow in the past.

"You know we weren't the same priorities, and I was very excited."
That was the end
To <sigh>
I felt
Good thing it was definitely that you know that a choice had been made on both parties
uh also regretting that you know that he doesn't
feel how I wanted him to feel about what was excited about the project so
the fact that he wasn't really in it somehow pissed me off
"Um, but..."
I got over it.
"Um, and you know, I've got some other people who are really excited to work with me, you know, even honored."
so

I'll keep going.
Thank you.

But I did.
I regret it

you know
xxx You know that life happens that you make some mistakes
Selfishness
To be young and think it doesn't matter
um
you know
Thinking
You know that you only live once and
You know for any time it was probably the best thing to end up because you know I love my current girlfriend and I would never do that with her so
"that was years ago, but"
She was a nice girl she didn't deserve.
I regret it
< Deep breath>
um
"Shit, man."
"I guess whether to go to college or not, because I had some projects that I didn't really want."
"Shut down, I had a band where we had a manager."
We played a lot and I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep doing that or go to school and start over.
and
I made the decision to go to school in Santa Cruz and start a new life there for four years and
"It was a difficult decision, but"
I'm glad I did it because I've met a lot of people I'm still very close to today.

I'd be happier if it wasn't there.
It's positive.
They sometimes support me because they give me a hard time.
they
I don't think so.
"I'm keeping things up about how I'm going to support myself, even though I'm doing it, it's just..."
You know I have a
a bigger picture than they do and I have confidence in myself and
the creative projects that I do so
"Yeah, that's good."
There's a little tension.
Just because
"You know they expect certain things from me, and I expect them too, but"
I just have a different way of doing it than they might prefer
But they're cute people.
How can I deal with them?
They know they're lovely people in their core.

"Unless it's about something that matters to me, like music or the arts, it's just very hard,"

For example:
And you know I'm trying to make myself a psyche to give me shit.
"It makes me sick, you know, maybe I have a red bull or something and you know xxx my body doesn't want that in the morning it just"

"Well, yeah, I..."
"I want to go back to therapy, it could help."
