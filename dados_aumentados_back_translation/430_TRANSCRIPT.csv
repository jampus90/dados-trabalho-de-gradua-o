value
<sync>
"Yeah, sure."
"I'm fine, thank you."
I'm from los closeles
"Well, you can't beat the weather"
Ahem and
I just think the familiarity of home makes me feel comfortable here
Smog
uh
"rudeness even though it's not compared to New York, it's"
To <Laughter> people can be unbearable if they are rude
"not as much as I've wanted it lately, that I've traveled more in the past, but not lately."
"I just think seeing different places, it's..."
"New things learn, uh, to find things that are fascinating that culminate in my interest"
um
Let's see.
"I think <Laughter> spoke of New York earlier I think the first time I went to New York I was pretty surprised I know it's still only in America, but I just think about"
"Being from l_a, I didn't think anything or any city could be bigger"
"and more uh like say uh ostentatious than New York, but uh"
It was quite an experience and I didn't think any place...
"I didn't think any place was more dirty than downtown, but I think times < time> I think < battle> times square has hit us"
To mention too many I don't even know where to start
Suppose it depends on the situation
um
I like walking I like playing to uh I like reading with my dogs uh
"Uh everything I think I could just leave sitting still and leave my mind empty I know reading requires some concentration, but uh"
You just know I don't have to try too hard to relax.
<Sigh>
"in the past I had problems, but I'm getting better <Laughter> let's just say that <Laughter>"
ah probably arguing with my roommate
"But a few days ago, uh"
"that happens, we're friends uh it's a loving argument < laughter> if you"
I met this roommate about six seven years ago.
um
somehow moved in the same social circles and just got out
"It's cool, I mean"
I guess you know how
"We argue we sometimes have our differences, but there's not one person I'd rather live with than she's cool"
hmm
how much time we have
Uh <Laughter>
It's just too numerous to mention.
I don't know how to answer that.
I think I'm gonna break up with a friend I really do.
cared for but knowing
knowing that it just wouldn't work...
that was very difficult
only weighed pros and cons and only thought
It just didn't want to work.
no matter how much love or care I've brought into the relationship
something was missing
and I think I invested enough time she invested enough time and
I just knew it was over.
no
"so many <Laughter> I don't have too many regrets, but things you delete from your memory"
"Oh, there's way too many, uh, to mention that I don't know how to answer that."
the same girl
I broke up with
she was the friend <Laughter> of uh a best friend of mine
They were separated for
several years
and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we're not talking I wish uh my regret is I wish I
I could have done better.
<scoff>
um
"It's funny to see me getting older, I'm not so close, but I still care about her and I still love her and I think they love me"
my mom and dad are both alive mm not much interact I'm very close to my older sister
my older sister
um
She's just
strong no nonsense uh
"She's short and yet a fireworks body and I've always liked that on her, she uh"
uh
she always makes me feel comfortable I'm like another son to her < laughter> in a way
I suppose it depends on my stress level.
um
when I have a lot in my mind
I'm having trouble sleeping and uh other times it just
"If I really need to sleep, I just need to listen to the radio reading <lis> uh watch t_v and finally I'm going to fall tired falling asleep"
"Crabbby, I suppose like everyone else..."
tired
listless you know all the normal things I suspect when someone doesn't sleep well
I feel good
mm no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
"No, I wouldn't say"
I've been
No I didn't
"Yes, I have"
I was probably diagnosed with
About five years ago
I think I always knew there was a problem.
I always knew there were a few.
I think I always knew before I got treatment that
there was a problem emotional and Hmm and many things that are very difficult to explain
"and I was tired of feeling that way, so I was looking for help"
I just think...
Lethargy uh
Uh no desire to do something uh motivation was just not there
um
"thinking, normal depression typing things uh"
um
"Social <socia> I became socially embarrassed, which was a little different for me because I grew up"
"You know, pretty talkative <Laughter>"
I know.
I'm sorry to say it again.
I think it does.
"Well, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
"I think the number one thing and that's what I'm amazed at the temperament that I think I've allowed myself to, uh,"
Retiring from certain situations
and don't take them so seriously
And do not get so tense or angry
and then react
"I think it is, it has calmed me down for the most part"
Now it's like it's becoming a routine
At first it was very difficult
when I was five years old <Laughter>
"Oh, no, if you're a kid, there's nothing really to do."
um
There's nothing that could be sad if you're a kid.
My best friend
um
I'm not a fool
"I have a dry sense of humor, so you know it."
my best friend would probably uh
I think the
"The jingle back and forth is that you usually know an insult, but you know that everything is in love."
I wish I could be taller.
I wish I could be more
"inclined to play basketball, so I then go to the n_b_a and a millionaire I know this is all unrealistic, but only honestly answer"
hmm
"everything I regret, we didn't ask until I mean, so many don't know where to start"
"mm, that's a good one."
Wow
um
I don't know.
"I know that this is a good one I would have, I would have to think about that I wouldn't answer that uh that's a good one"
Usually you're asked for
"what you'd know, how you'd feel in ten twenty years, when I look back, I don't know what advice I'd give myself."
something I really enjoyed
um
I love...
"There are several things I like to do around uh you know I uh I enjoy playing basketball i i love to watch I love watching all the sports for this matter, which really brings me joy the last couple of years was killing"
become a hobby of me is saving dogs to promote dogs and find them houses uh it's <Laughter>
I guess it's become a pretty hobby of mine and uh
sometimes I find lost dogs and I am able to find their owner and sometimes I am not so when I tell you what there is nothing <noth>
to find the owner and I found a owner last week for a little dog that I found there is no greater feeling because the man told me <Laughter> the man told me how his around
like his daughter
"or just cried when she went to give her that she could give him back, that was cool."
"I think for someone who hasn't finished high school studying in college, and that's something that"
- I don't know.
I'll take
Pride even though I don't show it or talk about it often
<Laughter> yeah
"You look like my friend Rachel, it's funny."
< slaughter>
