I can control my temper well.
"Um with my girlfriend and it was about um she was driving on the highway and uh I suggested that they come by because there were some road workers on the side and she refused to do that and stayed on the right track, so we argued a little bit about it."
It felt as if she wasn't listening to me and almost as if she was deliberately not doing what I suggested to be defiant.
