value
I'm
I feel pretty good I'm far awake I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee
"and I'm having a simple day today, so I'm just gonna chat with you, then I'm gonna go to the gym and do some errands, so I'm planning on having a nice day today."
I was born and raised in los engles
and I'm one of the few locals from here
and I went away to school and uh
but I'm one of the few natives who are actually in Los Angeles
"Yes, I am."
I like the weather
owned by a holiday home in another state
that I found too hot and humid in florida I love the weather here
"I like culture, I like diversity"
I like the familiarity
I like the beaches
Uh but I also like that only an hour and a half away you can go into the desert say palm springs palm desert
but also an hour and a half away you can go to arrowhead or big bears and go snowboarding or skiing or things like the
and I think it's a great place to live
Thank you.
All right.
more of some perhaps some of the
Things I don't like about l_a or say California in general
say how the high tax rate
which is the state tax rate up to 13 point something now
which the business here will also banish the regulations
I'm a little entrepreneur
so all regulations are clearly impacting on the business so many of my colleagues have their business according to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other Western states that are less regulated
and that's a big problem here in uh
uh california
"It really does most people don't understand, but it's uh"
"whether or not in the form of tubes, pipes or pipes"
"You know, besides high taxes, you know that there's a big immigration problem that's born and raised here, most people don't."
But it's a big tax on the social system.
and that makes our taxes
Uh so high until they really secure the borders and take care of it
So this is
"You know, but people don't really seem to want to deal with it, um, but it's clearly affecting companies because of all the other things that our taxes are so high and people are moving out of the state."
I enjoy traveling I was in sixty-six countries
and uh
I don't travel as much as I used to.
But I've already traveled a little bit.
and I learned a few languages and uh
I served it.
I'm sorry.
uh
I didn't really understand your question.
"When you said what I think you didn't understand what I said, but I'm just gonna go back and"
I was all over Europe east of Europe
Asia
South America
North Africa
around and I enjoy this and enjoy warm climate now especially where you can go and relax and there is warm water for surfing
Because the cold water makes my back stiff
and I also like to train and surf and do yoga
and train and uh
I'm trying to eat healthy and uh
It's a big part of my life.
oh
safe
to one of my favorite trips of all time I was used to seeing when I was younger how many countries I could do in a relatively short period of time say in a period of three or four weeks
"but about ten years ago we actually went to Paris and stayed about a week and really got to know the city, although I had been there about ten times."
"we got to know the city really well, which was really great, lived like a local"
and rented a small apartment and
"cooked and has our own shopping, but really"
so often I have never stayed there longer than three or four days
it has been fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city
"and it was fun, even if I grew up in l_a and read French"
There was no large Spanish-speaking population when I was younger
my mother insisted that we all have children
"take French, although Spanish would have been much more valuable, but I took French uh"
all by uh elementary junior high and uh high school
so it was nice to practice my French even though I don't remember a lot and even though I stopped speaking French
with the French
"You know, and my accent isn't the biggest, so after a few sentences, they start talking to me in English."
<Laughter> so it was a
uh
I've got a few different degrees
So uh I was a Marine Science Major as an undergraduate
and uh
That was fun.
and I also have a master
Uh Degree in Economics
and I have a degree in crisis management
so
I found her.
interesting
and uh
It was something I wanted to do
where I went to college I went to the Marine Academy to play sports
and I found it very interesting to go to school in Maryland from Southern California
"and I originally wanted to be a doctor, but"
when you start going to school
for a little change your mind
etcetera so
I'm in the wholesale trade now.
for wholesalers of furniture products
"and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago"
well you know my grandfather and recently father died so I kind of run an eighty-year-old family business
and it's
"pretty interesting, I like it that it grew up around her"
but it's different from other jobs I've had in the past
hm
actually probably my dream job I think cooking and staying at home this fun I have changed so much I enjoy cooking and staying at home
and uh
uh
I would probably like to stay home and raise children because I have a daughter
and uh
You know she couldn't spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have wished.
but I think I'd be better than saying a lot of women I know I really want to work I really like to cook and hang out in the house and take care of children
"You know I like it, I'm always part-time, but do that with pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy who would be fun to stay home and uh do that with pretty much worked most of my life"
so
"probably never happen, but it sounds like something I'd enjoy"
uh i think i'm around generally more reserved and shy with strangers
but when I meet someone or feel comfortable
I think I'm more of an extrovert.
While most strangers think I'm introverted
"but I think I'm when I feel comfortable with certain people and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be completely confident or people I've known for years either from a personal or a business situation"
and be more
introverted
"I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outer manifestation is a little shyer in general and reserved <reser> I use the term reserved"
"Oh wow, that's a great idea I had that on uh"
one of my I have uh several computers at home
And that was one of my screensavers.
I usually tend when I relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or go for a long walk or go for a long walk or go for a long walk I usually find exercise whether it is yoga or go for a long walk or go to the gym or go for a walk or go to the beach
maybe surf when the weather is warm I don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
"it gives me like a brain freezes, although I surfed for you know over thirty years"
I had
It's...
I usually find exercise helps me to relax the best
or sometimes just on the couch in front of the t_v I find very relaxing <Laughter>
"But I like this screensaver I had at home on one of my screensavers, but"
"Yeah, that was uh"
"That's it, but..."
this is one of the things that took me a number of years to master even though my relaxation skills were
"I probably didn't have the best in my twenties, but over the years"
I think I've gotten better.
at the
I think this is an important thing and I think as we mature
how we learn how to do that I wish I'd learned how to do that and
be a little more
How did you have the skills before
I think I'm pretty good I think I'm much better than how I've aged
um
"You know, i"
I'll think before I speak now
While saying twenty years ago I was more likely to act before I fought
So I could have said more things that I
"in any tense situation, whether it is personal or"
a work situation
um
"but I have never had a violent temper, but I have a temper where I fly away from the handle instead of taking a deep breath and thinking about it."
I think I'm much better at it now than I said in my teens or twenties.
"So if I think a lot of it comes from, I think the keyword is maturity"
Oh wow
"You know, I haven't really been arguing with anyone in a couple of years, which is what I used to do as a traditional"
Argument to
likely
um
My ex wife a few years ago we had a argument essentially just about my daughter
"and it was nothing violent, but it was only heated"
basically one of the reasons why we were not married our values were so different just our ideas of education
and uh just
I think that caused such a different view of life.
But I don't know if I'd call it an argument.
but it was more of just one of them let us agree to disagree
Back of head
so
I felt like I was talking to a wall
and I actually felt more angry at me that I had
"earlier in life learned that the boy that before you have married someone children with them, is the kind of discussion that people should"
"Usually have, but you don't really think about it because"
"Sometimes when we're younger, we're"
"Look at boys, how does it look that I was great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me"
But you know
I'm pretty easy to walk and I've got
different
Ideas about raising children as they did
and that was more
"not that she was wrong and I wasn't right that I was right and she was wrong, it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really"
"about these things discussed, but it was really just basic"
Reasons why we butted heads and more were not really a good match
Considering that other things looked good
You know on paper for both of us
hm
There's one that my father recently passed away.
Thank you.
and
really because in our religion you know that you are planning a funeral very quickly you know usually within a few days
and I have really only invited very close friends and family members
"I was more or less responsible for my father being remarried, but his widow was somehow"
"not really up to him, so I took care of it and I wish I had invited one"
I kept it very private and really just said the people after the fact
"that he would have known that if they had known, he would have liked to go to the ministry."
"about it so I really only invited because only the time pressure really only a handful of people, but"
"Now that time has passed, I wish I had invited you."
more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends
You know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and I really just...
and even distant family members that I really only told after the fact that I really didn't invite them because
"I was under time pressure, but I could have just done it by e-mail, or it's hard to call anyone personally, but"
I wish that was something because people said something.
"They were mad at me when my other family members threw everything back at me, oh you didn't tell me until after the fact that"
"You know that and so it was over, so they threw it at me because I was more or less"
"to do it, so I wish I had done it differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really"
angry at myself about something that I probably should have been better prepared for something < s something that came was inevitable so
"Well, my two parents have been here lately"
Died in the last few years
"And I had a brother whom I had three younger brothers, one of whom died."
in December
and
we are not super close as I always look at other families
We were just never so Norman Rockwell Uh Painting
"I guess we're different, too."
and uh
I have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family
"not that it's weird, but I wish it was more like a boy from one of those families that came together every Sunday and had dinner and all that"
we just
We never did that because we all
All so uh
uh different
"Yeah, it's just being, but..."
"You know strangers and most people, I just say that you know how the family everyone is great you know"
But I think every family has its own kind of
Goods
"No, but I thought I could have had it before."
some other events in my life and I was just not sure that I was going to have a therapy in the past just out
"You know, I was in the military, and I was never really sure that was exactly what it was."
but I think I'm working
"pretty good, but I wasn't sure that I had been to therapy and counseling over the years."
I didn't sign up as an officer.
I went to one of the service academies
the
I started at seventeen when I was in high school.
and I went to a service academy
"So it's more prestige it's just not, it's the hard place where I went it's the hardest school in America to get in"
I was as old as everyone else who went there.
We did it.
Eighty-three
um
just was basically nothing intense it was just we were just around some we were just
"We were not allowed to carry ammunition, we were just our position, were only shot at."
at the moment
and poison gas was sprayed on us
so
That was a
It wasn't too much.
too intense it was much you know because it was the service I was in training much more intense than any actual combat situation
"That's because they train you well, it's like practicing harder than you play, when you're an athlete, when you play football, you practice harder than you do."
You actually play in the game and the same with uh
You know if you're in the fight.
Unit
well it made me become patriotic grown up
in California
Whereas people from all over the country:
and I have to meet while most say my friends who grew up in wealthy loose angels as I did
never really went and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds and i
at the end always uh
only patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country
"while in Southern California you really don't grow up with it, while someone in texas or Kentucky or tennessee or"
georgia north dakota south dakota montana
grows up with this kind of uh
"Pride, so I thought it was good and it"
unlike so many of my friends who
You don't know there's a life between Malibu and Manhattan.
"I graduated, I was still in reserves, but I went to graduate school."
and I have two graduates
and I went to work in the private company
uh
I didn't care.
then I stepped into the fire department I was a fireman and paramedic
for a number of years; and
"then, after I got divorced, it was more difficult to deal with the custody situation with my daughter, so I went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell"
um
"At first it was because I had such an attitude in my butt, of the way I went, I spoke"
and again I was an officer
You were very regiment on the way you were dressed in your private time it was harder taking me a while
in order to be able to get back to loose narrowes
uh
Because it was just so uh
so different I think I have it better than most I have a stronger personality
"So, but..."
it was a great experience
um
it all depends on whether I do sports regularly and I don't eat too late
and things are going well in my life I generally sleep pretty well
Even though I may have to get up and go to the bathroom once a night...
but I sleep in general uh
I sleep pretty well in general
I've been feeling pretty good lately
"You know, I was like any other more periods of blue in your life, but"
Boy in the last few months I feel pretty big
"No, not really."
I seem I think I seem a little happier more content lately
"I thought maybe in the past, because I have a family history of it."
and
you know
It wasn't
everything really to weaken
and I couldn't really work
"on my own, but I was busy looking for advice"
I did I was really against it in the past
"and until after I left, I mean, I wish I was going to say more during my uh"
"my marriage over the course of my life now I think it's very useful, but in the past"
I was one of those I grew up and heard it was just ridiculous.
"and it was a waste of money etcetera, but I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it"
"Oh just a few questions I just wanted to know an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you,"
Life relations
and sometimes it's good to speak things out with a
"a professional, even if I wouldn't see someone like you in real life, I prefer someone older than I am a little more life experience than someone who might be younger"
"So, but yes, I think it's a useful tool and"
I really have a hundred and eighty-degree switch on that
"I'm not going now, I'm taking a break, but I'm not against having a few problems I want to bounce off."
I have someone I'm going to
"Yeah, that's good."
I think it's nice.
you know that she really
when you go to someone who is good and again I've been to some different people and bought some kind of therapist
"They really don't tell you what to think, what I think is great."
always in the past they just help you talk through your
Your thoughts
"and your feelings and let you decide, but bring a little clarity"
"to the situation, so I like"
To talk to someone who has much more life experience
and I'm generally more comfortable talking to a woman about this stuff than telling a man
"Well, but it's"
um
I think it's a useful tool I have some good ideas and
"was able to talk to some things from totally someone who is unbiased and not in your everyday life, instead of having a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you"
but sometimes the people of strangers hop is good
This morning.
"I know that's weird, but I'm clearly someone and I'd say that as a joke to my friends and"
Family and staff I have clearly I have a simple day today because I knew we have nice weather
and I have a number of errands to run
"and I clearly have seasonal affective disorder, but I woke up so happy today when I know it will be eighty degrees out"
"and when the weather is nice, I am usually much happier than when the weather [Laughter] is dark and blue and rainy and cold"
where I always know that the term so
but I'm just good I woke up very happy today because I knew it would be a nice day
And I was looking forward to the sun
so
Most of my friends I'm a kind of renaissance man I know a little about a lot of topics
I'm too smart for my own good.
And I'm a
I know a lot of permeable things I'm pretty rational
I'm very resourceful
People always call me when they have problems
"and I help to speak them through them, or I am resourceful and tell them where to go"
"whether it's where you buy a new computer or buy a new car, or"
"You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses."
uh
and uh
"You know, people say I'm a lot of fun, too."
I'm amusing to be with you
and
I also have I don't have many gray areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white
I am what I am
I'm not b_s
you know
I am the opposite of a politician.
"So I'm not telling people what they want to hear, I'm not rude to anyone, but I'm pretty much calling things as I see them."
So that's pretty much
"No, not really, because I do everything tactfully"
I like to think I'm doing it
uh
"I probably spent more time with my parents before they died, but I was busy"
uh
I wish I could spend more time with my daughter when she was younger.
uh
but only a lot of it is very typical
"really think things through a little more, be a little less impulsive"
or pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now
I think that's it and I'd look at things in the long run instead of looking at them.
in the short term you know when you make decisions or decisions
I'm proud of my daughter.
a nice young lady I'm uh
"proud of my public service, I've never really got a job for my money"
Military and fire service
There are very few people like me who did it.
who are
"had the background in the education I did, but I like public service"
and
So I'm proud that
proud of all the certificates I hang on my walls at home and degrees
Type of trophies
I am proud that I have been able to stay in good physical condition over the years and
Knock wood get good health
It was nice to meet you.
"Goodbye, thank you."
