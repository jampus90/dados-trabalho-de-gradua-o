Yes
I'm fine.
Uh mexico
when I was seven years old
I've been there three or four times on vacation.
"I don't know if it's because I'm on vacation, but..."
I feel more at peace there than here
"Well, my uh family moved down here for a better life uh that were my parents"
"mm just the weather and the different things you could do, you could be on the beach or you could go into the mountains to do different variety of things"
traffic and sometimes yeah basically traffic and yeah that's one of the most important things
not so much I was in New York and uh mexico just
uh just uh new places to see and find new places you know something new
as for a trip or
"Well, I was in Mexico, I was in the pyramids of..."
I forgot what it's called in Mexico City.
and I like you to know about uh find about my old culture since I'm uh uh Mexican from Mayan Aztec so I like to see different things like this
good uh at school
"Well, I got uh out, but I came back and I'm trying to get back into it now trying to learn uh graphic designs"
well I started to like you know to take photos different things and I know as you
I go into business I like what it justifies over
I want to make my own business either web pages just be able to be free
"and don't rely on anyone else, just be able to have freedom for me"
Outward
"Well, I like that you know."
to be people who like to get to know people and depend on the person how I feel about them
I like to listen to music or you know
do different things like play sports or do different things just to relax
"Well, I'm getting better at it"
you know
i xxx
"Well, it was like uh"
Two days ago it was something about uh I had to pay a bill or something < some> something that uh I know I've been around
but the person he is like more picky about it you know he's more
You know how girls are you know they want everything right there and then
I've handled it you know I've got it all there and they just annoy sometimes they don't give you the room
that you have to solve something
I felt overwhelmed I had already solved it I was just waiting for
"A check you know, it's not my control, but I've already made the right arrangements and she bugs me about it and it's like"
You imagine an argument that you know a storm in a glass of water.
It's like Mhm.
All right.
"There are some of them, but not so recently, because I'm more"
"try to get my life together, but the decisions I made in the past"
like early school leaving and other different things to do
mm
Don't blame so much because
not really
not that I could think directly of my head
the toughest decision
"Oh, it's just not on my head right now"
an event
The only things I remember are when I'm black or other things like that I don't remember.
but
not anything like a certain only when my uh brothers died and various things like this
mhm
"Well, my brother was in gangs and different things and he got more in trouble"
and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about a lot coming in
"No, I'm Hispanic, you know, I like being with my family."
"And you know I like going to Mexico, I have a half sister, and my grandpa died, he was over there in Mexico."
So I like having a good relationship with my family.
All right.
"my mom and dad they always work hard they always did what they had to do to pay the bills, that's why sometimes I'm running around as you know trying to do everything, but done properly don't try to take the easy way out"
It's a little hard because it's mostly here in Los Angeles there's a lot
different things you could get into are not so positive
and it's hard to focus on you knowing the right things to stay
"Well, usually I just knock out, it's not that hard, it's like it takes me half an hour or fifteen minutes, but..."
Sometimes I can't even wake up with the alarm.
"You need to wake me up, you know my girl needs to wake me up, even if the alarm starts."
hard so you know I just knock out
I get a little bit either I'm angry or I don't feel good and I'm not filled with energy
But I still need to know that I have to do something to keep going through it.
I was good I felt good you know
"was a little restless, but I didn't have to do that much"
All I know is you made me do it no matter how I feel.
no
nothing unusual
no
no
"the last time I felt happy that was probably on the weekend that I was you know, going with a"
Going out have some fun and you know that I was drinking and just relaxing
and winding <win>
mhm
my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either outside or at home just relax
but nothing else you know just be able to relax and relax with it you either go somewhere to a beautiful place or stay at home
but without any calls or xxx interruptions you know only to be able to turn off the phone and turn everything off just
with her to do the other different things
mhm
"uh like an outgoing guy you know very socially, but at the same time I'm reserved depending on how I feel with people"
"you need to know, build trust or feel comfortable with them"
"Oh, I'm changing a lot you know like"
uh my temper and various things drink things I am
change a little different things so I could get more different things done
"Oh, there are several, but mostly uh"
"When I come from Mexico, they want you to be different down there, it feels like silly because I went to a store where I was dressed regularly."
and I told them I wanted to buy something and then they said that
"that I don't belong there and I and as soon as they saw my credit card, they somehow changed perspective because they saw the Wells Fargo logo that they know I was American"
But they thought it was the way you know it.
"it was <wa> it made me feel ridiculous because you're going to a place and you've got the money you're asking for something, you're going to ask for something because you don't just have to waste it <wa> kill their time"
just because they saw a card logo
That's how they know you
It was just ridiculous for me
no
basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school
"And you don't know that you know you're trying to control my temper and do different things, because if I knew what I know now, it would be different."
"Well, I ran away, but I went back to school and I know I got high school."
and right now I'm in the process of doing other things so now is uh getting my high school getting that together
"and right now I'm working on another goal trying to you know that mine either go back to school, so it's basically <ba> back to school and graduating from high school of g_e_d"
mhm
All right.
You're welcome.
See you.
