value
Yes
"I'm good, thank you."
Around I was born in Mexico City
Yes
About thirty-four years ago
Yes <Laughter>
"I try to go back once a year, but I haven't been here for three years."
"I haven't had the time yet and I've traveled to other places, but I plan to probably go back next year."
"Well, I can never see me retreating to Mexico City, it's a huge city and"
I like l_a more there are more possibilities and
I feel like I'm at home here
"My family moved here, as I said, I was very young and my parents moved to California to work, and then we just stayed here."
"I love traveling, I didn't travel as much as I'd like, but I love to travel."
To see only new things that people from other countries meet...
feel relaxed and have no worries because you are on vacation
I love being easy
in other places
The last trip I made was a seven-day cruise.
and it went to Saints thomas barbados saint lucia
um
Saint Martin
"and it was amazing, I would love to do this journey again"
um
I think going to Mexico the last time I was there
I went to the pyramids teotihuacan and I had not been there in many years and it was just amazing to see
the pyramids and I can't even imagine how they were able to build such large structures
I think I'm more shy.
around in social situations I feel somehow uncomfortable
I'm not one to just
Go to the people and start talking
"When people come to me, of course, I'll talk to them, but I feel a little embarrassed."
Kind of out of place at a party
I've studied history.
I've always been interested in history.
and I just wanted to learn stories from other cultures and of course u_s history
So I'm very much in history
I actually work in education.
my dream job would actually be to travel around the world and have a show like the Travel Channel < laughter> that would be my dream job because I would be paid to travel and it's something I'd like to do
do
um
So I'd like to do this as a job
I love to read
and I love to take baths so relax I like to take a bath and I read while I'm in the bathroom
and I also like to go to the gym that helps me uh
Dealing with stress and
"It relaxes me, even if I train."
um
"I wasn't very good at controlling it when I was a kid, I would easily go crazy."
and sometimes as an adult I still get angry
"easy, but I've been much better at"
"try to think about things first before they say, and"
Without outbreaks
Things like this
"The last time I had a fight with someone, it was probably my best friend a week ago."
and she actually has children I don't have.
and for some reason she thought
or thinks that I think I'm a better person than she is and because I went to school and
she didn't do it and she's home with kids and you know I can do more things
I don't think I ever gave her the feeling that...
"I and I definitely don't know how I feel better than them, but for some reason they accused me of it and we had an argument about it."
um
"I wish I'd handled differently, because"
"when she spoke to me, she was very upset and"
"I started pretty calm, just trying to argue with her and let her know that I certainly didn't feel like I was better than her"
but towards the end of the conversation it somehow turned into a scream
match between the two of us and I wish I had been able to just stay calm and
"Maybe she asked me to call later, as soon as we calmed down, instead of just continuing the argument."
"I was angry at first, but once we hung up, I felt really bad about the situation."
I thought maybe I could have just left her.
omit all her feelings and then try to talk to her calmly
"instead of yelling at them,"
Oh wow around
"That's a tough thing, I think."
"God, I think one of the toughest decisions I had to make is the separation with a friend of seven years."
um
although I knew it was the right thing to do I was
the fact that we were together for so many years and
I felt by ending the relationship.
I would have wasted the last seven years of my life.
"it was a pretty hard decision to make, but I realized it was the best decision for me at the time and I'm really glad I did."
Because then I went on to meet myself
My husband
Thank you.
"Well, I'd say"
Maybe
Fifteen years ago I was
with a few friends on one
Association
And they met some guys and invited us to their house.
"and I really didn't want to go because I didn't know these people and I mean, I knew their names and that was it"
"but my friends really wanted to go and I wasn't the one driving, so I decided to just go with them"
and
back at her house around
one of the boys
actually pulled me into a room and
tried
I got scared I screamed
he tried to suffocate me and I thought
"I wanted to die right there, I thought he was gonna kill me."
"But luckily one of my friends knocked on the door, because she heard me scream and we went"
so
"it could have been a worse situation, but I'm still thinking about it and I wish I could erase it from my head"
It was
"We have a pretty good relationship, I'm close, I have a sister and a brother."
my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older
and we get out pretty well
"My sister and I used to be best friends, but then we grew apart and now we're actually closer than ever."
and I have a pretty good relationship with my parents
My father.
still treats me like a little child sometimes < laugh> what annoys me
but I think we have a pretty good solid relationship
"Yeah, that's good."
I usually wake up
a few times during the night
um
so
I think it's rare for me to sleep
all night long
"Um, and I feel a little bit"
"how tired in the morning, when I wake up, it's hard, I'm not a morning person definitely"
um
"So yeah, it's kind of hard to get a good night's sleep"
I don't know.
I've got a hard time falling asleep
and then sometimes I have bad dreams or
I have to get up to use the toilet.
Of course.
I don't remember the last time I actually slept all night without waking up at least once.
um
emotional good
"I'm on vacation from work right now, so that's really nice."
um
physically I feel good I haven't been in the gym for a while so somehow
gives me the feeling
bad because I like to train
"But to be healthy, I'm good <Laughter>"
no
no
um
It was
Last weekend I actually went out of town with my husband
"We didn't go very far, we went to Santa Barbara."
we really enjoyed ourselves around we went wine tasting and
went to the beach and just had a really good time
She would probably describe me as a good caring person.
um
Patients
Very shy
um
She would probably also say that I have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors because I always do things for other people.
"Well, yeah, that's how she'd describe me."
I wish I were more absent
um
I wish that
i
What else is it?
in any case more outgoing
um
so I could have more friends I don't have a large group of friends because I'm very shy
I also wish I could have more patience than I did <Laughter> sometimes I'm very close to patience
and I wish I could
Find a better job so I could do more travel
um
Yes I really have a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree
and I really wish I had
You know I took care of it a lot earlier than I did.
um
And I also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend
I would have told myself to focus on school.
Go out and hang out and just
you know
and going to parties around wasn't as important as I thought it was and that my education should always come first
I'm proud I haven't been to school for so many years.
go to u_c_l_a and get my degree
um
"yes, that would be my most proud achievement"
All right.
Thank you.
See you.
