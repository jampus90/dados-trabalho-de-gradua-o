value

Around back and forth over the years and traveled a little
They haven't been out there in over fifteen sixteen years.

uh
Miscellaneous food for
"people understand each other, as I understand it, it's a kind of culture shock."
uh
out there just based on the food they like to give you a lot of food
"This tastes really good for a little money to keep a lifelong customer, but out here they want to go up there and give you a little food for a whole lot of money, so they only make money <Laughter>"
um
The parents had a business here.
um
not heavy
I could get used to anywhere
the view and the sea
uh
Just...
a division of the people that it is <Laughter>
Just a few places
learn to see different people and learn how different people interact and interact with each other
<Laughter>um
uh
I remember a trip years ago where I went to Mexico with my brother
"Yeah, that's good."
um
Jump into a lake <Laughter> quite far from the side of a mountain <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
all
There's no subject I don't like.
um

Working with computers and helping people
This is
where my heart is I like computers and I also like to help people
I meditate to train
"I'm running, I'm running."
um
I'm writing read
Median
mm
I'd say very good.
"Oh yeah, that doesn't make it seem so good <Laughter> the last time I argued"
has been
about someone who actually spits out a racial mess
to my wife
Angry
Annoyed pain
disrespectful
and especially when I went up there to actually treat the person I treated them with dignity and respect and tried to help the person at first
it's not a problem people are people
mm
I had a chance at school to really go a lot further than I did
and I leave something very small
and without meaning stop me in the persecution of him
um
Ignorance
<laughter> due to lack of a better word
"Now that I'm thinking about it again, I could have done a lot to avoid it, but I was just young and stupid"
to live again
um
as much pain as I have seen in the world
um
a compilation of all events uh just different bad things I've seen
i
"If I could change it, I would"
sometimes
I guess things are for a reason
Even if we may not understand
um
I have no answer to that.
um
Blood family we really don't talk about
my wife
I don't know if she really wants to be with me or not
"She thinks I'm doing everything in the world, but that I'm not"
and really <Laughter>
I don't understand.
"I know my daughter loves me, but I don't know if she wants to be with me or not."
because
when someone talks to you
when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in them voice and belief in their eyes
"If you say something so often, that's what really lies in your heart."
"<sharp inhalation> so you can say whatever through your mouth, but it's what really is there"
I love my daughter
she an angel I cut her umbilical cord
I went out there and put on her first shirt.
I saw her come out.
she looked at me right out of her stomach <Laughter> she wouldn't fight with the doctors wouldn't let her touch a little bit
"I talked to her, I told her to calm down, or I told her it was Daddy that she looked at me and grabbed my fingers and how she calmed down and just let her do everything they had to do."
"No, the task is constantly changing"
"what you have to do that day won't be the same as the next day or the next one after that, it's always around"
what is a better word for it around
<Laughter>um
Adjustment
um
The most difficult thing I'll probably say
is
scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for her not xxx learn the wrong lessons
<Laughter> See your baby smile in appreciation
I'm trying to guard my baby a lot more of things she sees
um
when I was younger there were a lot of things I saw no child or adult should have seen
and
if < whe>
I've grown up
I have sworn that I will always take care of my child and
I wouldn't disappear or
Let them be near such things.
um
my old foster parents

they basically showed me no matter where you come from
They can always strive to get better
um
a good night's sleep
"Oh, um, it's coming."
the same only tired and yawning <Laughter>
how I felt
mm
For example:
I have a plethora of questions and
an abundance of gold
in my
"gripping and it's right out of my reach, because I just need the one"
Plug to really just
"to see what I'm capable of and I know I'm capable of too much, it's just"
I have to make this connection.
no
um
mm not p_t_s_d no
uh
"I said yes, but"
I don't think I'm more depressed or something than any other person who has all their different breakpoints.

something to change
I'd like to be more precise

"Stop thinking about what else happened, and just do what you have to do."
I'm positive I'm goal-oriented
Determined
