value
"Yeah, come on."
I'm fine.
I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a little and then I lived abroad for a little while then I moved to California
mhm
"I moved here at the end of June last year, so I guess it was eight months ago that there was such a thing."
To <sigh>
Most likely twice a year
"To <sigh> it's a good question, I've always wanted to live in California, but I had lived in the central coast around"
and
I had just come to l_a as once a month for various business and network and personal development things so
"Yeah, things changed."
in santa cruz for me the customer I had who was really the most important as financial
um
"Main source of finance I had that relationship ended, so I was totally free to move and I thought, well I think I'll give l_a a try and see what happens so"
So I gave it a chance and here I am
Oh not at all <Laughter> It's a very big city around
"I lived in Dublin in Ireland it was one that is also a big city, but"
"As you know, European cities are much more dense and public transport is much easier to use."
and
"Yeah, so just getting around here and getting acquainted with the city was pretty challenging and uh"
"Yeah, that's good."
so
I love to travel I love it yes I have lived in Ireland and I traveled around
I was in morocco and I was in costa rica
"I spent some time in Mexico, so..."
"Yeah, that's good."
to meet i love <sigh> new people who experience new cultures and how
"not only see what is different, but see what is similar among people everywhere you go"
"To be sure, good."
I guess...
I'm trying to think what my favorite was I mean anyway there were amazing things about Morocco and Costa rica both but
"Morocco was incredible, it was like twelve days and we went to three different places that we found in the Atlas Mountains that are beautiful and uh"
"Yeah, it's a really cool culture, so it was fun."
"um <sigh> my trip to Ireland I actually visited there, which is why I decided to move there, so"
"my most memorable moment of this trip, I mean, there are probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of this trip was"
To be on a bus and go
to dublin and go only to the country and
"see how absolutely stunningly beautiful it is I mean, it's everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you know you see it in movies and it's green and lush and beautiful, but"
"when you actually get there and experience it, it's like the pictures don't do it right, so it was incredible"
"Yeah, that's good."
um i have a degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women's studies
No I use my English and psychology to work in marketing communication so
I'm actually doing sales
"So yes, psychology definitely comes into play."
comes into play and anyway does my
"I guess my undergrade in English, but really how I accepted that and created something out of it because most people who only teach an English degree and I didn't want to teach"
um
to
I'm not quite sure about the question.
All right.
Wow around <sigh>
You know my dream job is
as a
a motivational speaker and trainer and trainer
"to travel the world, to do so and to influence people's lives, and"
To make a real contribution to people
around my relationship is pretty good actually i
I just fixed my relationship with my biological mother who
She wasn't sporadic I saw her grow up sporadic I lived my father pulled me and then he married my stepmother and
"They had two children together, so I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with, but I talked to my biological mother."
"Um, last May and we were"
We know that things have been cleared up and have been in communication ever since.
um
"Well, I don't know what moment you mean, but if you mean to be in communication with my biological mother"
um
"I mean, it was very liberating to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and anyway not only the future, but in the present moment with it so"
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm shy.
"To relax, I do a number of things that I like to do yoga, although I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance."
I love to read
I love to go into the ocean spending time just staring at the waves and soaking all these negative ions
"which really recharges my battery, probably more than anything else"
um
I like being with friends around
I love art and
Try new restaurants around
"Yeah, all these things are"
both relaxing anyway I think they relax in the sense that
I feel connected with the people in my life and with the experiences of my life so
"Yeah, that's right."
"depends on whether I'm not driving very well, but otherwise I'm pretty good at it <Laughter>"
"To <sigh> Last time I argued with someone, it should probably be"
"Oh no, it was with the l_a times about newspaper delivery"
"Yeah, that was the last time."
"Yes, the <sigh>um the newspaper that should appear for the elderly lady I care for"
It didn't show up.
and
I didn't know it was just there.
"Um, late, I don't know, afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called her and"
"They said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning, which was absurd to me when they made the mistake at all."
"So I mean for a service we pay for every day, so, um, it was really irritable and then I found out that"
"the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and had not been communicated with me, so"
I was angry at the times when I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and had not told me that I was quite frustrated.
Oh wow there are quite a lot of them around
let me think about one
"Um, I had a call the other day."
and I'm in a coaching program and
It was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program
"And she explained to me that there was an additional call that we would meet every week, and then we also have coaching calls because we have a specific trainer we work with."
and then she called to tell me that I had another coaching call with
um
Someone who's not my coach and uh that
had not been explained to me as part of the program so that at that moment it seemed to me just like oh my God I have all this
People I have to be accountable to and I'm like anyway you know I have to
"not only be accountable to them, but share private things that happen in my life with these people and it was just I don't know"
so
"Yeah, I wasn't..."
I wasn't angry I was just feeling frustrated and a little overwhelmed at this moment and
"You know, and I talked her out of it, and we've been through it, but..."
um
"Yeah, I could have done it."
sure was just okay with what was asked by me at that time and
I would have made the call much smoother.
The hardest decision there was was a few.
I guess moving to Ireland was probably the toughest decision
"No, it wasn't even the hardest decision, it was such a simple decision, but telling my family about it was"
challenging
But the hardest decision was my first time that I
Moved
uh away from my family I was twenty-eight and I decided I decided to move to Colorado
"And that was a pretty tough decision, because then my family was"
"You know, within an hour drive from wherever I lived for an hour and a half and now you'll know,"
"Around a twelve hour drive or an airplane ride away, so it was difficult"
"Oh, many things..."
I loved colorado colorado is a beautiful and beautiful condition
the weather is so much better than wisconsin and around
at the time I was very much in rock climbing
"and there is only a huge outdoor community in Colorado, so there were a lot more people who"
To be in my age group and or single that was another factor around
"and were interested in the things I was interested in, so Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit"
so
"Yes and then I found a job I liked the pay was cruel, but"
I found some work that was really rewarding and so everything came together and I decided to move
"Yeah, that's good."
That was a completely independent question about <sigh>
relatively light
It just depends on how long I go to sleep when I'm outside and I don't come home until eleven thirty
"You know, then I go to bed too late and uh I wake up on feeling tired as I feel today"
but usually I can sleep through the night I had some pretty
Fear paralyzed dreams over the last few weeks
"but even if I wake up from them or if I know I can move from them, I can still fall back relatively easily to sleep"
"Yeah, I'm sure they're I mean, I'm in another transition state from which I'm moving out"
"From the house where I live, where I take care of an elderly woman."
"Yeah, and I just need to find"
the financial means to support me and it is
and she creates a lot of fear just in her state of being she is exhausting and totally depressing
so
"Yeah, that's good."
"To live with her is pretty hard, as if it was probably the most difficult thing I've ever done, and I would never do it again if I were honest, if I knew what I was getting into, I don't think I would have said yes to the situation."
"I feel trapped and helpless, like you don't know anything I can do."
"There's no way out of the situation that I don't care what I do, it doesn't get better I don't know that I don't get any kind of work I want to do"
And my money doesn't work at all.
"So yeah, it feels pretty crappy"
<Laughter>Thank you
"I've been in the past, yes"
Oh a long time I was fifteen I think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago
I was suicidal.
"Oh, yeah, I feel like I'm down there"
I don't really know no
um
I stopped originally.
"with my therapist because we had finished, I mean, we had"
worked on what had to be worked and I was no longer depressed
and then I started the therapy again
Later
I think I was in my early thirties.
"And then we ended this because I moved to Ireland, so..."
"Yes, I mean, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention as I don't think in therapy oh I'll be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years I think that's ridiculous"
I think you're going to therapy to work on a particular problem and have a solution and someone who's your soundboard can see things you can't see.
and
"You know, work through this situation and come with..."
a strategy for
"not only that not only the creation of a solution in this area, but also the creation of strategies"
and uh tools for the rest of your life so you don't have to be in therapy forever
Deep breath the last time I felt really happy
What are you doing?
"Wow, that's pretty sad"
It's been at least a year.
"No, that's not true."
If I
saw my biological mother who was last May
my best qualities
To <sigh>
I'm very strong
very strong-willed
i um
I am very supportive and loving and caring
um
I'm just being here
I'm intelligent.
and
um
"Yeah, that's good."
everything I regret
I don't think so.
no
Don't take life too seriously
"Oh, my ideal weekend"
"I spend some time on the beach, I spend some time with friends"
"either go out in the evening in a movie, or"
I'm just going out to...
a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together
To maybe go dancing later
And on Sundays I usually go to
Scrubbed_entry
And then I got brunch with friends and
um
"Yeah, I'm going home and Sunday night I'm getting ready for the next day so"
hmm <sigh>
I'm very proud of
um
a few things I mean
I moved to places I wanted to move to.
and so I have done things that have really spoken to me and have
Meaning something you know that I loved the heart to actually do it.
um

Objectives or objectives
