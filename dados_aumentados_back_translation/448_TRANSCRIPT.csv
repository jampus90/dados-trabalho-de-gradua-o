<sync>
Yes
Pretty well done
oh I was born in uh brooklyn new york I came out here when I was seven
and I've been here since I was no more than a
Californian <Laughter>
I'm a welder
um
I just...
I don't know anything about it.
It does and builds things and repairs things that
fascinated me and
"Uh uh I was actually pretty good at it, so I stuck to it and that's my job"
I never had what I just had.
uh <sigh> somehow always uh hoped that I would have a job that could support me and my family and uh
I was satisfied with it
I just lost my uncle and he raised me since I was seven years old.
and uh
"Except for my wife, I don't have a family anymore."
"Um, he died last July."
And I'm
I'm starting to get over it.
"I knew the day would come, but he was my last living relative."
I was depressed about it and uh
But I'm better.
it depends on the atmosphere around
"When I'm with people I don't feel well with,"
Type and manner reserved
But...
when I feel comfortable
and uh
I feel like I'm fit in good I'm starting out
< slaughter>
< slaughter>
Right
I enjoy old movies uh old uh good it's movie noir and uh I love these old black and white movies and I get on netflix or amazon and
I'm trying to choose a movie that's uh
"from then on, people were different from them"
I don't know it's just another era and I enjoy it
"- Yeah, that's good."
"my wife uh I probably don't say as well as I think I do, but"
"I have to admit, sometimes I lose my temper."
and it's after her about things I shouldn't lose my temper about
But...
I'm working on it and
uh
I've had this problem since I was a little kid.
"Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,"
I was in trouble with the law when I was a lot younger.
"You know, when you're young, you think you know everything and you know you'll never get old and the future doesn't matter."
But it matters because everything you do when you're young.
uh follows you for the rest of your life and
"I don't regret things I've done, but if I could go back, I would definitely make different decisions."
Uh me and my wife we
we do not argue that we do not agree
and it's
"She's very strong-willed and she's a game for me, so we go back and forth, but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh"
Uh say mean things or hurt each other we're just her is
"a determined, willful woman and <sniff>"
I'm who I am so
we go back and forth and
"lately, I've been the one to <sigh>"
Bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long term
"It's just her and me, and there's no one more important to me."
"When I was younger, I wish I wasn't following the people I was following."
And what I mean by that is that you know that you're running in a circle with certain people and
"with an ego greater than my common sense, and"
That got me in trouble <sniff> I was a single child and uh
I enjoyed being the center of attention and
"always the girls laugh or people think I was cool or whatever you wouldn't think I'm kind of overweight and bald now, but"
"when I was in my twenties, I was a completely different person and"
<sniff>
"If I had had a few brothers and sisters, I might not have thought or acted like that, but I was a single child."
i
You know where he went.
People thought I was cool and that got me in trouble
The hardest decision I've ever had to make was
has granted approval;
um
"let my uncle die, he was on life support and his kidneys had failed"
< sigh> and around
Doctors said he couldn't do anything and didn't have him.
<sigh> goes through every suffering
to
Let him slide.
"And as you can see, I get very angry with my uncle"
"raised me as his own son, and"
Don't ever let me down
And he's gone and
"because of lack of a better word to push the button, I never thought I had to do that <sniff>"
"But like I said, I'll get over it and..."
things are getting better
my wife is always there for me <sniff> she'll always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than myself

uh uh do simple things
"It's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to, but we're going to have mesh around < sniff> we enjoy each other's company"
We like the same things and we
"You know, occasionally go and do something together, but we"
< clears throat> We just enjoy the company of the other and they
"as I say, know me better than anyone and it surprises me sometimes"
mhm
you know
<Sigh>
lately
"Well, I can't say lately < sniff> if I don't < coughs> excuse me if I don't do"
a strict activity or something that
really uh emphasizes me or straines my body
say it for a few days I'm just very relaxed and you don't know much to do
I get up automatically after four and a half five hours.
"I mean, and you know my wife's gonna say you know the guy you're not sleeping, but"
"I mean, I don't feel tired I don't feel exhausted I don't feel like I have to sleep again"
I stay up all day and
"I'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep, but"
You know for me that it's me.
It doesn't affect me.
"Well, I wish some things could be different, but I'm not dissatisfied about"
"I'm happy with my life there, like with everyone else, there are a few things I wish I could be different and I think that's in everyone that everyone else knows."
but around <sniff>
I'm I'm I'm I'm happy
"Yes, I feel a little less motivated <sniff> around"
recently good I can not say recently this was back in January
um
my wife and a couple of uh friends were
I noticed that I...
always forgetful and I couldn't remember anything
I didn't see it and...
"You know, when they all brought it to my attention,"
"But still, I went to the doctor and..."
they gave me the tests
"and apparently I have m_c_i, which is a mild cognitive impairment and uh"
I've been
over the last month or so
"No one told me, I mean, maybe I'm getting better, but"
The neurologist I saw makes me come back in a year and will test me again.
"hopefully it's not the beginning of alzheimer's I'm still a little young for that I'm only fifty < fif> fifty two, but"
I was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh
It could have been that I was told about him.
uh
"because of the death of my uncle I could have been quite depressed, I was not able to keep things and"
"All right, I'll go back in a year, and we'll see if I'm feeling better."
I'm sorry.
"I don't understand you, I'm sorry."
How <h
No no I didn't have
Yes
Two thousand one
um
I was
in a...
what is the word I'm looking for <sniff>
I was in a...
in a state of mind where I can only get in trouble and benefit from it if I did not seek help
around me was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder
uh worrying and thinking too much about things and
I think the worst and uh
I'm taking medication for it.
"Well, you know, it's not really therapy."
You know every few months you have to go to the doctor.
Do everything well and know that they only replenish your recipe <Laughter>
"It's, you know it, it's, you know it, like the next person, the next person, it's, I'm with Emperor so"
"They'll talk to you, but they'll give you the impression that"
um
"You know I'm okay, let's keep driving and know they'll hear your explanation, but"
you know
"it they didn't have all the time for you that you can wish for, so i i i i am good now if i really needed help I would"
I would do something that would work for me.
<Sigh>
the last time I felt really happy
"Well, it would depend on what the event is, I'm always happy to do something with me and my wife and we enjoy each other and I know I'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and I have nothing else, she's my world, but..."
I enjoy being with her and we're doing things together and I'm happy all the time when we do it around
when I'm outside this circle
"I don't know if that sounds right, but I'm not looking for luck, I can only explain it because I'm satisfied."
I'm not
um
"I'm not disappointed or I don't want anything, I'm you know what's coming my way is okay so"
"Well, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
I don't know that I couldn't give you that answer <Laughter> around <sniff>
"Well, my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff>"
She would...
Describe me as uh
I don't think until I speak
um i um
Leave the smallest insignificant things
annoy me and I get angry over
But the big things it's like
I let it go and she's confused by this <Coughs>
Uh <vocal fry> years and years ago
um
she I had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten in a little Fender Bender
"And she thought it would be the end of the world, because that was my baby."
and i <sigh>
"You know, hey don't worry, we're gonna fix it and she was thinking"
"<Laughter> that I wanted to hang her up or something you know because that was mine, that was that you know that was my baby."
"And she's leaving, you know her"
"You'll be excited about nothing, but you know I'll destroy something like your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money"
"You know it crashed, and you don't care."
so
That's the only way to explain it.
"Well, I need to lose some weight as you can see <Laughter> I'm definitely on a meal binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably on the occasion with my uncle"
um
"I'm heavy, I'm the hardest I've ever had in my life."
and I find it a little more difficult
"I can't say harder, but I find the willpower"
"To say no and stay and train, or"
You don't know that you're going to move now maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were
a little younger we loved going for walks < clears throat> and we lived in a
Scrubbed_entry
"Boy, look at this miracle, what's in there, you know it's not like that anymore."
I guess we're a little older now and
<Laughter> a little harder it's harder to go with all this weight <Laughter> but I wish I could change that because uh
I know it's just not healthy in size <sigh>
<sigh> uh lately
"No, I haven't regretted anything lately."
"everything was all right, the"
"as I say, the"
the largest
greatest influence in my life was the event with my uncle and uh I never
in a hundred years or ever thought that I would
Face that
"Situation and < sniff> I'll never forget it, but"
they say time heals all wounds and it does < laughter>
Don't listen to other people.
uh
"again I'm not trying to raise my uncle just because of what happened, but he used to tell me all the time, uh"
he would see the things I did and the paths I went down and I kept thinking I knew better and I think many teenagers think that anyway they
"The young lady I talked to here thinks,"
They're invincible and I thought I'd never have these problems.
um
I wish I could have changed a few things.
"The story of my past follows me, as everyone does."
and that has limited me on many occasions and many things I am able to do
"I don't miss her, but"
"If I could go back ten or twenty years, I definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions I've made."
my welding certificates around I am uh certified by the American welding company and I have uh < sniff>
"This is probably the greatest achievement I've made for you, I know myself as a performance from around < clears throal>"
People I know say I'm uh
"Well, I haven't been working on cars lately, but they said I was a natural crack for uh"
"Restoration and work on vehicles and I don't see it, but"
I was told that
"once or twice, but I kind of did"
"I kind of started slipping away, I can't say it's because of lack of interest, but"
I just don't feel the motivation anymore
"I wish I had a bag of money and I had someone else to do it, so I feel <Laughter>"
All right.
Thank you.
See you.
