safe
I'll be all right. How are you?
"Manufacture from materials of any heading, except those of the same heading as the product"
"Yeah, that's good."
About twenty-five years ago
"Yeah, it's been a while."
"Actually, I'm not back yet <Laughter> I like l_a"
I like l_a
"mm it's a big city, so it's kind of similar, but the weather isn't the same, so l_a must love for the weather"
Family I was a child
"it took a little adjustment, but not hard"
around the weather
um
"I can't imagine anything from the bat, but I wouldn't want to go, so my family is here, so that's another reason I don't want to go."
Transport < slaughter>
"not really, but I've traveled a little yeah"
new places see different people how they live their lives
I used to be at monterey California.
"last <la> or middle of last year, that was very nice"
um
That's a good question.
I'm not sure.
There are probably
"I can't think of anything from the bat that makes me think it's kind of weird, but <Laughter>"
Astronomy
"Yeah, that's it."
<tisk> I don't know that just somehow fell into it took a course it liked and then took something more and somehow just walked down the road
no
There's not much work to do.
It's kind of limited.
"Yes, it does <Laughter>"
My dream job
I'd like to own
a restaurant
a nice restaurant in the bar
"Well, I'd like something a little higher than"
most places you go to
"or at least in the area I live in most places, don't seem very somehow just like a dive bar just somehow"
worn run down so
"something beautiful, something different, something creative"
"something pulsating for you know, pulls a lot"
"but it's probably expensive, so I don't know if it's really plausible"
I'm definitely shyer
"but I can go if I'm comfortable with people, but"
At first I'm pretty shy
Good idea
To a lot of times i
"try, just"
Lie back and you know you're breathing deeply.
just somehow purify your mind
or maybe you just see a movie listening to music is good reading a book
That's what just takes your head off
Relax
"I got much better at it <Laughter> I had problems with it when I was younger, but I'm good I'm good at it now"
I learned you shouldn't.
respond immediately to situations you should
"You know, think before you talk about this kind of thing"
"My ex-girlfriend, when we broke up three months ago."
um
"We're relationship was just not very good, so it just went a predictable way and we were just arguing about the same old stuff and"
"it wasn't really a memorable argument, but it was an argument, so that's all I can think about and I haven't really seen it since"
"I don't know that it's nothing special, just a typical argument between two people who had been separated"
Frustrated
For example:
"Yeah, I guess,"
Everyone sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and I'm sure their way was right so try to convince someone that
you know
of your ideas or what you think is more difficult than it is because everyone is looking out for themselves somehow.
<tisk> but yes
mm that's a good example right there with the girlfriend that I couldn't have reacted a little different and didn't show so much emotion
There were times in my life when I had a fight with friends or something you know.
"or earlier relationships where I probably shouldn't have reacted as I knew I wasn't doing anything bad, but just more of uh"
"you know that you are more mature about it and don't know that you reveal your feelings so much, or"
this kind of thing
"leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when I was eighteen, that was a long time ago"
I went to school in San Diego and I
immediately wanted to come back so
"I ruined our relationship, and we're still friends, and I wish I hadn't."
mm
I feel that I can contribute more to my family and friends
"I think I could do better, I think I'm selling myself so short"
"Job opportunities are hard to get, but if I could find a good job, I would be much happier because I could take care of myself and others"
so don't be such a burden for the people around me
It's good.
It's very good.
We're pretty open and I see my mom and dad and my sister pretty often
"It's a good relationship, I mean, we get along well."
"I could mean it's not perfect, but it's good"
<tisk> pretty easy I'm a good sleeper
around probably irritable there
It's harder to do tasks
It's kind of like you're feeling weird or something because you don't have that much energy and
Good
relatively good
Spring time always makes everyone feel comfortable
"No, not at all."
Never
"I really mean, we feel happy every day, but it's probably been a while."
around probably like superbowl Sunday I was with all my friends we had a good time so it's probably like a month and a half or so when I was really happy
I wish I were more
I guess...
firmly committed to my goals and I wish I would have driven better to be successful I don't know that I usually settle for less
so
I don't know.
I guess that's...
the quiet behavior part of me that is good and bad <Laughter>
"Anyway, I'm alive right now, and then you realize that five ten years have passed and you should have done something."
I'll just stick with it.
Fighting with my girlfriend <Laughter> Three months ago she felt pretty bad about me <Laughter>
um
i
I don't know when I was.
"When I was in high school, I got into a fight with a friend and"
I drove.
my car too fast and it was an area I didn't know and I hit a turn I didn't know that coming and I crashed my car so I wish I didn't do that
but
"that was a long time ago, so it's not a big deal now <Laughter>"
Stupid <Laughter> immature <Laughter>
<tisk>to my parents some of my close friends I have a good group of three or four friends
These were positive influences.
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm a caring guy.
nice person good heart
a little
a little unmotivated must improve on certain aspects of his life
make yourself better and
passionately I appreciate passionately in a good and bad way < laughter>
"Well, I take care of myself very much and at the same time"
Sometimes it gets the best of me
mm
Sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or something
You do more than
they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated
So that's an example.
"Yeah, probably, but I can't think of anything out of my head."

Multitasking
and
Scrubbed_entry
mm
I don't know.
"really enjoyed I mean I do things every day I enjoy, but really enjoyed I don't know, I don't know"
"I cleaned some things out of my room, so it was nice to spill an old garbage so that it was okay, but I don't know if I really enjoyed it, but"
I felt satisfied after it
mm
"I think I could do better, I feel like an underachiever, so not much I don't know"
I am organized very detailed
I like to finish tasks
It's very important to me that you know I'm very caring.
"I have good intentions in mind, I don't like to falsify people, I don't like to lie, because once you lie, one lie leads to another, so I don't like it."
"But yes, that's"
That's it.
<Laughter> cool
Have a good day.
