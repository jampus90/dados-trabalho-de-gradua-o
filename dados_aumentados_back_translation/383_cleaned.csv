I'm doing pretty good hanging out of nice weather around I just had a recent change of feeling right now looking at you < laughter> the digital you that I say uh I don't know it's yes it's funny
um <tisk> because I always thought that uh the transmission of emotions or feelings uh

I think you see what I mean <Laughter> I'm born from around and grew up in los narrowes venice area mar vista specifically around
That's where I came from.
"Uh, good."
"There's a lot more I don't like, but what I like is"
that the public transport comes uh
that the idea of
sure you know medical drugs like marijuana is a widely used you know topic very
thought of and I feel
The deep culture of los angeles is why I stay here and pursue my art because there is a lot to do.
there is a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand < laughter> yeah

You know a lot about

It's just more like I enjoy not being
trapped in the city with all these
made ties and restrictions I enjoy
"travel, because"
I get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux picture
You know that man made a picture that he's here.
so I love traveling because I get out of this and see the world as it is
Thank you.
Would you
<Laughter> okay <Laughter>um
"Well, I..."
A type of recent last year went to
los banos Central California Region
"And although it wasn't so far from l_a, it was completely different energy around there were no phones"
there was no wifi there is no t_v
There was...
there was the mind there was a relative mind
in the sense that:
People were not diluted and get all this input from digital media and
outer influence people were just raw real and walking and chilling I worked in a hot spring resort
and I just got to breathe and walk
and farm and do a lot of carpentry
"Yeah, that's good."
"not hard, you don't even think of trouble when you do things you really love and enjoy, so it wasn't"
um
"I guess what I described about the city, I just wanted to..."
Get out of here and
Type of
Kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real deal yeah
"Uh, good."
at the moment I'm studying
"Currently I'm studying physiotherapy I'm about to become a licensed massage therapist, but before that yeah kind of cool, but before that I was too"
Scrubbed_entry
"To for music composition, so I wrote only scores for"
Films Animations Dance productions Theatre productions
Things like that yes it was cool it was funny trippy
"very trippy, but it was cool, but I had to leave this because"
Study migrations

"is not the deal not trying,"
Fall me with these chains of federal loans
So yes.

"The nightmare they put in my dream is to ease the nightmare that is my dream,"
stimulate dream back in
the modern human world
and with you know physiotherapy and artistic expression
I've got a few.
great ideas <Laughter> yeah
um
I think I'm going out more just like I just experience things so outgoing yeah
<Laughter> I thought that was really funny about what I do to relax is uh
just breath it cool off maybe a smoothie or some tea and I go cycling write yes
hmm
"pretty good, I guess I didn't"
Screaming in a long time
um
"Well, it wasn't argue that I didn't really argue much I just like to say my opinion"
and have been understood and I like the person I talk to to to say their
"Opinion and have understood it, so the last time that had happened"
"I guess yesterday I cooled down in downtown with a friend from New York and we talked about writing and basically we weren't arguing, but talking about opinions and that sometimes"
Things are not ready to be written
"Yeah, so yesterday."
hm
Guilty
"that's hard, I didn't have that feeling in a long time guilt"
What about you feeling guilty?
All right.
mm
"I don't really wish I could erase everything from my memory, because then it would just"
be like
I would feel that something was missing from my present life if
something just deleted you know butterfly effect somehow yes
hmm
"Um, maybe the time"
Scrubbed_entry
"She wanted to go to school, I took the year off and I was just"
We had an apartment with another friend.
and it has not surrendered
you don't know all
"Nothing turns out as it is thought, and that's kind of the nice thing about it, but this one turned out to be a little bit"
uh a little different actually quite different than I thought it was and
"I thought it was funny, but yes, it ended with me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended."
"Yeah, if we split up, but that's something I want."
Maybe I've been a little more thoughtful
the toughest decision
What are you doing?
"hm maybe not the most difficult, but a hard decision I had to make was leaving school my uh continuation of achieving a b_f_a"
"Yeah, that could have been the hardest."
um
It's just... I don't know.
"I mean, of course, money money is the motto money is a great theme tutorial walks around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support < s> no fan of support that"
But...
"Yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons I don't support these crazy Tution hikes and..."
but another reason why i
"decided to leave, I had to make a hard decision to decide was to leave"
also because to Art Institute you know about this is a
this is a funny idea in itself and basically I was a musician
to be taught by a musician
to
Making music
and the same with you all know the dancers or the theater students you know learn dance to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know
And it's just...
"Yeah, it's just not"
as artistic as I thought
Art would be art <shh> Art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not from out there you know so yeah
hm
if i
If I
"It's kind of easy, I mean, it depends on you knowing if I remember doing some chamomile tea or if I..."
remember to breathe and go through my mantras or
"Remember to do my pre like dream therapy work, then I can get into it really nice to"
but if I only blinded with all my thoughts then it takes a long time until I remember to breathe yeah
"To basically just breathe what I said or you know if I'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if I know the lucky chance, uh meditated by you, a nice"
a nice indica around then you really know that indica put me down pretty nice
"pretty sleepy, so a lot of things breathe you know mm you know medicinal herbs uh"
like chamomile and cannabis and
Just relieve me of bad bad juju <Laughter>
mm
I don't guess if I don't think of anything.
I felt
"Kind of like this kind of just cruise on one on a gray line, but it's a beautiful gray it's a really nice shade"
"Some people wouldn't like it, but I really like it and it's uh"
It's stable.
"Yeah, it's comfortable, yeah."
"No, I didn't."
"not from a certified doctor, no, but no, I have not <Laughter>"
um
"Yeah, I mean, I just think like the whole"
"You know, like you said, p_t_s_d depression and you know others you know mental instability, I think"
Everyone is depressed I think everyone is overjoyed I think everyone is angry
"I think everyone is shy, everyone is socially all at the same time you know it's just"
different days different You know variants different swimmers different boats You know different
Waves different waves around so yeah I think
"I'm depressed I think I'm really happy I think I'm really angry I think I'm really friendly You know everything, but only on different variants different swimmers"
Really Happy
um
"I mean, I feel very happy."
"Uh and I feel very sad, but really happy was uh I guess"
"Maybe this morning, if I just ride here just enjoy the sun enjoying the breeze"
Cycling
"Yes, it's <Laughter>"
"Well, I have a lot of best friends and they all describe me quite differently, but based on this same idea"
"That maybe I'm just getting to the point, just some kind of Aquarius, I guess."
"Well, I'm twenty-one, so twenty years ago <Laughter> I would have told myself to stay a baby uh young"
"And don't lose sight, you know, don't stop listening, let things happen again and again, don't let them happen"
be
To be a beautiful baby that I would have told myself or yes to be a beautiful baby
mm
um
"Well, I guess recently what was shown to me uh by me"
is to work my ability
with others and I speak mainly from an artistic point of view with which I have worked a lot.
Artists working on many different mediums mixed media projects and
I am very well with it and with other peoples and melts of our ideas together
"Yeah, that's good."
mm
That's a strange question like
um
Like that's gonna get me to lure me out.
"who know a moment that I remember today and think about it as if it were a past glory that I cannot fulfill today, so I think the most proud moment of my life is hanging with you right now"
"Yes, thank you very much."
