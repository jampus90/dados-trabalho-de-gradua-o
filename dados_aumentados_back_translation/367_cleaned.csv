value
Yes
I'm fine.
I'm a little bit
thoughtful I guess a little
"Uh down, but"
more or less okay
I was born in annapolis maryland
on the east coast
I originally moved because I went to film school.
and then I decided to come I moved to Washton d_c to do some work and now I'm back here again
"It's quite different to be from the east coast, it just has a different feeling than it..."
but alive
l_a is very has a very different kind of
um
"Attitude I think, and so it's a little difficult, but I"
But I've gotten more used to it since I got here.
"Uh, not at all..."
"When I left things, things were kind of"
"I lost my job out there, so I had to move out of here quickly to..."
To be together
a few people who wanted to help me and I'm just kind of
"I don't know if alienated is the right word, but I'm just kind of"
not really talk to my family or old friends who often
"It's not easy, it's"
It's kind of...
I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job
I miss some friends.
"I miss a lot of relationships I had out there, so it's difficult, I mean, it weighs a lot on my mind"
I feel like I've failed.
"and now I'm here and I don't seem to get back on my feet, so it's hard"
"Depends on the situation, I think I'm going out when I feel comfortable."
"And then I'm out extremely, but when I'm in a situation, I don't feel comfortable with me tending to be much shyer"
"so that doesn't really answer your question, but"
"Um, um..."
"I'm sure,"
I do a lot of writing
"I'm sure,"
"Music I hear, how I write and when I can"
if I really can get into that and somehow can turn off the rest of the world around the music and the thoughts somehow
It's really happening...
it can calm me it's like it's when I feel the most relaxed I think
um
"A few weeks ago, I guess I was working on a book about one about a novel."
and when I was real
When I really wrote it and...
it really worked for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was reaching something and I felt really relaxed
um
It was about a
Guy who's looking for
something it is
"It's his last day on Earth, and so he'll find a person he'll be looking for."
that he or she:
and only
was so impressed that he had to find her and spend the last minutes he had with her on Earth just because
It's kind of romantic.
Adventure Comedy kind of thing
"Well, I always did I was always a writer part of the reason why I came to l_a was because of writing the script"
So I wrote some scripts and uh
"You know, had a little success with that out here and but since then I've been kind of tired of the boundaries of the script and I've started to write more short stories and and longer"
only creative writing so
"I wanted to write a novel, but I was just waiting for the idea"
to really beat me
It's not just the [breathing out]
"parts parts, if it is good, it is really good, but it is sometimes a real fight for"
I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I love it when I just love it absolutely but sometimes i
Hate it because it's so difficult
um
but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good
good I have not I have not really a temperament i
"It's not I mean most of my anger I have is directed inward, unlike outwards to other people"
If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can
"lose, but I probably < try> that's probably just happening to me three four times in my whole life I mean in general I mean pretty much"
Try it when I'm angry
I'm not getting mad with myself with other people
um
last night I guess well <weh>um
I was arguing about whether or not.
Cleaning of vegetables was necessary because
I forget it but it was good no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay
so it became this
great argument and we have Google searches to find out who was right and who was wrong and i
"I was wrong about this one at the end, but"
It's
"Yeah, it wasn't, it was an exploding argument, but it was a definite argument."
um
uh
So much...
uh
i
i
I was in a relationship that I really
um
that I really wanted to work
and
uh
I landed and it was partly on
I wasn't on I wasn't on the right medication and so I went
like everything that was torn out of a spiral.
"Control and I feel really guilty about the way that ended and I mean, I wasn't"
"I wasn't mean, but I was"
But I got messed up more and more
and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I really feel guilty about not doing enough and not
And you know she has to tell me she never wanted to see me again.
so
"that was nice, that was pretty hard"
"Well, some of it was that"
"I was not properly meditated, I mean, now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that"
"I mean, I'm still getting"
"I'm still getting upset and getting depressed, but it's not like it's not"
I don't lose it all for days at once
um
so
"I mean, I know there's a part of me that logically knows that it wasn't all my fault, and that if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain, then I would probably have been different if I was who I am now."
I would have done it if I were.
I'd be
"it would probably have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have been, but I mean, I could"
I don't know if I could have done anything else.
Things as they were
"I mean, it's"
it's possible uh
I mean obviously
"Yeah, because I mean, that's what I'm doing."
"I mean, I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until"
"Until it makes me crazy, I stay on things"
um
and it's like every little detail that comes
I suddenly remember and it can just throw me away for a whole day I still mean
I'm still getting
I'm still getting really uncomfortable and barricaded and then ashamed of things I did in high school
"that was years ago and years ago I shouldn't even think about it because it's in the past, but I still get the feeling that I'm right there"
"Well, it's not"
just I've been trying to figure out how to deal with it I mean with him for a long time through
"by drinking and you know, just try to slow down my mind this way"
"But since the medications it's better, it wasn't impossible to deal with, it wasn't easy, but it's, but it's been better"
"Like I said, I'm doing a lot"
Do you know when I write or when I do something like I almost have to do it?
Do two things at once to completely occupy my brain
"When I see t_v, I have to play a game on my phone when I use the computer, I have to be."
"You know, a t_v show or a movie about you know, in another window, so I just"
Keep my mind busy during all this
um
"I just need, I mean,"
"I wish I could just let the thoughts come and deal with them, but I just can't yet"
They're triggered by everything.
pretty much everything I see when I
if i
"When I hear someone with a Dutch last name, when I hear someone talking about Wisconsin, when I hear that you know people are talking about it."
only
"Everything you know, I can get back and connect"
to
to this it is really it is really
"I don't know that this is the thing I mean, I never get a break"
from him
"Yeah, that's good."
um
"I don't know that I'm a very light sleeper, so I..."
awake and sleep and awake and sleep <asl> I have no problem sleeping again but I generally
You know you don't know.
I don't know that I never really needed much sleep.
it's just recently that I've really started to like the effects of not feeling enough sleep
as I would usually stay up to two or three in the morning so I could just be so exhausted that I could just wake up the next day and feel good going to work
"But now it's like I can't, that I still can't get enough sleep, I don't think I'm still sleeping very easily."
"You know, I get up and turn around all night."
You know it and now
It's just
It's
"Yeah, I'm not sleeping too well now."
um
pretty I mean
"I don't know, it's hard, it's hard to know"
I usually just some kind of power through them and just
"I'm how I am now, I just feel"
bad
um
I think
about three three four years ago
um
It was when I
I had given to take things for fear for
for
"Years before, but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you really did."
This
Situation and we need you to work on the medications you are not you need to like on these new medications that actually start
even you and heal yourself a little bit of all this
"so yes, that was kind of a turning point, but unfortunately"
It happened after everything went wrong.
I don't know.
"the moment I don't know that I don't really think I thought about it, too much then, but looking back at it, I feel"
It really makes me
angry it makes me really you know where I am right now it makes me really angry that I am
that I had to lose everything because
for
Chemicals in my brain for things I couldn't control
"And that you know that the people who were supposed to help me didn't help me, I mean, I paid, I paid a lot of money to go to doctors, and they did, and they knew it wasn't."
"It didn't help, it didn't work until"
Until
"You know, I found someone who worked and I'm just yes, so I'm like thank you guys for the help, but"
it was a little bit late now
um
There was really no choice I had to be I was I was a mess I was
It was either
I was meditating myself it influenced my work I mean it was all just at a point where I really realized that I meant I just had to do this differently
"but again it was too late because you know, then my review came a few months later and you know, after"
"after all, after having institutionalized one or two times and all the stuff you know they just decided that I just didn't worth it so they let me go"
but it was at least
that and not
Fires me
"but yes, but that's how I got help, but it was"
but it wasn't early enough
uh not
not as much as I should
um
I'm going to a couple
Meetings
I'm going to a_a so that I
To know you also keep control of this aspect <t> and there is one aspect of therapy that
"Unfortunately, you know you're unemployed."
My unemployment ran out of you know I'm you know I'm my meds from the city l_a so
"You know, I'm not really able to see money"
"Someone, so I have a psychiatrist I see, but it's really"
Very
I only saw her three times last year.
It's basically to let my medications come
And then there's you <Laughter>
Right
"Like I said, I mean"
"just the speech <tah> I mean, the ones we just take the a_a for example, because that's probably the next <cloth> closest for what I see with the therapy for now"
Just to say what's silent is just...
how to get this stuff out
try to figure out how to make this mess in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and phrases that make sense
with which you can actually deal
is a big step like
regardless of who:
"You tell me if it's a therapist or just a room full of drunks, you know, I mean, you take all this"
"Things that really killed you, and you make it something that you can handle something that you can write down what you can do."
talk about in contrast to just let it sit there only as this formless thing
"Yeah, that's good."
um
You know better than me when I was.
It's kind of
it goes <g> it has its ups and downs
I'm applying for a job.
five six jobs
or more a day you know and never get an answer that never gets an interview
never get any closer
to be self sufficient again
um
"It's hard, but that's like real world problems I feel, how the chemical parts get under control, how the depression gets under control"
"So now it's just I have to deal with the real life, that's"
it just has its own it's just its own challenge
"Yeah, that's good."
um
it was probably you know a few years ago
um
I was
I mean the thing that comes to mind right away
uh
is
everything went well at my job I made these great videos with this person I had a relationship with and we were really close
we had fun together
and we went out and got a Christmas tree
and
We spent all the time choosing the perfect Christmas tree and it was just
Feeling like a part of someone's life
and feel like part of the larger
The Greater Life
That's the one out there that you know how normal people feel
You know for this moment that I felt like
a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl he really liked and
You know everything went well and
"I mean, it didn't go really well because it was all messed up, but for that moment I felt like a normal person"
a normal happy person
and
Part of what makes it so difficult now is to know that
I don't know if I'll ever feel that again.
so
um
probably the
This is likely to be the
Education <educary> Education series I got uh
a pedagogical
uh video series I did for the National Science Foundation
um
It was
"it was really hard and it was, but in the end it became really good and"
"You know, I hope it helps a lot of kids, and it helps the world get kids excited about science, and..."
"and about the world around it, so I felt that this was a real contribution I made to"
the world
"Oh, it was part of you that it was part of my job."
It was a
we tried to come with
with new ideas uh
because we'd be together videos and things you know
"to schools and everything and they had done before, but we decided to do something really big"
"You know, and there were a lot of trips, and there were a lot of trips around"
and there was a lot to him and so
it was probably the biggest
Project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just produced it somehow
"right, that doesn't yeah"
um
I guess...
I don't know <Laughter> uh
"I don't know, it's been a while since I've really been thinking that I don't know, would I go somewhere I"
I don't know.
Thank you.
