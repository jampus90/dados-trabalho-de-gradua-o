value
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm fine.
Burbank California
"Yeah, that's good."
the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather
um
It's not too
City like Chicago or New York
It's big enough that we have beaches that we haven't locked.
sometimes the smog
Transport
"the fact that I was just here, like my whole life almost"
not enough because I'd like to go to school in Chicago.
and I've been to New York a few times
San Francisco and I made a road trip through the country
That was cool I saw a few states
see new places
um
go to places of interest that I only have
over or seen images of
um
I traveled from los angeles to chicago under Route sixty-six
and the best part was to see the Grand Canyon for the first time
It was
"the coolest thing I've ever seen, probably <Laughter>"
Happy
and then it was just happy it was nice it was nice
I haven't felt that way in a long time.
I studied film.
It's just
something I've always loved as long as I can remember and when it came time to start
I wasn't sure what I was going to do.
and
I applied to the northwest as a film student
and it just ended up as the right decision
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,"
um
I love making movies
But part of me really loves
Make people laugh and stand in front of the camera
so
uh
"Comedian a comedian <comie> <laughter> Comedian actor would be awesome, but"
That's hard <Laughter>
I'm super exiting
"and I love talking to people, I like to be the center of attention usually <Laughter>"
i um
I like watching mindless TV
How to
Small children in Tiaras and around
Entendynastie only t_v programs where I really don't have to pay attention to all
I'm fine.
i
Really Getting
"emotional really fast, but I'm usually"
be able to:
to keep my anger down and not like eyelashes on others and so on
for the most part
sometimes
I get in like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are really easy to care about
And I hate to apologize to people so the fights can take quite a long time
um
My best friend <Laughter> Ryan I think
and it was about
our relationship and only
how we kind of messed it up and crossed some boundaries and
How about we get back to the way it was before?
really hard
It's...
He's my best friend and I miss him.
but
"We screwed it up, and it's just not the same thing."
It's not like the same friendship <Laughter>
Me too <Laughter>
<Laughter>
I guess...
Scrubbed_entry
When I had a boyfriend and he had a girlfriend
which was not okay
I wish I had just
realized that this was bad
"and would have just stopped there and not let it go on for weeks, which has led to my separation."
And then our friendship gets really messed up
I don't appreciate spending as much time with him as I did
be more confident
um
I guess...
It was
November
I was very depressed and suicidal
So I told my friend.
what I felt
and that she had to take me to the e_r
"and from the e_r I had the choice,"
"I don't know, I guess I'm going home or being sent to a psychiatric clinic."
"and even though I felt that I had no choice, I knew it was my choice and I"
decided to go to the psychiatric clinic that was like the worst experience of my life ever
um
[exhale] It was terrible
It was in Chicago and around
It was scary.
"I mean, I didn't know anybody, and they like all your stuff, and they put you in some scrubs, and they just..."
"start giving you medication and you are basically left to your own devices, there were only three group therapy sessions a day and everyone was there"
Mostly men and... they were all really old.
and
"It was scary that I didn't know anyone most people there were not depressed, they were violent <Laughter>"
"So that was pretty scary, and I..."
It was really hard for me <Laughter>
"I was as depressed for as a month, I stopped going to my classes and working and I told my teachers lies"
about being sick and I just called sick to work
I dropped a class and I failed my classes and didn't turn in any work and
I haven't spoken to any of my friends and
I was
Drink much and faint and vomiting everywhere and
I was just in a really bad place.
"And when I finally tried to kill myself, I realized I needed help."
It was
um
I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager
And then I tried to kill myself
and I was put into therapy for some time
so
I thought I didn't want to go down.
again this bad way
I just want to get better
So I had to do it I had to get help
I go once a week
I feel like you have the right therapist.
It's really useful
I had a therapist I really liked
"and I thought we could have gone really far, but"
"Unfortunately, she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles, so I have to"
"I have to deal with this new therapist, and she's fine."
she is not
we are not going to sleep
"So great together, but she's the one I've had right now"
It's better than nothing <Laughter>
Not so easy at all
um
since <yawn>
I came out of the hospital and started
and I started taking medication for my depression
i um
I just couldn't sleep well.
Sleeping is hard to stay <Laughter> Sleeping is hard
have really
Crazy Vibrant Dreams
who wake me up and disturb me
um
I just guess
sometimes they reflect
Things I'm Worried About
"or happens in my life, but they are just"
"they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mother how we were here, we did that did this really happen"
and it's usually not you dreaming that
sometimes I get so scared I like to talk in sleep and wake myself up
Probably <Laughter> like two nights ago
This is a
hard question
I think
November <yawn>
after I got out of the hospital
I finally had a good day
And my friend took me with him.
downtown Chicago
and we went to the sailor's tower
and must look
"about the like big windows you go out and see the city, and that was really cool"
<Laughter>
super starting
He likes to be at the center of attention
funny and a little crazy
I'm not trying to regret things in my life
oh
um
I would say that
Life is worth it
and don't be afraid to ask for help
"If you need it, don't wait until it gets really bad"
I guess my ideal weekend would be <Laughter>
Sleep and then
Catching a movie with my friends
maybe go home with them and
Bake some biscuits <Laughter> eat all cookies
watch some t_v have a sleep over
and then how to make pancakes in the morning
and see more movies we see a lot of movies I would like to do that <Laughter> in my spare time
"go for a walk I don't know, go to the beach <Laughter>"
That's a difficult question.
"I mean, I think I have"
I've done a lot of great things in my life.
and
I've achieved a lot
but
I think one of the proudest things
proud moments in my life is something really small and insignificant
I did this training boat camp and
the last person who crossed the finish line had to like
Thirty push-ups and
"It was a guy I didn't really know him at all and the coach said that someone wants to help him, if someone helps him, you have to do half everyone"
and no one wanted to help him and I just decided to start with him to make push-ups
and I just
It wasn't because I wanted to get credit or because I thought it would make me look good that I did it.
"and no one really knows about it, but it's just me feeling really good about it"
It was nice.
It meets you <Laughter> bye
