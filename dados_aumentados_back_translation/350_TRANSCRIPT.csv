value
Yes
"I'm fine, thank you."
original I'm from good I was born in mississippi so I'm from golfport mississippi
Yes
"I had no choice, I was a child that I moved here with my parents."
< slaughter>
When I was two years old
"Yes, I was a toddler"
yes I like to travel and I travel a lot
to be in new environments and new people uh different things
<Cough>
"Well, one of my favorite trips was the visit of africa"
in I think two thousand six I visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical help to the people
"a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved, so I went with her and it went from there, so I don't know that I made the decision that way"
I'm glad I did what I'll never forget.
< slaughter>
I studied English and education so that I could teach high school students
Currently not no
Now at the moment i to tutor privately for a private tutoring company and look to work back in the classroom as a teacher
mhm
Wow
all that uh combined teaching travel and writing would be a dream job for me so
"Yes, everything that combines these three elements, so the teaching has the next result that"
um 
occasionally yes <Laughter>
<freezes the neck>
"I don't know, I think compared to others who have said as outgoing and and a lot of people I seem reserved or somehow introverted I don't know"
mm
All right.
"I don't know that I read, I just started meditating."
mm try to breathe and soothe <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
some things that really drive me crazy
um 
Mistreatment of children
Child abuse
Try to figure out what usually bugs me and then you go from there uh when I can
"Control not annoying as ultimately I control that whether or not I'm annoying, so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not get annoyed if I can help it all"
Oh I'm okay I can totally <to> when controlling my temperament I think so I don't have any yeah
The last time I had a fight with someone
was
"I don't know, maybe a few days ago and it was about"
"It was about a smell they had on their clothes, but I thought smelled of perfume and they said it didn't do so <Laughter>"
"Yeah, that's good."
< slaughter>
That's cool.
"I think I'm very close to my family, we're a pretty close family conversation every day to see us almost every day."
There were a lot of positive re-influences in my life I would say my aunt and uh definitely my mom were all positive influences
"Well, I look, I see, I clear throat, I look at my aunt, I think she's positive, I look at her,"
"because we obviously grew up with very similar backgrounds, came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and it is very successful, despite the kind of things we have been through as children."
and she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom has overcome so many obstacles uh she's had some challenges with her health but she's still trying to be optimistic and she's still trying to
"They know to overcome these things and only our lives despite some physical barriers that they might have, so that I can become people who are able to"
"They know not to allow their current situation to dictate their future, because everything is possible"
No I didn't
no
I've been
"Well, I was diagnosed to"
within the last year and uh then last again in the last three months
All right.
Afraid and just not knowing what to do with some of the things I felt
And not knowing about
You know why I couldn't stop feeling how I felt
There were many symptoms.
um
"You know, mostly I've gained a lot."
I couldn't sleep much.
and then I could sometimes sleep too much <Laughter> around
Sometimes I was sad.
how I wanted to cry very much
I felt good.
I don't know that every day is different.
"I mean, today I feel good, but as I said, everything has been different lately I have felt to be more than I can be involved in my own life and how I want"
out and do more things
um 
no no it's no no i haven't 
not different from
before what I experienced before
no 
mm
good mm I got around
I guess psychotherapy and...
"I don't know that much has happened, I moved to take care of my grandmother for a while."
more involved in the care of other people instead of me for a while
sometimes
I know.
"Yes, it is."
"It's kind of difficult, I either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep"
"I'm sure it's just I don't know what it is anymore because I know you, < sniffle> normally it's about thoughts running continuous thoughts through my mind"
that either stop me or make it hard for me to go to sleep uh or make it hard for me to sleep
mhm
To Journal sometimes uh that could help if I write down some things and it helps out that
otherwise I don't know that I haven't found any really good ways to cope
it
tired <Laughter>
"Yeah, mostly uh tired around"
kind of confused
"I don't know that I usually feel happy, it's just..."
the last time I felt really happy I was thinking about the holidays
"Uh, I don't know, I guess that just around uh family and friends just the Christmas time I think in general this is just a happy time for me"
and seeing people I haven't seen in a while.
That's it.
how my best friend would probably describe me as around
quiet sometimes cautious talky sometimes around persistent
I don't know that many of my friends say that they're looking to me for some of my accomplishments and
"They also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because I am caring and compassionate, or"
To just talk to around
that I put her to one of <o> me like a sister for her
< slaughter>
I'm sure I regret things.
Rightly
"Relax and be yourself and just keep going and it sounds cliché and I don't want to sound like that, but it's true, it's just about you having to learn how to feel and relax with you and just know not to compare yourself with other people"
because what someone else does or where they may be in their lives at a certain time is not necessarily where you
"You should be or what you should do at this time does not mean that you are less competent or less able to do it, it just means that everyone has their way and everyone has their way."
"their time and their development, as they get to things, I would say to myself ten years ago, only"
believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that I want for my life and not be
"Yeah, that's good."
to really enjoyed working with to good
All right.
