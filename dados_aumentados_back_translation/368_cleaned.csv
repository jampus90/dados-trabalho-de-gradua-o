value
"Yeah, I'm fine with that."
I'm fine.
I guess...
Scrubbed_entry
I'm basically a guy
Cool
um
"You know, the weather it's usually pretty sunny and temperate you know, I really like the climate a lot"
I like the girls you know here.
"I like to see, I don't like the traffic you know, but"
I like the Hispanic population pretty well.
"And I have a lot of friends here, so I guess you know I don't want to be anywhere else"
"I mean, like I said, the traffic you know I was on the four on five, you know, that's always kind of you know crommy"
"the cost of living you really know, terrible about l_a it's always expensive"
and
You know I don't like it.
I really don't like you knowing them.
"as it seems like to l_a's one of those places where you are you know that you either know like one, a ton of money and fame and fortune or as you know that you know below in which you know the ghettos you are"
I've been to a few places.
"Uh, you know, but very briefly, you know, it was mostly for school."
I went to arizona and new york and montana a lot of anthropology as you know and archaeology field trips and such things
"Uh, nothing I'm doing right now"
I like to get away from the city that you know I was in Yosemite last year you know summer for vacation that was kind of nice you know Yosemite was really around
"really nice to see, but uh just basically getting away from the city I guess you know away from work getting away from the stress here"
Uh I actually studied political science and I also studied economics around
"I'm a great kind of policy you know junkie you know to start with, so I naturally somehow fell in line with this type of study"
"It was me, but I lost my job."
And you know that's kind of a moron that you know I lost it.
"Oh, my God!"
"It's been a year and a half, now maybe two years and a half."
um
You know that the economy got bad and budget cuts got bad
And you know I wish I'd work there again.
uh
"I wanted to be a lawyer, and I wanted to be a lawyer."
and so I took political science and I took a double major in economics
"and uh the sad thing is the sad thing I regret is that I know anyway you know to get into law school, you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats"
and I studied for it how really hardcore you know for about a year and I took the xxx test and like an idiot around I didn't feel right about the day it was a kind of day off
"And you know, it was like you know the big game at the Superbowl that you know, that I just don't feel like I did it well and I canceled the test and all that around"
"You know, I kind of regret that you know"
<Laughter> Tell me about it
"I'm not really shy, I'm definitely not shy."
but starting I don't mean one of these people <peo> I'm not flamboyent You know I'm going to talk to people I don't mind talking to people I don't mind
"I'm meeting people who are good with me, but it's not like you know I'm dying to meet someone."
I guess...
around these days uh you know I play guitar you know I taught myself how to play guitar
um
I know I should have done more of it.
"but I also like to exercise around uh I'm on a diet right now, but my diet was terrible time eating habits were terrible"
"but the exercise part is just great I love to train <exerci> I love to run, this is one of my best things to do for stress is how to run and how to train"
"I just wish my eating habits were in line uh or a little better you know,"
To <sigh> my temperament you might know definitely improved uh a lot you know to
"You know many times I feel I'm one of those introverted guys people when it comes to how you know that I don't mind being extroverted or meeting people and like having a good time, whatever"
"When I'm angry, I really don't want you to talk to people I don't like screaming, I don't like screaming, I don't like beating, I don't like fighting, I kind of close up a lot, I don't just want to be left alone"
sometimes I tend to put it on longer than it should be
"You know, the woman doesn't like it too much, and maybe I know I just don't want to talk about it <Laughter> I just don't want to deal with it."
"I kind of shut down and shut down, you know?"
Switch off for a little bit
"Oh, my God!"
um
You know it doesn't happen too often.
Maybe with my wife
You know that we were probably something stupid that knows
Who knows?
um
the
"I mean, I don't have a lot of guilt, I'm not doing anything to make me feel like you know a person you know is bad."
"There are things that, as you know, I call minor sins"
"You know, I get white lies or whatever you know, but nothing like so disgusting that makes me feel guilty."
um
"Let's see, I guess,"
Sometimes you know.
"You know, I'm a married guy, but I know sometimes there are times you know I like it"
"You know you're smiling at a girl, or, as you know, you're getting a girl's attention, you know, I don't know that I never go, I never do anything about it, I never get her phone number or as you know, but"
Sometimes I like it
"Talk to people, I guess"
you know
That's a good question.
I guess...
"I guess you know I always do the same thing, there's not that I never want to change, I never want to deal with things differently"
"I'm always pretty comfortable how I deal with things and you know I think I could be much worse and as you know, screaming and screaming and beating and that and that and that and that"
"And that's just not me, you know, I think the best you know is kind of like"
get a lot of breathing space a lot of space and around I don't want that to change or treat any of it differently I just don't basically know what else to do
You know.
"And you know, the last thing I want to do is talk about feelings, or talk about anything that you know that's the last thing I want to do, and like I don't want me to treat something like that differently."
"You know, I'm pretty happy with my family now, you know, if I'm married and we have a baby on the way"
Which is kind of beautiful
around we have a few cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and around my mother I love my mother intimately
um
She has diabetes that she doesn't control.
"You know, she doesn't control it and likes it how uh it affects her health and it always worries me about her and how stress about her and she could do so much to prevent it and she doesn't and"
"I have a good relationship with my mother, I love her very much and I really have a good relationship with everyone I think"
I think I've got a ton of family and friends around
"who get along pretty well with me, you know actually"
"Yeah, that's good."
"There are times that are good. I mean, it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep. I feel like you know I'm sleeping like a baby."
the only problem I have
I think
is I feel
"how you know sometimes how you fall asleep and you're just going to sleep and you're kind of like a yolk you know how you almost like a case, anyway it's like a falling feeling or something"
"and it doesn't happen so often, but it happens"
and around but for most of the time <ti> part by no I sleep like a stone I sleep really well
"Well, right now, I've felt in general."
worry and and fearful and
"You know, uh, and tense and the reason why is because I said my mom to right, at least today"
"Well, I found out that my mother did something that she didn't tell me the whole story, and I kind of wait until this is over so we can figure out what's wrong with her."
But...
"You know, I'm worried about her, she's in the hospital, she's with the doctors right now, so that doesn't tell me anything good."
"and to you know to try to find a job, so that also got me worried"
"and you know the baby on the way, so I got worried, so I feel like a [sharp inhalation] you know, overwhelmed with a just a lot of how you know how to do things and how"
and
"much on my much on my plate and how much of it has nothing to do with me, but I have to treat it the way you know, the way I think"
"Well, I keep distracted I keep myself busy I feel like a busy body you know, and the more it seems like you know it seems like it's not a good thing because I feel I'm just adding more things on my plate"
so
um
"You know how one of the things I do is like exercise and so I have to train every day that you know, but that takes an hour, as you know, change and you just start to run and how to go through the whole thing of stretching and cooling, which takes some time and then like to shower"
"all the kind of stuff takes time, so I have to do it every day so that I can finish it this way"
"I also finished knowing you're playing guitar, but that only"
"more of a distraction that you know what I mean, keep you know to keep busy as it seems simple as if it wasn't"
"You know to work towards you, know the goals"
"You know I have to do as you know I can find a job I should do, but then..."
"You know, it's one of those things where I don't think there's any good jobs I've been looking for and looking for, and sometimes when I do, it's just not what I want to do, it just doesn't seem"
For example:
<Laughter> as I want uh
Make one of these like terrible jobs
I xxxx it's you know it's it
"Probably harder than I think about it, because sometimes I feel like"
"You know, one of these things is like, uh..."
I feel like it's hard
"But it's not I mean, there are ways to deal with it"
"You know, I kind of have to accept that you know that I sort of internalized it."
And how uh you know
"It's not something that's like I'm not out on the street or something like that, but you know it's a concern."
I've never diagnosed with p_t_s_d I worked with.
no
no
Man
"Ten years ago, <Laughter> I don't know, uh, see, the last time I was really happy maybe"
"I mean nothing, I feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know I learned to feel a new song on the guitar <fe> I feel like"
I'm not even happy that you know I'm like...
"You know, I work sometimes and that makes me happy that you run as fast as you know, but that doesn't make me so excited or anything."
I just feel good.
"You know, so I have this this"
in those times when I'm just you know I'm feeling good
"about me and I feel, you know, but I never feel great I never feel happy I never feel as sensational as you know and and"
And you know it
I can't believe you know it's just...
You know there are these mild times when there are some good times.
"you know and a few bad times, but the good times are never <n> never <ne> never extremes"
you never know really good times and never really terrible bad times you know
"Well, I wish this diet would work a little better you know, but that's kind of hard you know because I like the kind of guy that just likes"
"Who likes you to know about you, rice and how uh mexican food and how <Sharp inhalation> you know to and to snack and uh"
"I don't know, I just feel like I could change I wish I could change my eating habits as I can"
"as you know, because I'm learning so much that I feel like I'm running as much and doing as much activity as you know."
That if I mean you know diet in check around
"You know this would go a long way, I wish I could change you, too."
my <m> my
my uh
I guess my
I feel like the economy is so bad.
and how things are so rough that
"You know, it's like pointless, even if you know looking for this kind of jobs like"
it just seems like I just wish I had a little more inspiration to like a lot more motivation
to <Laughter>
<sigh> does things
The one thing I regret is not
is not to you know is this lsat thing you know about
you know
"I can't cancel the test to start it, because I'm sure I could have gone to a school, but then, as you know, it made me think that I really want to pay a bunch of how you know law school and the cost of it and how"
"You know, just to..."
just to be stacked with more work and so on anyway
I don't know it just doesn't seem like
How uh
"I mean, there's an idea of justice and"
and around and republicanism
"And you know things that I really know you, stick to"
that I fall in love with
And that I don't want to get away
But it seems like it's a lot of work and money.
"and easy to like it for the small percent of success,"
that you know that maybe you don't really make such a field that you might know that maybe I just don't like
It's worth overcoming the obstacles I have to overcome
ugh < sigh>
I have no idea I would <Laughter> I would <wu> twenty years ago I would tell myself maybe
um
"You know, I think I've done everything really well for myself, except for the lsat thing you know which I'm going to do."
You know the regrets on one side on the other
"You know, I'm not sure I regret it because of the bills and all the stuff I told you about,"
And you know
"I think you know that I was waiting to get married, that I was waiting for a kid."
I've known you pretty carefully about the decisions <deci> You know I don't take drugs I don't drink I don't fight I don't do any of these things like things like you know that
"I think that real people know,"
And then she really as you know ruin her life you know like
I'm pretty happy and satisfied with
You know the godfearing whom you know.
uh
I don't know.
"Oh, my best friend, I think he kind of likes me <li> he likes me he wants me to do more things with him, but he works at night"
"And you know it's one of those things I think most people not only have my best friend, but my wife and maybe the rest of my family."
feel that I don't put much
"Time and attention to them I mean, they think I'm pretty great when I give them the"
"Time of the day and my attention, but I don't know if I'm really there all the time you know, I don't know if I'm real"
"You know, I'm always thinking about something else I'm always thinking about something else"
I don't know if I can really give them a real one.
"You know, shoulder to cry, or you know, if you ask for something you know, I'll usually do it."
"You know, but I almost feel like it's like a job, like you know, like she's..."
you know
"If they really need me, then I'll do it, you know, if they're just asking for a favor"
I almost feel like you know I'm doing it.
"I just feel <f> and it's not because I hate them or anything I really like, it's just that I have the feeling"
"I almost don't want to say that I owe it to them, but the mere fact that I'm her boyfriend somehow makes her..."
"You know, uh"
"as I do it anyway makes me, as you know, they rely on me some you know times or how I don't want to let them down they're my friends"
"but it's the same time, I just feel like it's"
it's more it's not it's not it's more like doing a job instead of a job.
"a willingness like an oh my God, as I just want to help you, it's never <ne> it's never that it's just something I do because I somehow have to know you need to know"
"I have to do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know, and I end up like them, and they'd probably do it for me."
"And I know you, so I just..."
"Well, there are a few things I like that I have good <go> I feel good about myself you know"
You know I ran the marathon that feels good.
"I graduated from college that feels good, you know what I mean, but the thing is, I don't feel that way."
like pride in myself
"Because you know these things alone, like studying from college"
"You know I didn't really succeed, you know what I mean."
um
Running the marathon didn't make me thin and trim
So they're like half the merits
"You know, or how they are, they're great, you know, Lotta people may not have done half-way, a lot of people have gone beyond each other."
But...
"You know, they're kind of like kickstones that like"
that around I seal real new no
Life < l>Lifelong
benefit from other than the fact that I can say that I have done
