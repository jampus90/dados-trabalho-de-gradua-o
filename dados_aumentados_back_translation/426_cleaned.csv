About Psychology

"it was one of the classes I received in most excellent, so I decided to change it from the economy psychology"
"Yeah, that's good."
Yes
no
to own my own record label
um
"It's moderately heavy, but you know."
Take it one day after another
I guess you know
Stay Concentrated
a little of both
um
I tend to be shy
"Situations I don't feel comfortable with, or I'm new to"
and I'm going to places that make me feel better
"Yeah, that's good."
um
turn the lights down and listen to soft music
mhm
I'm getting better over the years
um
I think I'm
pretty decent now compared to how I was
"Yes, ma'am."
um
due to the lack of I think you could say to control my emotions
I was detained and sent to prison.
"Yeah, that's good."
mm
I'm not sure.
uh
I don't really have a memory of my toughest decision I've made in my life
It was probably a few days ago
"The girl I talked to, and I was arguing about it."
lack of communication
and attention
"Yeah, that's good."
Frustrated
Because...
You know you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect
"You know, the same effort"
by the other person if you are in a relationship
"and at the same time, if you, if you expect sometimes you'll somehow feel for failure so"
"You know, I guess I'm just learning"
There are many situations that I would have dealt with differently.
likely
the youngest was uh
I had got into a physical <phy> a physical confrontation
with a prisoner
When I was incarcerated
and the
made me
"That sent me to prison, and I had to spend a lot more time with it."
and
if I've treated it differently
"I probably never would have gone to jail, I probably would have been home much earlier."
when I was originally
"Yeah, that's what happens."
mm
there are several events I wish I could erase from my memory
um
likely
My first girlfriend
um
She did something really extreme.
It wasn't necessary in my eyes
and it and it cost < co> it could have cost me my life
I think that this is a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase from my memory
together with the good memories and
um
a few that you have few
Fighting
"Uh, I guess you could say shoot outside"
To jump to be robbed
You know the things that inhibit me.
I guess to explore
certain areas of life I am not
convenient with so these are the few things that
It would be nice if I could completely erase it.
"Yeah, that's good."
To hurt people who didn't have to be hurt
emotional especially around
a few women in my life or in my past
um
Probably to bring my mother through certain things she didn't have to go through
together with my close friends and family and
Um was once rocky
"grow up, but when I got older and matured"
and
"the certain experiences that I brought by some kind of brought me closer to my family, so now it's pretty decent"
It's pretty decent.
I'd say my mother
um
"Yes, my mother."
um
well she uh she had her share of experiences
Negative and positive
I admire them
The fights she's been through
um
She She Uh Experienced Difficult Economic Difficulties Growing Up
But that didn't stop her from raising a son at a young age.
Graduation of the school get her master
and simply to be a good person in general and she also fought mental health issues as well as
and
probably not the best of the family
"that she could have been raised, so she's kind of like an inspiration for me and other people, so I'd say my mother"
mm
It's not easy.
"So yes, it's not easy"
I couldn't tell you I've always had sleep problems.
Usually I just take uh like over the counter sleeping medications or nyquil
but
"It makes you sleepy the next morning, so it's like"
it's a negative effect really
"Yeah, that's good."
the medications <medi> I don't know anything
"I don't know, but I just stopped taking it because I didn't like to feel sleepy"
Not good at all
um
"Yes, I mean"
I was recently released from prison not too long ago
I'm older.
Now
and much more responsibility and I feel like my life isn't where it's supposed to be
I feel like I could have made much better decisions in my life.
you know
sometimes pity for myself and only
Things I've been through and all the nine yards like this
"Yeah, that's good."
It's all right.
"Yeah, that's right."

"I don't know, I guess the school asked me for help because I started,"
Understand myself
How my brain works
"You know, so I decided to look for help maybe"
"to improve my life, yes you could say that"
"Yes, I am."
Yes
"Yeah, I actually do, I do."
mm
Better decision-making
um
better tools to reflect decisions
How to Control
uh
certain situations better yes
um
"<sniffle> good, instead of always reacting to emotion, no matter what kind of emotion it is"
I'm going back and I'm going to evaluate the situation
You know what is the best way to react
on the situation
and by doing this
it has made me more mature
Emotional mature
and only
has a positive result
um
I was lying next to a beautiful woman
"who cared for me and the feeling was mutual, so that was probably the most"
Happy
"Oh, my God!"
spontaneous
um
Outward
sometimes a little crazy
um
Fun
That's it.
Nothing
"As I said earlier, only"
you know you're in pain
"the few women who have been my past in my life, and"
"my friends and family, that's it"
Shit!
Uh school is really important
um
how I wear the people with whom I surround myself
and what I decide to do in my spare time
these are the few things I would say to myself
good music
um
a good game of basketball
To Sex
um
I like to go out
I like to go to parties
For social meetings
"where everyone is friendly and there is no drama, that's what I like"
Dance beautiful women
"a few drinks, that's all."
um
I guess I don't necessarily give up and
only
I don't know.
Just keep going
not really give up
"Yeah, that's good."
mhm
See you.
