The advice I would have given myself
that I would probably not have been a young mother at a young age and that
I probably would have done it.
stay in school you don't know that the accident only distracts me and not I would have stayed in school I probably didn't have children early you know about
I would probably have stayed at school and probably had a part-time job or something just I feel like
Education is an excellent thing for a person who only knows and learn different things keep your mind open for learning new ideas every day
"So I think this is a plus that you know in one's shoes just to be better, that they know each other through education, maybe to promote in your company or whatever the case may be, that they help you improve your career"
I'm not quite sure.
"You learn from your mistakes you know, but at the same time you don't keep doing the same things I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change yourself, you know like me, even though I'm going to school late, but still I'll let you know that I want to make myself better."
Yes
My oldest daughter
We had a fight because
only
the life she is living and the things she is going through
and I had told her that she just had to make some changes to improve her situation
And we fought because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it.
"hear the stuff you say, even if it's true, or"
"Or they just know that they just don't want to hear it, that they might be going through something they don't want to hear, but we were arguing about it, but..."
"that just happened, you know,"
I just told her it wasn't me.
I'm sorry.
very close
very close it's just that the situation is my daughter in her just needs to make some changes to improve her life
"And I'll say,"
She's...
"She's kind of stubborn in her way, as you know, that I was raised to listen to your mother, you know, your mother won't tell you anything wrong, and I've told her over the years that you know different things, and it's kind of like I've been talking to a wall because she's done the opposite."
"And now she's sorry that you know because she's like my mother told me that you know Mom that I'm doing the opposite, so I guess she's gonna have to bump her head a few times to get it, it's kind of like I told you I left it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change."
"It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she doesn't hear me and I'm like it's gonna take forever to change, but it's up to the individual whenever they're ready, you know what I mean, if the person gets tired of something that makes them change it, it can't be if you want to do it, but"
The ball is her yard you know.
I can only do so much
Oh wow
I've had my days around
Since I'm two little ones around me kind of like trained them to go to bed at eight o'clock because you know they have to go to school and I think it's important to have a good night's sleep because it kind of like
"It's like being ready for the next day, or you know how you feel when you rest, what kind of person you're going to be on the day you know, because everyone has their days, whether it's good or bad, but that's just a part of life, and I feel like when you've had a good night's sleep, I hope you'll have a good day you know"
"Pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving the bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job yourself when very stressful, so I feel when I'm rested it will help me"
what am I so tired of lazy
you know
"Feel like I want to lie down probably going to sleep <Laughter> the rest I need, but <Laughter>"
I never thought of that.
All I know is that you know.
"Because like I said, you know everyone has their moments that I've never thought of."
hm
no
no
"I don't really have a best friend, but a person I've been dealing with and who I've been working with, she'd probably tell you that I've bypassed a Go better a lot."
Reliable responsible
I'm a man-to-man person
"I get along with others you know, I'm kind of like"

I leave a good one a good sign
"whether I know you or not, if you know how"
"Like you and I now, you know that I..."
"You'd probably say, oh, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know, something like that"
