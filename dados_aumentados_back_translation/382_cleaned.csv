Yes
"it's pretty difficult, but it's uh fun"
I always had an interest <inter> interest in uh film and film as uh it seemed like a natural choice for me
uh lasted about a few years
But...
I feel like I've gotten used to it.
"I like it, it doesn't snow, it's warm weather."
and there is much to do with many beaches
"Uh, transport"
and the cost of living is quite high
"I've never been outside the U_S, but I'd like to someday"
uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance
I like listening to music uh making crossword puzzles
Reading and hanging out with friends on weekends
Very good.
hmm
uh
"I don't think it was argument maybe < may> maybe a difference of opinion, so it was more like a debate"
but it was pretty tame
I think it was a
Debate on sport
over a basketball <ba> a basketball game
and uh
I talked to someone on Facebook about it.
"but I think it's good,"
"to express yourself if you have a disagreement, it's uh"
It's natural that you know.
not always agree on matters
so
I think talking <ta> is healthy <hea> is healthy
I have a very good relationship with my family. I get along with all my family members and expand that you know cousins and aunts and uncles.
So uh
There's no one I've ever had any cracks with.
hmm
with my family
hmm
I probably could have been more disciplined than I grew up.
and
more
uh
more discipline with schoolwork and homework that somehow something
But for the most part I had a good childhood and there's not much I would change about it.
hmm
"probably leave my comfort zone in uh South Carolina to move out here, that was pretty"
"hard, but at the same time it was"
Uh exciting
so it was a bittersweet feeling
um
"a lot of excitement mixed with uh some fear, but it uh"
It went away pretty fast
safe
no better at school uh when I was in high school
"I could have been a more diligent worker, and I could have done a little better."
hmm
I always had a strong support <s> uh family support system
and uh parents and uh siblings
so
This is definitely a positive thing.
hmm
an event
uh
"Probably going back to school, I wish I had uh"
"I wish I'd done better at school, so if I could take something back from my past, it would be"
Uh scholastically related <sch> scholastic
It's pretty simple
when I don't sleep well
I tend to
kind of laxadaisic and uh
just tired all day kind of groggy
"Uh, no, everything's pretty much the way it usually is with me."
I felt pretty good.
"No, I didn't."
"No, I didn't."
the last time I felt really happy around
"I made a lot of money a few weeks ago and I feel like I'm ahead of the game, with you know, with the rent under control and a lot of bills out here so"
I'm still somehow having the lasting impact of this happiness
"Yeah, that's good."
uh
if i
"when I have money, I tend too much uh"
Uniform
"not evenly tempered, but I tend to feel better about things"
and more optimistic

and uh to have
xxx have sources of income
uh
I think I'm creative
and I think I'm a good listener
hmm
to be as disciplined and focused as possible
because if you're out of your
Parental homes and their lives must be
"The better you're in school and the better you are, the better you are."
"as far as discipline is concerned, the more pleasant your life will be and"
Much eh uh
Your life will be much easier
hmm
Let's see.
I wish I were more
Disciplined
but I'm working on it and I've gotten much better
at the
"It's become pretty easy, I think I'm just getting older around I'm from my twenties now so"
I definitely saw a change when I first got out of here.
hmm
um
"some people tend to say that my decision to move here was not feasible and a kind of pipe dream, so somehow I felt bad, but"
Uh I kind of take insults in step and around sometimes I'm welcome
constructive criticism
Because some things aren't right with you that you're not aware of until it's mean and it comes from the right place
"I think it might be an invaluable uh tool that you know what to hear, what other people do"
must say that this could be negative
hmm
likely to be optimistic and
um
are optimistic and
uh helpful

"You know, packed in the car and only uh many disposable income"
And you know good weather
"I probably haven't been to Vegas in five years, but..."

I'm doing crossword puzzles
and I think I have
I think I know what's important in life now and I'm more focused and I'm going after what I want
hmm
I'm not a big fan of high taxes

But it doesn't really make me angry it makes me frustrated and uh
I guess I'll take it in step but
