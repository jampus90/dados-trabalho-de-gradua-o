All right.
Virginity
I wanted to live somewhere else than virginia with a little more variety
"Um, once a year maybe"
It's...
it's much slower and there's much less to do
I wanted to live somewhere else and
a nicer warmer climate and around somewhere where there is much more to do and
There's a lot more going on.
It was really easy for me because I wanted something <someth> it was very different and I wanted something different
I like...
"I like to do all the things, like the museums I like"
the beaches and the mountains and all
Hiking and doing all the free things
"People don't appreciate what they have here, they just want to come here and take something with them, but they don't want to give anything back."
bad drivers
Not as much as I'd like.
"Travel whenever I can, but usually it can not afford that much"
mm
"Well, I like to take"
I like taking pictures and I like it
new places to explore my wife and I like to see
flora and fauna and migration; and
Monuments and only different areas to see
um
We're good.
"We went to central California, where we would like to go."
"more international places, but that takes a while to afford, so we went more local, so we went to"
um
we went to hurst castle and to see the sea lions around
the
Elephant seals and things like that
um
I guess our uh
I guess our palm springs trip to our anniversary we have the

I guess somewhere in between
English and Film
"Well, I..."
They told me I had to go to college and I hadn't quite decided what to do.
chose something I would like to do for the time
All right.
I wish I had
"not put under pressure, so I had more time to find out what I wanted, I might have done something else like physiotherapy, but"
Uh no I've been teaching <t> gymnastics that's something I do earlier
um
I didn't have to starve
and
"I did it, I'm not as bad as I thought it would be I went for it and it ended up kind of fun"
Dream is to have money and not have to work for it
Overall pretty good
um
"I don't remember what, but it would probably have been"
A few weeks ago with my wife
"Well, everyone I ever really upset and"
"Scream, I always wish I wouldn't, but sometimes when someone doesn't listen, it makes me crazy"
You know if I'm just...
"to say something over and over and they just don't listen, it makes me really angry"
To <sigh>
I don't know
"I spend a lot of time with them, but"
"I don't know what the most difficult thing is, because if I decide to go with something, you know it's usually for good reason."
"Well, I think I feel guilty about moving to California and leaving my family in virginity"
"I mean,"
"I know I shouldn't, but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like it"
"Living there, you know, I'm the one who moved away, so it's like I left her."
"Well, I mean,"
"I don't miss virginia, but I miss her, so I guess a little hard"
I have a good relationship with my wife and my parents-in-law with my mother and sister.
"No problems, everyone gets along well"
mm very close
um
I mean something <anyth> anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise
it depends on how much exercise I have
a lot of exercise it's pretty easy if I don't
um
Just like now a little bit
"slow and out of it, but"
not really...
otherwise too different
"Um, I just walked down 'cause my..."
My mother-in-law dies and we spent three days.
"in the hospital and we will go back after this, so not much time to"
Sleep
mm
Just...
just slower <sl> only slower and
tired and
That's all.
no
no
um
Usually only if I have <havi>
Having a fun day either alone or with my wife is pretty easy for me to just be outside and
and uh and hiking or exercising it's not hard for me
I'm not sure if...
Maybe

Be careful with your

Work to make sure you don't get hurt and to
"I don't know, just your normal"
Your normal type of
uh older type of wisdom <sigh>
mm not much to say really everyone recognizes things when they get older that they want they had when they were younger
I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back in shape like I used to
That's...
the biggest thing at the moment
um
"not much to say, just hurt my back at work and"
I just like to come by because it's
You know you're keeping me from doing a lot of things that are everything.
To do well as I used to Uh gymnastics and trampoline and used to be much more active or exercise and now I can only exercise a little because it hurts too much
um
likely to be the same as during the
during the day go on a hike or in a park with my wife and
uh
enjoy pictures and wildlife and movement and then
"in the night, you know, we're watching a movie or going dancing or"
just something like that
um
very proud of the
"I mean, I came here without knowing anyone."
I was at a point where I could stay in Virginia and feel comfortable and
"You know, in the end, I did something that I regretted, but I came out and I always thought that was a good decision."
mm
my parents my grandparents my wife were most people in my life
See you.
