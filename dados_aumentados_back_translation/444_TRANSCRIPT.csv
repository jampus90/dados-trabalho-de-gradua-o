To and just get a different perspective
on the world
and the prospects of the different people in the world
and because America tends to be isolated
I wandered the Incaweg
when I was in
uh peru
and that was a five-day hike
Start from the Cusco
We climbed for four or five days.
Ahem and woke up
on the last morning
at the Sungate of Machu Picchu
"and that was just a very amazing experience, because I would only see that I had seen it in national geographic"
You know my whole life
To be there like that
and experience that was phenomenal
Philosophy
I graduated in philosophy
i working part-time in art
♪ Empty the throat ♪
good I started in business
and I was very disenchanted with him very quickly
and so I decided to study what I wanted to study
While I was in college
and had the opportunity
"So that's what I wanted to do, and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher."
"But I had the idea of getting my philosophy degree, then going to law school."
and to be a professor of ethics
But this species fell apart and that's actually how I
End until joining the Peace Corps <Laughter> So it all worked out
I'm sorry.
"Yeah, yeah, that's good."
"I'm sorry my alarm goes off on my phone, it's gonna die in a second."
"Okay, I'm sorry."
It's still working.
"I'm sorry I turned off the phone, but I forgot to turn off the alarm."
which should go
"Okay, what's sorry about what your question was?"
My dream job

Outward

"Okay, I'm sorry."
"Yeah, I turned off my phone, but I didn't turn off the alarm."
It's like I forgot it was my alarm to go to yoga class.
I'm terribly sorry about the <Laughter> okay <Laughter>
< slaughter>
Sorry to interrupt
I have a real fish tank.
at my home and I do the same thing and I do it with my kids when they get upset about me sitting in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing
I also try to meditate
I'm trying to sit down and be calm.
to collect and my thoughts
I like to read
and by or sometimes I go or I take my dog for a walk
"I wish I could say I was good at it, but usually I tend to have outbursts."
from time to time
When things get too messy
at my home to
and I feel very underestimated
I'm going to...
You have a
Outbursts of anger
"Yeah, my husband doesn't appreciate it, and I've never done it at work or in a social situation."
but at home with my family I did it and then instead
To realize that I'm upset about it.
My husband tends to get mad at me because he's angry.
and then escalates and
uh
Sometimes I just end up walking through the door
or go to my room
hmm
I'm sorry.
"Usually, after I had an outbreak"
And I isolate myself for a little
I can come back relaxed
and handling the situation
in a
more
Quiet way
"Sometimes it's very difficult, but I've come to the point where I know just to"
Stop and get me out of there.
And go and breathe deeply
and then really try to figure out what I feel
why I'm angry why am I
um
So tense
and then be able to verbalize that
um
good i i it happens a few times when I start getting
I had a very tense day.
"Um, and things didn't go right."
um
I tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while I make dinner
And the children are all at home and they ask me questions about their homework
or they turn on the t_v or and my husband is uh
I'm worried about things I just don't have to think about.
"And once I said, okay, everybody in the kitchen let me out alone"
Just let me finish dinner.
and no one would
and I just had more pressure to build and build
and I actually took one of the pots and just hit it against the stove <Laughter> really hard to get like people
"Watch what I said, it actually made a dent in my stove <Laughter> , which is still there"
So I should have done it.
went out early and took my deep breaths before I did
um
It was probably when I was pregnant with my first child.
I wasn't married.
I had a very good friend.
um
Oh I was I was
Thirty-two at the time
"So I was uh you know I wasn't young I think if I was younger, I'd probably have decided to do an abortion"
"But at this point in my life I'm fine, I'll have that"
um
and I had
um
I got pregnant by the man I was married to and still married to.
um
But we were only together for three months.
and I lived with
"a good friend of mine, who I share in the Peace Corps"
"Um, and she and so I didn't know this guy very well"
I didn't know if we could raise a child together.
I didn't know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with someone else.
"Um, and my friend suggested that we raise the child together."
To even suggest moving to Costarica to raise the child together
um
and so it was a lot of
um
Large decisions
who would determine the rest of my life
um
and i
the decision based on:
more common sense and practice
um
but I don't regret this decision
I think I made a good decision.
to marry my husband and
Raising Our Child <Laughter>
"They're older, now my eldest is seventeen."
he is around <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he is very specialized in engineering
he gets his pilot's license
I'm very proud of him.
Then my daughter is
15 years
and she loves acting
She has a boyfriend.
Who's that?
Uh they see only once a week in the church basically
And they keep texting themselves
She's a very typical 15-year-old.
And then I got a twelve-year-old
"he is extremely active <Laughter> and is in constant motion and always makes noises, but I love him very much"
He likes climbing and there is a climbing hall near our house.
"so he has a membership there, so he goes over there and climbs almost daily"
no
I find it extremely difficult that I wasn't.
my mother had a very difficult <d> my father died when I was young
and around my mother somehow separated
When That Happened
So I had no very warm or loving
Relationship with my mother or growing up and I basically grew up I was
from a very young age on your own
um
"I mean, she was in the house, but..."
"had really no interaction with her, so I really didn't have"
Parental skills
You know that most people will be brought with you.
um
I know what I'm not supposed to do
but sometimes it's very difficult and
I see my friends you know.
very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they make cookies and everything is biological and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect
And it's like I'm not that person.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
I'm trying to be
I'm I think I'm a very good mother
But I'm not...
a typical mother
I think I'm more
I'm more creative.
many times me and we do a lot of things
"But it's not a warm, cozy thing."
"When we camp, it's more"
I'm more habitable when I go camping than I am at home
I think I'm more tense when I'm home
but I try to like through meditation and things of this kind that I try to become
calmer and more patient
I think my patience is what
I have to work the most
I've been a sleepless person all my life.
I remember when a child was lying in my bed watching the stars walk through my bedroom window and
"I haven't slept well in a long time, but I realize that when I do sports"
and I do something intellectually with my brain during the day
I must be physically tired and intellectually tired
Sleep well
And that's hard to do sometimes.
And so many times I stay awake and read
I'll read until midnight.
And then I try to sleep.
"Usually I won't get up again, even if I wake up at three."
"and such things, but I will try to sleep again"
Yesterday I didn't feel as good as I was
I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday
Because I planned to work on my garden.
And then I build a butterfly garden in my front yard.
So I had to plant something.
and I just couldn't feel like I was doing it
"I wasted a lot of time yesterday, but today I feel really good."
so I feel more positive I feel more energy
so
no
no
um
I don't know that I just got a new mattress.
didn't really help me sleep
But...
it was really good because I needed one for a really long time
and it was just kind of excited to be delivered <deli> it delivered and furnished and that sounds like some kind of secular
But it was
You know exactly how
"I'm finally doing something positive, because it's"
It's something I postpone to do and postpone to do and postpone to do
and it was like finally
"Uh, there and concrete, and it's like it's okay that I've done this job, that I can check my list."
But also I have the children camp over spring break and
We just had a fabulous time and we sat around and told stories and around the campfire and made S'mores and such things and these kind of times make me very happy
<Laughter> I don't know about
I think she's...
believes that I
uh
uh
more intellectual and smarter than I think I am
Sometimes she comes to me with a lot of problems.
uh
she always asks her advice from me she thinks I'm giving her good advice
"And if she doesn't know what to do, she'll ask me."
And sometimes she just calls me to run things.
Uh or just like to complain because I'm compassionate
"Um or empathetic, and"
I'm just here to listen.
And I don't need to give her any advice.
I think a good listener and
good advice donors
I delay a lot
I start projects and I don't end them.
"I'm working on a lot of projects that I've started in the last few months, many of them are really creative projects and"
I'm very excited about them when I start them and I will
Almost finished
and then
"I don't know what's happening, I'm just losing interest."
um
Sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to end it
"that sounds a little strange, but"
um
I'm working on it.
I'm trying to take care of them.
"Oh, my God, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
do not follow through on the odds that I had when
I came out of peace <p> Peace Corps there were a lot of things I could go in I would have gone to get my master's degree
um
with a scholarship and such things
but instead I got pregnant and married
and I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed
"But the second time I got pregnant, it was right."
where I had to fight for a management
and I realized my limits where I could not be pregnant and have this child and did everything I had to do to get a directorate
"and so I really wish, so that I resigned"
um
and I wish I had held on to it
um
Because then I would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and
solid career
um
not
Base decisions on emotions sometimes i around and not I have had some really bad bosses
The jobs were wonderful.
um
but
My ego got in the way
"And I would've told myself to let go of this aspect of the job,"
the
selfish
Reactions I've had
to the bosses and focus on the work and do that really good
about my children actually
um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal
Ahem and
Uh people are really interested and they were like awe that
You know someone who really did this so I'd always be when I was a little girl.
my neighbor was one of the first people to go to the Peace Corps when it started.
and I've always said oh I want this one day I want this one day I want to do this one day
and then finally I came to the point where I had to either shut up or do it
So this is
That was
one of my proud
Experience
All right.
Thank you.
See you.
