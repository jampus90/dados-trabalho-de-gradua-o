Yes
I'm fine.
I was born in Eichenland
around <sigh> all different areas of the city
Uh the different cultures that are here
the transport of
Lack of public transport
and the superficiality
< slaughter>
I wouldn't like to travel anymore
To <sigh>
to be able to experience a different way of life
"You come outside the bladder you normally live in, and"
to get a different perspective
in two thousand eight I studied abroad in Brazil and that was about four months
"and I was in Bahia, which is in the north and around"
"Let's see, the program was to learn the story, learn the language and stay with a host family."
"I've always wanted to travel, and I chose Brazil because..."
they have an Afro-Brazilian population or a large Afro-Brazilian population that I really wanted to learn more about and I think the story and the Kullture is really interesting
um
I think I'll be alone with a bus.
a remote beach and only navigate on your own and find out where to go
"Yeah, that's good."
At the moment I get my master in social work
< slaughter>
Dream job <sigh> I think to advise on mental health and
How to
how to intervene effectively with different cultures
and research and advise and travel
um
essentially that this would be the main features
I think it's a fake dichotomy.
"but I think I'm shy, but at the same time walking in the sense that I'm pushing myself to do things outside my comfort zone"
and I'm determined to do what it takes to succeed
< slaughter>
I listen to music
and just lay on my bed and
um
I guess you could say to be mindful and really distract me from things.
"also breathing exercises, about which I learn more, as well as movement"
"pretty good, I don't get angry often"
um
As far as angry temperament I'm pretty good at that
hmm
um
mm which month this month may be
Probably two months ago
and I argued
"via SMS <laughter> so it's not really intense to argue, but"
I guess you could argue in a sense whether I should be forgiven for something I thought was inferior
um
with a friend I've had for a few years
I felt scared
um
sad and angry
um
"Yes, these are the most important emotions"
I know her because I think I'm pretty in touch with my emotions and able to identify her
and then I will notice the physical
Uh manifestations of emotions like when my heart is racing or when I am sweaty
"If my breathing is shallower, I know I'm afraid something's bothering me."

that I wish I'd handled differently
"I guess, in the context of this argument,"
I went out one night and got
a little too intoxicated and < clears throat> ended
to call one person for a ride
"at home, but that"
really upset this person
and I know that
"It wasn't such a big deal, but I wish I hadn't let myself get to that point."
it influenced a relationship and I also felt really bad about what I did

Difficultest decision <sigh>
Wow around
probably decide what type of graduate program to go into I short law school and decided not to do so after
well after taking off I really had to
think about what it is that I wanted to do and what I wanted to do
dedicate my life to go into debt for a lot of energy for

I think by recognizing what I don't want to do
and a lot of research on
Program requirements and the jobs you can get after completing a program
<sigh> mm <sigh> I have to think <sigh>
"Oh, [Laughter]"
um
revolve around the same person I was talking about earlier.
It was a dating relationship and
A few years ago we had a fall
about his treatment from me
and it involved
another person and I wish I could
I'll get that out of my head.
To <Laughter>
< slaughter>
"I have a pretty good relationship with my mother, she lives in the bay area I didn't grow up with her, but I did"
to get closer to her as an adult
We talk quite regularly
with my father I grew up with him
he usually lives in atlanta and
"We don't talk so much, but..."
we are
"we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really,"
It's quarrelsome or something.
"and I'm a single child, so I don't have any siblings I don't have a big family"
That's why I'm here.
"in general, I'm not really that close to the family"
um
one person is my mentor whom I met in two thousand five
and she's a judge and I met her when I was on the community college and she really
opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that I would be able to achieve certain things
"<sigh> pretty easy good it's easy for me to sleep, which is not easy to get up"
because I don't usually look forward to what I have to do on that day
And the thought of it is
"You know, I just want to stay in bed, I also wake up pretty tired"
not really feeling refreshed
♪ Empty the throat ♪
I just think <sigh>
Self-talk about how what I have to do
is not so bad or that the things I do now will end pretty soon with the end of the school year
um
try to think of things that
I can look forward to the week to listen to music too
and surfing the Internet somehow gets my mind going

emotionally emptied in some ways and
at the same time the feeling that I have achieved a lot and that I have grown
such a mixture of ambivalence and feeling drains and a mixture of
Feeling reached and proud at the same time
"No, I didn't."
Yes
in two thousand six
the convergence of many stressful factors
"I was out of contact with my mother, I started to be good, I had moved to a university that was pretty strict."
and all these changes go on
Really...
aggravated
Things that were already there were depressive tendencies that were already there
and it came to a point where I felt really overwhelmed
"Yes, I do."
Yes
I notice
I'm better able to
accept my feelings and do not judge them and also identify them
I am [sighing]
able to think <th>
think differently about the things that happened maybe you see things in a more positive light
and also identify
the areas I need to work on and the underlying issues in these areas

what how old am I twenty-eight
Ten years ago eighteen okay so graduated from high school
I would say to myself that I should collect more work skills so that I don't have to fight so much in the future.
and look for mentors to get a clearer idea of what I wanted to do as a career
