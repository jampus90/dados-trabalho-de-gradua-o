value
<sync>
<Sigh>
Yes
"Uh, okay."
< slaughter>
The Angels
the weather
um
the diversity of the environments of the ocean you know different environment or environment diversity
< slaughter>
I don't like the superficiality of people.
around the narcissistic attitude around
I'm just...
the
It doesn't have a small town where you feel.
They only know the heat the human type of heat interactively
so
"Yeah, that's good."
no
"I'm afraid of flying, and I've developed agoraphobia."
< slaughter>
Uh incredibly difficult
"Yeah, I guess you mean the agoraphobia more than the fear of flying."
It's more of a new development and...
It's...
"Oh, it goes on, <pregr> continue to get worse, uh, it's very..."
What's the word?
immobilization and and very oppressive
Mhm <Laughter> yes it is
How to Cope With It
Just...
I'm just trying to uh
do what I can and uh try to you know have the most courage I can in the situation and challenge myself in order to take small steps
to I read a lot I read to bibliotherapy read around
and I try to inform myself
the professional literature so that I can hopefully overcome it one day
mhm
"Uh, yeah, definitely."
um
uh certain things trigger it like around closed rooms
um
travel in a car around
I'm away from home to be in someone else's car.
Things beyond my control
um
Uh xxx actually I'm not going to school right now
My dream job is
To be a psychologist <Laughter>
"I'm not a psychologist, but what would make me do that is..."
uh
"to have experienced some challenges such as these, to have experienced some traumas"
But I've always had an interest in it since the junior high of
um
uh
I am very interested in people and in the human interaction and in the human connection and
To make these things better...
bridging people and helping people in person through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges around
uh
So this is kind of about it in a summary
um
I think I'm someone who
"I can be very outgoing and somehow a warm and friendly presence very light, but I think on <o> on the outside around"
but I think I'm shy and I challenge to do that
I think I'm shy in my heart
"But I challenge myself because I love human interaction, so I take these risks and jump and these challenges."
The last time I interacted with someone was <Laughter> today
when I think I understand your question right
"Oh no no anyway I think I'm misunderstanding your question, but I interacted with rachel around I'm just to interact continuously with people"
take these risks
"Um, very good."
mm
Very good <Laughter>
um
When was the last time I had a fight with someone?
I can't remember it wasn't new <Laughter>
I have to think that I don't know yet.
I draw an empty... I can only remember things...
of when I was like twenty-one <Laughter> now
I can't think of anything contemporary right now.
My mind is
"Okay, when I was younger"
"Yeah, I lost it."
a relationship with my aunt
and my uncle and my cousins
"For when I was twenty-one, I was forty-five"
um
i um
uh
uh
had a disagreement with my aunt and I said something that was uh critical
from her and
She threw me out of her house.
and
uh
Leave me back to uh I apologized immediately
And they left me in their lives
and changed her mind so
I regret that
um
"I suppose you mean, how did I feel when they asked me never to be in their lives again?"
and to leave
shattered soul shattered heart shattered
"Well, that was my family, the..."
the good side of my family is around uh
"The majority of my family, they were the loving aspect of my family, the rest of my family, is very cruel and how very abusive."
I don't have a relationship with my family at all.
How the
Since I...
Twenty-one since my aunt and uncle.
uh
denies me I think is the right word
estranged yes
um
I'm drawing an empty bear with me for a second.
"Um, something I could erase."
<Laughter> I can't even remember it
um
Uh as an example to
uh
I was hurt and I wish I could get that away from my memory
"Yeah, I know."
I was injured in the ER.
Scrubbed_entry
I went in for food poisoning.
from a doctor around I had collapsed and
I was instructed to go to the e_r because I said food poisoning and I came out with a neurological syndrome injured I was with an injured
What do you call that?
Uh intravenous procedure uh and now I've got uh
r_s_d reflex-like dystrophy
"and it was the scene in the emergency room, it was a scene out of control, there was a problem with the procedure."
"And the doctor cried out to his staff, who made a mistake."
um
eh and it was extremely painful around it was a crisis
and so every time I think about it
the injury and it was uh disfiguring I was disabled
um
for <f> i uh was disabled for it uh permanently around from it I was also around
uh hindered by my employment for quite a lot of quite a lot of time as well
and
and I have left it around
physical trauma of him and distortion and around
Severe disability < Disabil> Disability limited by
um
Functionality uh with my right my
I'm right-handed uh with my right hand
and arm
Thank you.
I don't even know what that is.
um
i
You know I really do.
I apologize because I can't give you this.
uh the most appropriate answer to
uh
I guess it had something to do with...
my cat and her
Your xxx urgent uh
um
What do you call it?
She was in intensive care and I'm sure it had something to do with it.
um
"But unlike that, I would say that I chose my way of life if"
Scrubbed_entry
"Um, and uh, I was admitted to this program."
Or if I went to art school for four years...
"and I had to choose a way of life, but that's not a traumatic situation."
I don't know how to answer your question.
I can't.
"Um, I just..."
Severe nightmares <Laughter> and I have to be nocturnal
Uh panic attacks
and I also have physical illness on it and I am in painful pain
Yes
Yes
"Yeah, they're triggered by the injury I told you."
They're being triggered by my family.
um
"They treated me, what they told me, what they did to me."
They're triggered by...
what else around mine around my physical illness not my injury only but my physical
Sickness also
So yes.
um
I feel very sick
and
feel so tired
very sick and very tired
um
when I don't sleep and sleep enough around uh my anxiety level I think is up and
I'm receptive to feeling depressed.
um
So yes.
Yes
about three years ago around my latest um-diagnosis
"And in two thousand and one,"
uh yes
um
Three years ago and around
When I...
20 years old
around the background of my childhood
from my family of origin around
and their around Uh
You know the abuse I've been through.
Uh and her ultimate um uh
What's the word?
"Rejection from me and alienation, that was the first reason"
um
"No, I quit six months ago."
<sigh> um
Why did I stop to just take a break <Laughter> I'll continue
Yes very
It has helped tremendously
um
I think it helps with fear it helps with
um
it helps to inspire to create inspiration it helps to
um
Uh feeling connected
"to help create what I'm ultimately about my goal,"
to give me a voice and to
um
uh it helps to do <d> to uh
It's part of this process.
It also helps to understand myself to learn about myself.
um
and anyway there are only as many advantages it is
i
"I'll stop right away, there's a lot more."
mhm
um
the last time I felt really happy
It was a really long time ago around it was before my illness
Um and it was in nineteen ninety seven around the beginning of my illness was in July of ninety seven so it was around before that <Laughter>
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"I was in a very good place, in terms of my career."
In order to:
"Um, just my relationships and um everything was kind of best around"
Career relations
Personal fulfillment around somehow
also around I was very active and did
many things that were meaningful to build a life and I was in the process of
"especially in the planning stages of my life, but also very successful"
"at the same time, so it was just things just went very well and around I just really liked uh"
the place where my life was only in a really good place in many ways
mhm
I wish I could change about myself.
I wish I could change for my agoraphobia.
my p_t_s_d around means my trauma around and around
uh
What else...
um
"My insecurity, as far as..."
uh
Just...
with <w> with other people in the sense that I always try to make sure that
that I don't do something that...
Wait a second.
I'm just trying to make sure I don't do anything that offends or offends her.
um
or uh is disrespectful uh and I feel like I'm too careful about it and uh
it will somehow be a fear for itself
So I definitely think that would be useful
"To change the other thing I want to change about myself, I wish I could feel"
And also depression that I want to change about myself. I wish I could feel better.
I wish I wasn't feeling.
"Um, um..."
I don't wish I didn't have the burden I'm doing.
My family doesn't have one.
um
I wish I hadn't had my illness and the physical
"Um, agonizing pain I'm in, so these are some things..."
and I also wish that
and this is a by-product of p_t_s_d I wish I hadn't had to
uh
Symptomology
"of p_t_s_d, because this is definitely about"
affects a complete <com> completely the complete life like anyway a lot of their impact on their life uh completely
and I wish I were more articulate
and I wish I was someone who was well-spoken
and someone who is well written
But there are many more.
Things I wish I could change about myself to improve myself
so many more
<sigh> um
I'm not sure.
< sniffle>
Maybe not to be so trusting
I have faith.
I trusted some doctors that...
"You know, again caused the injury"
and
You know that
There's a uh
What's the word?
There is an expectation and a kind of demand to live up to
blind trust for the medical profession and
<sniffle> um
don't ask any questions and just somehow change
you know
and when and not to trust your own self your own around your own instincts or intuition
and so I would
I would have told myself to be more careful.
I guess if that's what it is
useful for your question
< sniffle>
What did I really like?
You know I can't figure anything out.
But...
I know it should be...
either read or re-read
Connecting with someone on a meaningful level
< sniffle>
I'm very proud of...
my compassion
um
my around my uh empathy and caring for people
um
"I mean, I'm proud of it."
but also especially <sniffle> around I come from a
To an environment that is the opposite to a background and I was not taught that < sniffle> but I really care about the people and about
"I'm very proud that I'm proud of my career, too."
Benefits
around and mine for perseverance around my grim <fie> my grim perseverance to be successful
To <sniffle> and uh
"You know, just to get the power that it takes to get through"
injury
Uh living with it and living with the disease I live with the physical illness
um
So I think that's it.
< sniffle>
Yes
All right.
You're welcome.
See you.
