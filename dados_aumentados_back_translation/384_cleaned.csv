Activities all the time
New life
Uh reasonably simple

and there's always something to do
hm uh
Transport

new places to see uh and new people to visit
a few years ago I went to the Catalina Islands for my birthday
I've been to the Catalina Islands all day.
I took a boat there.
uh
Hopping on the plane and leaving indiana forever
All right.
Sleep

To be a filmmaker
Because it's a job I haven't had yet
not too hard
shy
hm
because of my past
For the
simply have difficulty finding new friends and
Just let people trust
All right.
Uh t_v watch or go to the movies
I really don't have a temper.
"When I was sixteen, my stepfather"
Because of the nightmares I had.
I was just having nightmares about my childhood.
about my involvement in my biological father
"So far, I have no idea if they are or not."
Go for a walk or drive.
Uh maybe a few days ago
I just walked around the block a few times.
Pushing people away
"Uh, I guess,"
try to trust them a little more
Let her in my life a little more
"Well, that would be easy, that would be the first half of my life"
It would be easier to start a new life if I can't remember my old one <Laughter>
uh
really i mm all my decisions is not so hard that I try to avoid stress and everything so that I don't really make hard decisions
uh
good every time I push someone away I wish I'd treated all these situations differently
Uh good uh whenever someone interferes too much in my life <volve>
I always say or do something so they want to stay away from me
That's what this is all about.
Depending on the type of person they are
"I really don't have a relationship with my family, I know I have a sister somewhere in Vegas."
one half of a brother in Indiana
My stepfather's in Arizona.
except that I have no relationship with any of them
um
We really don't talk.
So it's kind of hard to talk about her.
edgar cayce
well he died far before I was born and I only know him like books and documentaries
Uh really not so easy around
i
Usually you usually take me like a few hours to finally get to sleep as soon as I lay in my bed
Uh well basically I try to lie down I have stressful < s> race or stressful thoughts
a few times I could even try to listen to music for an hour just to see if it calms me down
Stressed
and just yeah just basically a little stressed
"Well, I've been feeling a little bit excited lately and"
I just wish my life was different
"I wish I had friends and loved ones and all this and I wish I had a real relationship and everything, but I didn't"
"Well, lately, I've been living, I'm moving a bunch of stuff."
Things from my stress <st> Life stressful things like
Invoices and what not
and try to keep it simple
uh
to make sure that there is the least amount of stress in my life by
only
simply remove different things from my life and try to integrate new things
Yes
I guess we're number sixteen.
Nightmares
Uh held back for a while because it got too stressful
"Well, basically, I just..."
I pushed her like I was getting rid of her from my life because I didn't feel like they were really listening to me or anything.
and uh
"Yes, so I just didn't feel too much useful help from them, so I was looking for alternative means"
"Uh good, basically like music and"
force me to like different social events
Yes
Depressive
"mm only, but basically just depressed uh keep me locked in"
Don't talk to anyone
uh
"Uh, I guess a few days ago"
"Okay, well, basically"
I feel that the best way to keep people in my life is
with fake people in my life through online multiplayer games with avatars
and user names and everything and
I'm just having a little fun
go with these avatars in virtual worlds
and talk to people like that
So they don't know who I really am
You don't even know my real name.
Okay good my ideal weekend uh let me see
"is uh if I don't work this weekend, I'm going to get up maybe like Starbucks or a Mcdonalds go"
get something online while eating or drinking
Maybe play an online multiplayer game for a little while
and then later in the day maybe go to a movie
whatever it is that's playing
Uh go somewhere else relax watching something t_v
um
and maybe a d_v_d film and
um
or I could spend the day driving all day to a place where I haven't been before
or it's been a long time since I
Just try to spend the day in this area
and only
"Yeah, that's the weekend."
my life
"I just regret how my life developed, I wish I had a normal stable life."
uh
Let me see ten twenty years ago
I was special
uh
I'd just tell myself to keep a diary or something.
Basic
Tell me yourself.
how my life will develop now
so that hopefully the other I will make other decisions
Oh my mind
"Well, I wish I was a little healthier"
"I wish I had looked a little better, I wish my vision was"
Much better.
and I wish I had a bunch of people in my life I could call friends
um
I'm a fucking genius
I could
"Everything I'm good at, I've learned to teach myself."
"So basically, I can't get a career in this kind of stuff unless I go to school for it"
but
It's hard.
It's basically easier when I teach myself than taking a kind of class to do it
"and everything, because"
Yeah basically <bay> yeah just basically
the fact that I'm a fucking genius okay
Thank you.
Have a nice day
