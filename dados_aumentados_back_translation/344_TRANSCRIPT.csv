"I've been in the military in one point in my life, so don't do hardly a lot of travel anymore"
different sights see different people I think it's more the people and
to be different types of a city and people <peop> see meeting with different new people

mm disciplined more uh
Motivated
"You're gonna do a lot more, even if you don't want to do it."
"you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated by the stuff you really needed to get ready, but you didn't want to do it, but it was done"
How...
You had to clean a lot.
"You had to wake up pretty early, you had to do a lot of p_t, you had to stay up to two three in the morning, you only got up four or five."

After the military I joined the National Guard and I did uh fifteen sixteen years there uh I was
"Sorry, ma'am, I didn't hear that."
What made me do that?
uh
just the motivation just know you really wanted a career to see if I could find a career out of it and it helped me a little yeah
Thank you.
It wasn't that easy
"I mean, I'm sorry, it was easy, it didn't bother me too much to return to civilian life."
Yes it didn't bother me at all I just <ju> I have adapted pretty well
Uh <sigh> story basically a lot around
"Yeah, basically just history."
"No, I'm not disabled."
"Oh no, it's okay it's okay we can all I can cure I can get better hopefully I'll"
"Yeah, I'm trying to get a"
"Excuse me, ma'am."
I guess I don't know.
My dream job would probably be
with others working with young people working with children to see that they know the right and correct uh uh education you
That is up to them so that they can be productive in the life of society as we live today.
"Yeah, that's good."
Excuse me.
<Sigh>
what I think about them I think they should be uh more
"more uh <sigh> xxx i mean you should participate <sh> <tapicitat> more in what they do in their life, they should ask more questions, they should be more motivated, uh"
really achieve something
in their lives to give them the mm to give them the trust and motivation they need in life
Because many of them don't understand.
When I see people really do things they really shouldn't do
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
I mean really bothers me and when people
"Talk to you, they'll give you the round, it's like you're not just being honest with me, instead of just giving me the round, you're not just going to be honest with me"
This can be very frustrating
"Uh and really, if people really do, I'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <Laughter> that really messed up me"
uh spray painting on the wall
uh
only
Throw away garbage and don't pick it up
"don't really be, you don't really know to be"
"Hygiene You know, take care of yourself and hygiene You know what I mean"
"Yeah, that's good."
"<sigh> what I do when I'm upset, uh I'm really upset I'm really starting to lure people out, to be honest with you"
and it's something that's not really me
But I'm learning
"really let it know a lot of you, only you know, just say hey, that's the way it is, it's like I'm not in control I can't control it"
yes I just have to control things about what I do and really get upset by what other people do is not really good
It's not good for me.
Oh my temperament can be controlled I can control it pretty well
uh 
I don't know that it was probably my sister.
and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and I don't have mine to tell me what to do
"Yeah, that's good."
"We are very close, I can get along with them, we are very close, I have no problems with them."
"Yes, very good."
uh 
This morning <Laughter>
"Yeah, I wake up nice on you know I'm the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning I pray so"
when my mind is in contact
with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world I feel pretty good
Yes
"Up and down, you know?"
up because I'm motivated to come out and start doing other things in life than just doing nothing at all
"and then other times where you want to achieve something and you can't really do it because there are roadblocks in the way, but uh"
I'm learning how to overcome these roadblocks.
uh 
"good for example, uh looking to go to school and I had trouble getting uh enrolled in school"
"I talked to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me go online and do it, so I'm like okay it's good it's going to be done <Laughter>"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Um, can you repeat that again, ma'am?"
"Oh, yes, I did."
saw I had to be
Uh <sigh> I'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh
"I noticed that by certain situations like you I talked about the anger situation it's as if I wasn't angry all the time, that's not me, so sometimes when I get angry, I need to figure out what causes all this, what causes me to get angry"
and I have to take
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"It's not hard at all, because all you have to do is take your time and think about everything you've been through, and take a close look at the situation and, uh..."
and then go from there and find out what is what really bothers you
It is very rare
uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh get this kind of sleep
would be great
"because I have recurring nightmares, so of an incident like this"
<Sigh>
"I think it's and I don't know what it's triggering, but I think it's and that's why I'm talking to someone or someone because I'm a veteran"
at the uh v_a about the situation now
about the p_t_s_d at the moment
"Excuse me, ma'am."
uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares many problems many anger problems uh depression
I've noticed all this in me and uh
I started telling myself I needed help.
"And that's basically it, I just know, I just know that I was something not wrong with him something wasn't right with me"
"And if something's wrong with me, I have to take some time to look at myself well and ask myself if something's right, if something's right, then that's fine, if something's wrong, then you have to take care of it."
And uh I just started looking for help down there yes
"something yes, it's something"
Because I can sit down and talk to the therapist.
"Well, I'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and tell them my situation, and we're usually going to go through the problem."
and uh
"I went to class to talk to my doctor, so it helps me a little."
"Yeah, that's good."
It's a good thing.
"Excuse me, ma'am."
no
"No, not really."
My best friend
She would describe me as a funny loving good person always there trying to help others uh
"think more of others really than of myself, but if I know I have to do things for myself, I'll take care of it."
"So you know it, and they really look up to me, they have a lot more respect for me."
"Yes, they see something in me, they wish that they"
"Excuse me, ma'am."
uh you can be a little more specific
"Oh, all right."
uh books crossword puzzle
Walk
That's it.
"I thought I did, but I don't think I regret anything because"
"that's what it is, this is the way it is to me, so I accept it and I move on"
"Because if I regret something in the past, then I'm wasting my time on it because it's gone, that's the past I have to move on, I have to live in the present so that I can be prepared for the future so that I can go into the future."
"Yeah, that's good."
<sharp inhalation>
uh <sigh> more education uh
I am more direct and trusting in what I do
"as I am today, so yes, that was what I was missing about twenty years ago"
uh yes <ye> yes I had been a lot of positive people in my life
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
yes some people would uh uh well consistent <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivating me
a certain goal to pursue and uh I thought that was pretty good because I really don't see that a lot
and uh
"he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things, because all you do is make a choice, it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that the choice is still to be done on you for it"
"Excuse me, ma'am."
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
that I am able to really be motivated myself
"and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things that I thought I couldn't, but it can be achieved"
when I'm ready to put the will to do it
Oh wow huh
Oh really and you know what I really enjoyed
sat with my social worker and we talk about doing things in my life.
and school was one of them uh
and just school was one of them and I liked it because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me
"Yes and I thought that was a great thing as long as you're ready to do that, I'm ready to even go the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school"
"And yes, that and that and that get me going"
Oh it's and I love it and uh that will be achieved
Thank you.
Goodbye.
