Two months ago
two and a half months
I was just looking.
just wanted to be in a new environment
"Oh, yeah, I'm ecstatic"
Very happy
uh it took a few weeks just to be adjusted
Because I didn't know anyone.
the weather is probably the best
Yes and uh
I mean differently than that
it's pretty much the same as anywhere else I've been
there's nothing I don't really like about l_a
"It's just you know, only the weather is the best part of it"
"Yeah, that's good."
I like to travel
"I didn't travel much in my life, but in the past."
Uh year and a half I've done
quite a trip made
only different places see different people new people new faces
new places
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"Let's see, last summer I spent the uh summer in Cleveland."

Yes and uh
I stayed in a hostel the first hostel in Cleveland
Scrubbed_entry
and
I did a program with the uh.
Scrubbed_entry
and it was basically
we will
go to various urban farms throughout the city and
Voluntary
approx. 25 hours per week
So yes.
really a spur of the moment kind of thing
um
I wanted to try something else I had never done before.
and agriculture is one of those things you know most people
would never try
"Because you know, because of a certain stigmatization that's related to it."
uh
And you know
I thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that.
"Yeah, that's good."
what in the uh
uh mm
Urban agriculture or in general
in urban agriculture uh
"I don't know, I guess uh"
"I don't know, only the general experience just go"
"You know, food uh go to the farmer's markets and eat all the fresh food and"
only see the difference in
You know how fresh natural foods taste anyway you know
unlike the foods you buy in a grocery store
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yes, it really is."
I had two semesters.
of uh college and I was undecided
So I only took general courses.
My dream job
What are you doing?
I guess my dream job would be
"<ss> everything that includes <invol> uh I don't have a certain dream job, but everything that concerns nature"
I'm just outside.
I'd like to...
I wouldn't mind being like a forest ranger or anything.
"As long as I know,"
"Yeah, that's good."
I think I'm more shy
I don't know why it's exactly like that.

I don't know.
<sigh> <makes sounds with mouth>
"again I don't know, because"
I don't know.
about things that have happened in the past
"Yeah, that's good."
< slaughter>
mm
Maybe whether or not to come to California
I guess that was a tough decision.
All right.
I don't know that I've been thinking about it.
You know you're moving to a new place for a long time
and <sigh> I guess
The hardest part of the decision was
think that:
whether or not I was
safe or not
You know what I mean
um
just go to a new place where you don't know anyone
uh
It's kind of...
You really don't know what's going to happen.
so
uh
There was a lot of uh
you know
Anxiety in this
in this Decision of the
Should I go to a place where I don't know anyone I don't know?
you know
Only
only perception has ever had <ha> that I have of this area
You know what I saw in the media and t_v
So you know it
"Oh, yeah, I guess that was"
Difficultest decision I can imagine
"Yeah, that's good."
"Oh, guess what."
nothing absolutely nothing
"Yeah, that's good."
uh
Nothing
I don't feel guilty about anything.
Relationship with my family
I'm not very close to my family.
I guess the person
"I'm closest to my mother, but you know, I don't know that I never really talk to her much."
uh
I don't know my father so well.
you know
<makes click sounds with mouth>
< whistling soft>
< whistling soft>
uh
I guess my grandmother
"Yeah, her."
"Yeah, she's..."
She's very...
xxx how should I say it uh
She's very
She's a thinker
I put it as if it were very instructive.
so
um
"Yeah, I'm looking at her."
for a lot of advice because
She's been through a lot in her life
"and I feel like she knows she's been through a lot, so she understands a lot"
So you know it
It is a very positive influence
very simple
uh
Perhaps unsafe
I'd say
because
Now I really don't know.
in which direction I want to go with my life
and there was a lot of confusion with the
um
but
you know it's not
"It's not something that overly affects me, but you know it's always a thought in my back of my mind, it feels like"
somehow
Maybe I'm running out of time
"and I know it's not that it's not xxx, that's not a realistic thought, because"
I don't understand how you could run out of time.
but
"Yeah, I guess so."
only in general
don't know what I want
But I know how
How can I handle this?
How can I handle this?
I don't know that I'm thinking a lot about it.
Seeking a lot of soul
"It's not hard, I mean"
"I mean, I'm"
It's xxx.
"as I can't say, it's hard because it's one of those things that"
I feel like it's necessary
and
You know certain things in life that you just
You're forced to turn yourself in.
so
"It's harder, I think it's harder to avoid"
this kind of things
"Yeah, that's good."
no
no
no
uh
xxx today
when I was talking when I was talking to my friend.

would he describe as a nice guy
uh
guesses instructive
mm
Stupid.
and
"Yeah, that's good."

no
Ten or twenty years ago
"I guess I'd say,"
stick with what I love
