value
Yes
"Oh well a little tired, but uh I found out that my thyroid is I think so <Laughter>"
I was born in Canada
and but I have lived most of my life in California so
"And it's gray today, too, so the gray weather makes you kind of sluggish"
the < slaughter>
"Oh, my God, years and years ago"
I don't think I've been back a long time.
"Well, air fares have risen quite sharply in recent years, so gas prices have risen."
"Traveling as much as it is a fun thing to do, it's expensive, so"
uh huh
"oh let's see, everything has plus and minus for cold weather <Laughter> not so much sun, so I think I'd rather have more sun and the warm weather so but different from the"
It is very pretty back there natural landscape and
"But I like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy, but that's a little thing, with"
so
mhm
"Why did I move to L_a because my family came here and started, uh my dad has a job here and"
that became our home base and uh
That's why
easy very easy so
uh huh
Uh good at high school you're generally studying ed yeah it's they've set courses and then after that
"went to college and I was a business major, let's see, I was a veterinary major <Laughter>"
and uh I graduated with a degree in Liberal Arts so
um
I don't know.
can't really determine why <Laughter>
so
"I worked in social services, but I also worked in sales and most recently I do real estate"
I'm a leasing consultant part-time
"I mean, everything has plus and minus it's okay it's not I don't really see too many negatives"
oh
likely to work as a uh gossip columnist at
t_m_z or any of these networks < laughter>
"but as you know, everything in the entertainment business is very competitive, it's who you know so much"
but that would be my dream job or probably work with uh cats you know animals
so
"I'm very starting in fact, I think I'm going out so, I scare people sometimes there's a lot of rest"
"You know the reserved people out there, so I'm some kind of east coast very you know I go to people and talk to them very socially"
"Oh, my God, there I could do hundreds of things I could read, I could watch a show that turns on the music is great to"
"Go for a walk, uh, call my friends."
Millions of things <Laughter> like this
"I'm pretty good I'm very good I mean, you know, of course, if you drive in l_a and someone"
"Cuts in front of you sometimes this can be irritating, but I'm actually pretty I'm not the kind of person who fight or get I don't like to have confrontations so"
mhm
mm
I can't remember.
"as I said, there are not very many arguments usually i"
Avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so
I don't really feel guilty about anything <Laughter> now or that I can imagine
mm
I can't think of anything right now.
i
I really can't think of any decisions that were really tough
"I mean, most of them are pretty easy for me to make a decision"
"So I don't have a family, so if I need to know that I had to move to San Francisco once to have a job, but"
"Since I'm single, I don't really have to consider other people and children and"
"this kind of thing, so it somehow makes certain things easier if you don't have to look at family"
mm
"Yeah, that's good."
an event
hmm
"Well, obviously you don't know that a family member you know you want everyone to be there forever."
"So I know when my father died, you know, I mean,"
"I wish I had had him much longer, I mean, he died at the age of seventy-seven and you know, would have been nice to have him a little bit more"
but
You know you can't control these things that life has to do with.
the
so
mhm
"Yes, there are <Laughter> Yin and Yang who are old uh"
Philosophy and it really applies there is a plus a minus and negatives and positives
so
"as I said, my father is no longer here and my mother and I know you have our differences I think moms and daughters always do"
around my brother and I understand myself well I see him a lot I see < s> my sister works a lot
"I see her, and you know we're talking, and she has her own life and her kids I know well with."
so
Mhm we have a small family
"Uh <Laughter> Once again it's like this is a difficult question to answer, there are so many"
"Guys of kids out there, I think"
"Most of them seem pretty dazed, I mean, you know, there's always gonna be kids who kind of got out of control."
But...
"I don't know the ones I saw recently, they're very"
"well dizzy, so can not say much more about it"
"Now <Laughter> I live in an apartment <Laughter> and I don't know if you've ever lived in an apartment, but..."
"There's someone living above me, I'm on the first floor and there's someone on the second floor and they're pretty quiet, but..."
They have a habit of <Laughter> I guess they have a lot of energy around them will usually shower around midnight and sometimes they will start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes
run through the bedroom wall <Laughter> so <Laughter> it sounds like Niagara falls in there and uh so I don't
Yes and I need eight hours of sleep and I just got
"Oh, I'd say maybe six hours, and then I usually wake up at night, because sometimes they're just..."
"About two or three o'clock in the morning, they're either walking around or I hear something like that."
I don't exactly get eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <Laughter>
"But there aren't, like I said, things you can't control when you're living in an apartment, you know, I mean, the lady's very quiet it's just that she's got a habit,"
you know
"under later showers <Laughter> Wash laundry at night, that is"
I can't tell her about it.
so
"Yeah, but you know there are people who are in worse situations, so I don't make much of it, you know it, and I don't like every night, but you know it."
"at least twice a week, so I know I may have to sleep in another room, but"
"For now, you know I'm gonna deal with this, like,"
"tired <Laughter> very tired and hard to concentrate hard to concentrate it only takes longer to do things because I don't have my energy too I didn't train I usually try to go about half an hour a day, but"
the weather was a little colder and a little drier so
"You know, I'm not so motivated when the weather's kind of blah, so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours of sleep"
mhm
"Uh, like I said, uh, tired <Laughter> I'm"
It's a combination of the weather you know and here in Los Angeles at the moment we have very gray days I live very close to the sea
"So the sun doesn't get out so much, so I don't get my serotonin <Laughter> I need the"
i um
"I can't get my eight hours of sleep because you know,"
"Whatever and I think my thyroid's too high, so that's kind of"
Create you know I have some vitamin deficiency
and
"You know, as soon as the sun comes out, I'm kind of more energetic it just gives you more energy like this."
Not mm mm
no
I'm happy most of the time I'm a pretty happy person
"and I like to be other people I mean, of course, I like my private time, but I like it to be people pretty much so"
hmm
"I mean, I usually enjoy everything I do, there's nothing that stands out more than anything else."
"No, I never regret anything"
uh huh
"What advice would I have given well, I guess I could probably change things around me thinking it"
I probably would have had another college major.
"You know, it seems like <Laughter>"
Uh what else around me probably not with certain men <Laughter>um
Waste of time with certain people
I don't know that these are the things that come to mind
Maybe started saving money earlier you know these kinds of things
but
mm
spend a lot of fun with to uh just be a good friend to have people like me for a friend I'm loyally trusting and uh
"I hear I'm a good listener, I'm very patient <laughter> and so"
mhm
"good <Laughter> number one would be to lose weight, but"
"I think this is a worldwide problem, I mean, there's a lot of food around and temptations and"
especially here in America are many of us couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we
you know it's easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you you need to talk yourself into it so
"This is the weight you know will also give you more energy when you lose weight, so that's a big thing than good, but that's probably just the weight thing yeah"
mhm
I think you'd have asked me that question before <Laughter>.
"But if you want, I'll repeat it."
"I'm very uh, like I said, I'm very loyal when I tell people that I'm going to do something that I'm very reliable."
uh
"I'm warm, I'm very friendly, I'm a great listener."
"And I know I've got so many people telling me that they just like with me, like I said I'm very I'm pretty optimistic you know I'm"
I'm not gonna let things get me down too much.
hmm
This is a difficult question <Laughter>
"I can't believe I mean, I'm"
I can't imagine answering that <Laughter> so <Laughter>
for fun good I love movies I could see every movie they make around
I love to go out with my friends
shopping swapmeets around my gosh and travel is great road trips
um
That's kind of
you know
Part of it yes that I mentioned so
Traveling always to see different places the history aspect of him
to enjoy the food food in different countries
uh the architecture
it's just kind of neat to get away and see a completely different place
mhm
Okay well <Laughter> I've been around
to many places in Europe I love paris uh it's such a hiking town you can
"Whoever designed the city, I'm telling you, I mean, you can get from one point to another the subways are great to"
Each area has its own distinctive type of there is the Latin Quarter in which the students are
There is another area where the fashion designers...
"Like our rodeo ride here in beverly hills, there is an area that more Africans <af> Africans and they have swapmeets on weekends that are wonderful for international"
"And then, as I said, when you get out of Paris, there's so much history that you can see the other way around, there are other palaces that you can go to the south of France."
"But this is probably my favorite country, which I was also in Italy."
uh
yes well after college people usually I mean people who go to college or either before or after college
This is a great time to go to Europe because you're young and not tied up you don't have a family and
"You have a more adventurous mind that you have more energy, so you know, carrying backpacks or suitcases isn't a big deal around"
"So yes, that's"
mhm
"Yeah, that's good."
mhm
Thank you.
Goodbye.
