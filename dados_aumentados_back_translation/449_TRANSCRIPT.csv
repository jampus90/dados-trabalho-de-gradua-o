All right.
"Yes, I am."
"I'm good, thank you."
< slaughter>
originally from los angeles and my parents are from Central America
Yes
"the weather around I like that I can come to the water if I want to uh to the hills or hike or just get any element I want to get, I can get"
Traffic <Laughter> busy everyone is always in a hurry to
That's what this is about.
< slaughter>
"if I can have family in Central America and if I try my husband and I,"
Go to warm places like Mexico or somewhere on the Caribbean
"the freedom not to have my daily routine and not to be guilty of not doing something I said I would do when I'm home and when I'm too far away from home to do it, then I have nothing to fear <Laughter>"
"Recently I went back to Honduras, that's where my family came from."
"So it was kind of like a it's a double fold I get to see my family, but I also somehow get to be away from home"
so I do it by not imposing on them I visit them but I stay in a hotel so that somehow I can still have my freedom
"and I don't feel obliged to be with them, so it's more fun this way"
experiences on holiday or
for the most memorable experience
Probably hawaii in lahaina and only with I love eating I'm a foodie so
"to let the pig roast under the ground and just eat it so that I could never taste it as usual, so it's like a memory, it's a deep memory for me, because"
"No matter what I do with my pig, it will never taste like the pig in Lahaina <Laughter>"
"Business and that was years ago, so I ended up in marketing"
So I enjoyed i my business background has helped me in marketing
My dream job
hmm
"Well, I guess it would have to do with food I love to cook"
"and the only reason I hesitate is because I love cooking, but I just do it for home and friends and family"
"if it turns into, if it turns into a job, I feel like it just won't be as happy or I wouldn't have as much fun as I did you know how I've got now"
"but if I could just do it as a job and still have the fun and joy I have in cooking now every day, then that would be my dream job"
I'm going out.
< slaughter>
<Laughter> that's cool <Laughter>
Uh depends on where I am when I'm where I'm actually the first thing I do is just somehow get a grip of myself that I'm always in control no matter where I stand by
and always say that I am my own peace p a p e a c e
So I just take a deep breath to assess my situation.
"find out what I can control, what I can't control and then proceed from there, but just breathe some sort of deep breath and get me under control."
I'm actually very good I'm actually very mild-tempered to start with
I'm not really getting upset.
and so when I just feel hot all the time or when I just react I just like I said I just
"do my own little self-control you know, before I may have kissed, I might have gone for a second, but I'm saying my own little self-control and just you know what comes on no that's mm it's not worth it, this person isn't worth it, the situation is not worth it"
Be who you are and just stay there
actually it was with my husband and we went back and forth about my relationship with my father and I tried to get a point about him and he was just somehow missing my feelings in it
"and I wasn't wanting him to overlook my feelings and act like I didn't feel the way I felt, so I stressed my point in different ways"
"and then I found myself in a debate now and then, when I withdrew and said, no look babe that's how I feel about it I'm not asking you to make me feel different I'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings"
"When I came to my own conclusion, I felt triumphant because"
the point of argument in my mind was to clarify how I didn't feel for him to force his you know he's very a macho somehow male guy I didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic
and so I said no as long as I felt better because I felt undestooded and I felt heard
Let's see.
I can come to my son's mind that he's twenty-two years old.
"And he's got a very alienated relationship right now and it's okay, I'm okay with it."
"He used to be a little more needy, so he thought I'd always look for xxx or call him."
unlike waiting for him to call me
and I think
"It may be a very strange answer, but I wish I was his mother early in my life, which I would have somehow adapted so that he wouldn't wait so comfortably for me to be the one who comes"
"And look for him, he doesn't live with me, he has his own place."
"But waiting for me to be the one looking for him, and you know you're trying to make sure he's okay, I think that's probably much more ethereal than you meant, but"
"I would have done it differently, I would have mothered him differently on the way and released him at an earlier age, which means that I would have treated him more from an adult."
"And then he doesn't expect him to just somehow know you,"
I would have killed the expectation in him that I would contour him if that made sense.
"woo < laughter> no it's not easy, you have to sacrifice and about just physical things you just need to make sure that your child's needs are in front of your own and"
"I guess the second part of this answer is that it's easy once you realize that as long as they're okay, you're okay, so"
"My son, my daughter, they both know that I love them unconditionally."
so
"my upbringing has become easier the more I have lived in this truth, where I expect nothing from them, but then expect no disrespect."
"as long as we have this clear line of communication, whatever still happens, falls under this category of respect"
"see them, maybe make decisions I wish they wouldn't uh it could be as easy as an outfit <Laughter> You know, choice or as much as a career change"
"But I have to sit back and watch them listen, be open and then just"
"somehow just be there you know if they want to talk about it, but then also try not to manage it because I was also her age and I must remember that"
"I didn't want to be managed and even if I made a mistake, I didn't want to be judged, so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on my own"
"and just kind of just waiting around and luckily it's nothing important with my kids, but"
Whatever this personal downfall is just kind of being there and not one I told you I told you so about ghost on me
"It fills the knowledge that you know I created the one you know I planned my two kids, so it's just a real one."
"It's an honor that I could do it, it's an honor that they're healthy."
And it's fun to see them grow up to their own.
"and it's like they're mini me's, but then they're different than I am and so it's just fun"
"be able to allow them who they are and just celebrate as they are, so I enjoy the"
wow completely my parents immigrated here from Central America in the sixties around I was born in the year after they arrived here
so their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the American lifestyle anyway which wasn't a bad thing
It's just that their upbringing style was more about making sure we have a home to make sure
uh we had the accommodation of course and food and clothing and schooling
but there wasn't really much time for my mother's relationship with my daughter as a daughter or my father's relationship with me as a daughter
So I had to figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent.
"I wanted to divorce my first husband because I would be the one who overthrew the whole situation... he was a good father, just not a good husband for me."
"And after twenty years, I knew that I was going to be the one who said it wasn't working for me anymore."
and
"Since I did that the domino effect was <ha>, it wasn't virtual, it happened <laughter> We sold our house, you know, split up the assets and then live apart and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while"
"And then I made some decisions where I didn't want to go through so much trouble, so I just..."
"has a tina Turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else, so it was just a very hard decision by"
"how it affected my children, that's all I care about losing everything"
physical and and and all the material that might be less important to me
"But it was hard because I knew it would affect my children, and they were the only thing that worried me."
Uh my husband and I didn't know you saw eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he I didn't feel validated as a woman or as a woman and that's just who I am and those were the areas that
"He didn't confirm me because he somehow saw me as a partner who financed his extracurriculars, whether it was just traveling or whatever the case, I'm not here to talk about it."
Whatever he did was outside of you that you know the sanctity of our house.
"and I was tired of just you know work and and and he benefits from everything, but then not fulfilled as a woman or a woman and he wasn't ready to change xxx despite all the advice we went through"
and I thought well that this didn't work for me and I had to take care of myself first and I had low self-esteem i you know I wasn't perfect I had a lot of things going on with myself and I had to learn how to love me
to love my children and then to get the love I should get in return.
< slaughter>
You know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day I just know you're good bad ugly or no matter what mistake I made that day or whatever great thing went on that day
"my goal in life is to just rest, so when I have my head in the night"
"I'm just wondering if you knew I did something that I was ashamed of, that I ran over someone today."
"have I not known, and I am not holy or acting as if I am Pollyanna, but I believe in karma"
"I'm a God-fearing woman, so I just want to make sure I've done everything I should do today."
"And if there's something I can correct, you know, I'll just do it one point to promise me,"
go back and correct it or at least learn from it and just don't make the same mistake on another day
"really good light, you know, had some rough spots with the family individually as I said with my son"
"My daughter is a teenager, so somehow she comes into her own, so that's another relationship she's against me, I'm actually very looser, very Bohemian style, she's very social you know, just out there, so somehow I need to find our balance"
but overall it's just I won't complain I'm very happy for a very simple lifestyle
that I'm just kind of on my own care every day and I just enjoy my little
"Mini services, whether someone sees them or not"
< slaughter>
"No, I didn't thank God."
no
really happy let's see
It's at home and I think it was when
Wow
<mumble> different things that run around my mind
I think when my daughter and I got my teenage daughter and I got to understand <underst> anyway understanding on
"Our mother-daughter relationship I'm not trying to be her best friend, but that doesn't mean she can't talk to me."
and I think when she came to me the other day and gave me a big hug from behind me
"without really saying something that I really felt, how she accepted herself"
"and she accepted the fact that I accept who she is, how she is, so it was a very"
"Only she and I knew about it, but there was only one luck that nothing else could ever give me."
< slaughter>
Thank you.
"I'm reckless, I'm just very funny."
"You know, to any chameleon comes to mind, I just kind of acquislimate what kind of situation I'm in I'm very honest I'm very real and only you know, brave when I have to be"
I'm just very grown up I'm a grown woman and you know they'd just describe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that they're on extremely reliable I do as I say what I do
And all I know is that I don't know.
I don't care about b s < laughter>
What could I change about myself?
Uh probably cosmetic things maybe I would just uh that's not even true let me think what are some things that I would change about myself
"Uh, sounds weird that I wouldn't say much about anything really"
I think I'd be easy
"a little more conscious of others I think I'm one I'm super sensitive to others, but I think I'd just be more conscious"
"Make sure I'm not selfish or I'm not tuning someone out just because I want to get through my yoga or I want to do something else, I think I'd just be more attentive and aware of those around me to make sure I don't insult someone"
"I have no regret that I think all the time and you know it's natural to go back and say if I have in this situation with the mindset I now what I would do, but the reality is that I know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me"
"So I don't know, take advantage of it very well and then turn around and call it a regret"
"Because I know I've learned from it, it probably sounds very textbook, but that's true, it's just how I live, so I think that"
"everything that happened well bad ugly or indifferent, for a reason I really believe that and my job is to take away from it"
"what I should take from him and take that into my future, so I'm going to take that you know, the hard knocks with the joys"
hmm
"Be really with myself, this is one thing that took me twenty years to get somehow just to be kind of honest with me to hug who I am"
to learn who I am uh learn my own infrastructure
Be content with the innate things that are part of me.
Do not try <re> to revamp
Don't try to renovate me or try to become something I'm not
Uh I would still have chosen the same marketing career to still I would still have climbed the same company leaders
"But I would have done it from an inner place, not that I would have lost myself in it."
but if in relation to my family life I would simply have been more faithful to myself and so I would have had no kind of resentment
"my family my uh my role as wife my role as mother I think that ultimately that's where my most important fulfillment comes from, because no matter what"
"At the end of this life, this life is this body in this leased vehicle."
that I'm in around everything I'm going to do or all I'm going to be is an epitaph <Laughter> somewhere in a cement chamber
Scrubbed_entry
and I'm always just
"true to that I mean, I was always faithful to that from the time I was eighteen and realized, I wanted to be married and have a family and children and all that"
I think that ultimately that's where my true fulfillment comes from
< slaughter>
Cool
Thank you.
See you.
