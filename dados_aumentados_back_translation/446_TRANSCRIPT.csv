mhm
Transport
The Smog

It just got really crowded
"I wouldn't say much, but I'm trying to"
Travel
Not less than
once or twice every two years
um
simply explore different things and be able to
have different experiences around
Things of this nature and you know it
Learning new things and
only different cultures uh I like to learn about different cultures and when you travel
You get a feeling of
um
"You know feedback from different cultures and different areas, so I like that"
"Well, I just came from miami uh last year I went to miami for a week and a half"
and it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time
around and around the weather was wonderful people are really nice
It was really a great experience I went out there for.

"Well, from this trip, I'd say, um..."
Swimming in the beautiful

"Yeah, that's it."
Development of children
mhm
"Well, um..."
I've always been interested in children since I was younger.
"um i babysat a lot, so I had a lot of experience with children at a young age"
"and when I got older, I realized it was something I liked to do"
That's why I'm here.
That's when I looked around in children's development classes.
And I thought it was something like I'd enjoy it
"I started taking classes, and the rest is history."
"I am, it's..."
15 years in August
"Yeah, that's good."
My dream job
I'd say...
becoming a principal
"Well, it's something I've been thinking about for a while, and..."
I just started the steps to get this going.
So I'll be back in school and I'll take classes
So I can do this.
because it's a dream of mine yeah thank you
It will be quite difficult. There are several years of schooling that I have ahead of me.
"And you know it's definitely going to be a challenge, but it's something I'm ready for because it's a dream job of mine."
"So it's something I'm ready to do,"
I'm ready to do
um
a little of both I think a little of both I can sometimes be shy about
and and also starting from
but I think a little of both I'd say
< slaughter>
I'm meditating.
"I'm a big big meditator, so I love meditating"
I just love to read and just have nice quiet peaceful time
Oh wow I'm very good at it
very good in controlling my temperament i around
Let's do it again.
a series of
Meditation I Do
it involves deep breathing and around
just really center yourself
until you can feel your heart beat and you can
to really feel everything in your body
and it really really allows you to relieve stress and control fear and anger
and things of this nature that helps me very much
Oh wow
It was just about actually unfortunately
It was last week and it was with my husband
and
It was about
how he sometimes reacts to me
Uh it can be a little aggressive
We're just trying to work with it because I don't respond well to aggression.
"I'm totally singing out, and that's actually what happened, so..."
"Yeah, that's it."
I felt
very frustrated
"Um, and I actually felt upset about"
but frustrated and I also felt sad because I don't like fighting like this
it was a little bit of all these emotions at once
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
a situation I wish I had treated differently
"To be honest, I haven't had a situation like this yet."
in the years I have quite a lot of kind of
um
"You know, somehow mastered"
my answers
to a certain extent
Irritation
I kind of managed to do this.
the hardest decision I've ever had to make
it was good when I was sixteen years old and I became a teenager
For Mother
I was pregnant when I was 16 and
"Um, I had..."
A lot of pressure from the family to...
give up my child for adoption or
To Cancel
and I chose life so that was
"That was one of the toughest decisions, if not the toughest decisions you should make when you're a 16-year-old."
"Teenager to teenager, whether I wanted to continue to be a child and a teenager"
Or if I wanted to raise a life when I was a child myself.
that I think was the hardest decision
I had to do it
um
"Well, I mean around my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later"
and I'm really so glad it was one of the best things I've ever done.
do not choose to cancel it and choose <choo> Pro-life
pro-choice pro-life and
I didn't regret the decision. It's my only child.
I love him he's just a blessing he's just a blessing and I feel very special about being his mother
I know.
"No, it's not easy, it's definitely in trouble."
"Um, just like everything else."
um
but at the end of the day it's really rewarding
um
and you'll just see the life that you've brought into the world and that you've raised
become a productive citizen and go into society and
easy to make their way and it's really rewarding it's really
Oh wow
so many ways around
the first way <wa> uh the first way I really listen to my son and I
accepts his feedback even if I don't like it
and I allow him to express his self
"Luckily, unfortunately, when I was little to"
There wasn't much conversation between parents and children
It was more like we were just told that you know what to do and we did it.
Um and with my son I give him options I allow him to express his self
"I allow him to give me feedback to give me negative or positive, because I feel that it is really important for a child to develop her voice at a young age."
and around as parents you have to be supportive and that and somehow around
"Make sure you feed this, because this is"
Type of
"the way they develop, you know, and it's really important, so"
I am different in order in many ways in this rite
Thank you.
To <sigh>
All right.
"it sometimes depends on it, it depends on the time I go to sleep, it depends on the time I woke up."
So it's a lot of factors around I can't just give you an answer around I'd say that
It varies sometimes I can go to sleep and fall asleep immediately
"and other times I can go to sleep and it could take a while to actually fall asleep, so"
it varies
"I've been feeling great lately, I was really..."
"I can't say that, like I said last week, it didn't affect me, um, you know the fight with my husband, but..."
different than that I felt really good
"No, I didn't."
No I didn't
You know what honest I feel happy every day you know every day I wake up
I'm happy because
"this is a chance for me,"
use carpe diem grab the day
"I feel blessed every morning, I wake up, it's a blessing you know, because"
I know some people didn't wake up.
Some people are homeless
go through so many situations that are really daunting
And I'm not like that
I really feel blessed
every day
Thank you.
In order to:
Care of patients lovingly
friendly
um
Type of reserved
um
"Well, I wish I'd already graduated from college and had my master's degree"
and sometimes I wish I was a little more knowledgeable
in certain subjects
"And I can change if I can change everything, I would change that these two things"
and also I would be a little more starting and less from an introvert
"You know what's no regret, no regret."
You live and learn for nothing is perfect
Everything I've been through has made me the person I am today.
So I wouldn't change anything because I'm happy with the person I'm today
oh <sigh> man stay in school to stay in school and
get your training and put that first and foremost before a relationship
"Even before your career, I really would have told myself."
to stay focused and
get a great education
I'm very proud of...
where I came from
as a teenage mother
To be a statistic and actually change that
on my same I've been doing my uh same job for fifteen years now I'm really proud of it
"I've been married for thirteen years, I'm really proud that happily married"
"To my best friend and soul mate nothing is perfect, but"
he's my best friend and I love him and I'm also proud of
My son is the mother I am and the son I raised.
"I'm proud of the job I did, and I'm..."
I really applaud myself for it
you're welcome you were wonderful thank you
Goodbye.
