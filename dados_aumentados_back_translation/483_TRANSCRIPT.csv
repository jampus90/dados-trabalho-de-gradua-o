It's just another place
It's bike friendly.
Louisiana is not
New Orleans for this matter is really not
"Now they're trying to be, but it's just not so successful"
The drivers are crazy.
"mm not really somehow, but not much more"
Didn't you break the money somehow <Laughter>

"Um, and that was pretty funny."

Travel or just in general
hmm
um
I have to say:
"I have to say, we were"
We were on our way out to
we had
from the p_c_h and goes into
Leguna
and laguna has this really steep hill and on Sunday it is full of traffic
and I remember going down
the hill and my brakes didn't work and I tried to hit my brakes and try to hit my brakes and they just wouldn't click
and I was like oh god
"and I'm on a tricycle bike, so I'm taller than most bikes and I'm like circling between like grid lock traffic"
going down a hill
Non-brakeable
And I'm going down
And suddenly
"There is this car that is directly in mm veers essentially where I try to go, so i"
Rotate
strong
before this bus and this truck and literally at the end go sideways through the traffic through incoming traffic
"and then loop <Laughter> back into the right traffic through incoming traffic, still without brakes"
and how not to keep my bike from
Rolling that's painful when your bike rolling somehow hurts a lot
So yes.
"Yeah, that's it."
< slaughter>
um
various things uh anthropology visual effects
"Kind of weird, but yes."
um
I always had a fascination for film
and
I think the way people do things and do things is fascinating.
just like the mob mentality of the people
Special
"Oh, dream job"
um
What are you doing?
I have no idea.
"just one job, I guess"
I see myself as an outbound
um
"You know, I've never been afraid of what people think of me."
like people xxx i I like people I don't know
I'm not
I'm not afraid of what they think
I'm more worried like the people I know and what they think of me.
I guess being out like that is just not really
Influence me

<Sigh>
uh
"In high school, I pushed someone's head through a locker."
um
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's not good, never push anyone's head into a locker."
This is a good way to be suspended
um
I don't know.
Yes things like this only

<Sigh>
um
like a serious argument
To <sigh>
uh
I guess how
xxx
Argument about
About
um
Uh I think about how uh like views on how weapons control
and arms control laws
"I mean,"
It was like
Last night
"Oh, that's it."
It was an argument that you know gun control scheme I mean it doesn't really affect me personally
but that was like the last argument I came into
"That's kind of what you said, I think."
ooh
um
All my life...
<laughs> uh <mumbling> <sigh>
I've been
um
on
Two years ago I broke up
with how everyone calls her my evil ex
and
"Yeah, it was just so bad that the whole thing went wrong, I mean,"
uh
eh
I think I've calmed down a lot since then.
like a person as a whole
"But I mean, I was angry and so I think that I like on my bike for like"
Hundreds of miles more in a unique day
and I was in a ton of pain
For example:
later in the evening I came home I was like oh god
It's like I can barely walk.
"and yes, I think I'm running away and"
"as on a like extreme cycling Spree was not good, but it was better than how"
too much food and like
only
Overeating because I was depressed
"but yes how we fought and shouted and it was not good as if I did not fight physically, it was more like a screaming match of death"

um
I don't think I had a unique hard decision.
I've ever had to do
because
My biggest thing
in life
You don't know you don't regret it.
I don't regret it.
the things you do
"I just regret the opportunities you missed, and that's like you had to come with me."
That was how I had to learn that in the past like two years
"like two years ago, I just couldn't understand this concept"
and to answer your question
I'm thinking about thinking
the hardest decision I had to make
is
I'd say:
likely
likely to break with my ex probably
um
xxx <sigh> ooh
around <sigh> where do I start
<Sigh>
um
my ex was not a good person just in any form or form of the word
She did a few things I didn't feel quite comfortable with.
only to the people around them and to me
and
i
< Deep breath>
<Laughter> You know
They say you should forgive people.
to do for mistakes or things
and I just think there are some things that people can't forgive.
No matter how hard you try
and I think there are some things that are done once
that it can't be
andone they're just they're the way they're
and I think
I'm thinking about what she did.
I just like xxx
eh
Things just fall apart after it's just us
mm despite us try
It just didn't work.
"I mean,"
I don't know that I don't really want to talk about exactly what happened.
"Oh, God, what are you doing?"
"Oh, man."
to delete from my memory or just to delete from ever happen
um
"I don't know, you know that's hard."
um
Katrina
only the experience of Katrina for the beginning
~ My ex ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
"I guess it's kind of tough between the two of them, I'd rather lean towards Katrina."
'Cause that was just that it wasn't
"I mean, I guess you don't know exactly, but..."
in two thousand five around
Uh this huge storm hit
uh
New Orleans louisiana to kill a whole bunch of people
levelled the city
um
and
I lost a lot of friends during the storm
um
"I mean, I kind of get over it"
but
It's still
It's still there.
and I think
"I don't know, I mean"
You can try and look you can try your best and find something positive
But nothing is the only thing.
what you can do
is <i>
Just think it was like a freak accident and it's never gonna happen again
but <Laughter> I live in l_a and you know
<Laughter> Earthquake
"<Laughter> they could happen <Laughter> and I just think, oh I'd rather"
Do you rather know it's coming than not knowing it's coming?
Yes
<Laughter> yeah
<sigh> um
mm depression repeats several times
It's not a surprise.
The first time I was diagnosed was in middle school.
- That would be...
<sigh> ten a good twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years
I don't know xxx
"I don't know when I was in sixth grade, that's"
It's when the first time I was told I was depressed
um
as far as p_t_s_d goes
to go to Katrina
um
and then
you know
I'm just...
post katrina mostly < laughter> that was the big deal
um
I guess that had been previously diagnosed as being depressed and still in high school
"It was kind of not that I wasn't really looking for help, it's kind of that I was kind of coming to my high school."
And they were like here's help because we know you're gonna need it
"Um, and I was like oh good, thanks for not really asking for it, but okay, I'll take it."
um
you know
It just happened somehow.
no not not anymore
um
eh
<Sigh>
<Laughter> that's a good question about <Laughter>
You know I really don't know.
"I guess it kind of stopped, just kind of was how good I'm not gonna do that anymore"
sometimes
Sometimes it's the way you feel today.
And so and so
you know
"It's kind of good, I feel good right now, but"
Ask me in two hours and who knows
you know
um
<Sigh>
I guess...
It has helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen
and just keep walking and moving with your life
um
mm essentially only
mm how to continue you know
Things will go on
<Sigh>
um
Wow <Laughter> around
"Um, I was..."
I was hanging out with my girlfriend.
hanging out
um
good for the beginning I mean
You can't
I just went for a walk with a stick because I was recently hit by a car.
And I'd make my leg better
um
"Let's see, the stick's over there."
in this way but still around <sigh>
I don't know.
Uh make me less fat
< slaughter>
um
I would make it so that I would not feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day.
"Because if you sleep more than ten hours a day, it's just unproductive that you're wasting too much time."
how I have friends who like oh you know I feel rejuvenated after six hours and I'm like you do
I need to sleep like 12 hours to feel good.
how you can sleep six
you know
as in in Crunch time you know that you're with four I have to go with
Seven
or eight
you know
For example:
This is my Crunch Time Sleep plan eight hours
It's just
"I don't know, I'm sleeping, but I like sleeping, too."
"I mean,"
"Yeah, it's just the sleepy part I don't like."
um
<Sigh>
um
completely crazy in a good way
completely crazy in a good way
um
"Uh, I guess,"
how they would also
say how you know
There are times when I could seem like an asshole and I'm not really an asshole I'm just
you know
I'm just having problems like everyone else.
"In particular, I have"
Asperger is a kind of autism.
That makes life simply fantastic
You'd also say I'm extravagant and eccentric
'Cause it's totally me
I just...
I don't know.
"I think I'm still alive, so I should live because I'm still alive"
And you know
Who knows how long I'll be alive
So I should know
live while I live and only
Go out and do things and not
do not sit and be calm
except when I read
and I like to read
<Sigh>
um
"Stop fucking with me, no, it's kind of messed up."
um
I think
I would have told myself then.
um
Because I knew.
my evil ex
I've known her since I was six and she was five.
"I think ten years ago, I would have grabbed my shoulders and said that you see this girl, whatever you do if you're not with the girl."
Don't trust her that she can't be trusted.
And more importantly:
don't
"Don't leave your guard around her, because she'll exploit it."
and I mean how physically don't leave your guard mentally
um
yeah don't date here just don't do it's not worth it < laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain
It's not worth it.
The fact that I'm still alive
Maybe
"Yeah, that's good."
Uh I don't know cycling to comic con I was pretty proud of this pretty proud that I managed to do it
um
only
"I don't know, I don't really know that I don't really use the term pride."
I don't feel really proud.
I'm just it's more like the fact that I'm still alive I'm proud to be alive <Laughter>
I don't know if that makes me humble or just crazy
Who knows?
I now press the button
Goodbye.
All right.
