I'm out of los angeles california

um
I don't know that there aren't too many things I might not like about l_a.
some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in l_a
< slaughter>
not too much
I was just like texas las vegas and
That's pretty much all.
mhm
um
Catching a plane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my father
and
go to read vegas a lot
This is
"Oh, yeah, good."
"When I was younger, I went to my father and because he lived in Houston texas and I often caught the plane"
And that was a lot of fun I wasn't afraid that was a lot of fun
and I enjoyed that <Laughter>
"When I went to school, I studied child development and nursing."
um
"I know I wanted to be someone, and when I went to school, I wasn't sure what I wanted to be."
So I first maintained the l_v_n program.
"and then I didn't want to be a nurse, so I changed my main subject to child development and I graduated."
"No, I'm actually looking for work. I'm unemployed right now."
my dream job would be
probably work with the children who open a nursery or something that is my own business
"in my head it's simple, but as in reality it seems like it's kind of difficult <Laughter>"
"sometimes I'm shy, but I'm really an outgoing person and a human person"
hmm
< slaughter>
"To relax, I listen to slow music that I kind of like."

and maybe lie down a little t_v or something
I'm very good at controlling my temperament
I don't like getting really angry or angry
or
come to the place where
I'm fit to hurt someone <Laughter>
um
if I really have arguments that they are because people don't agree to contradict.
And then it's over how really petty it is like
"We could say oh, it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion, so we're arguing about it, but there's nothing really big or something like that that it's just stupid, I don't even remember <Laughter>"
um
I need a job <Laughter>
Yes
um
Maybe <sigh>
I don't really remember a situation I'm trying to really think about before I really do a situation and I'm trying to handle it in my best positive way
before I really do something I regret
To be with someone like a guy you know when I want to continue a relationship with them.
or just
To be single
mm
um
my relationship with my family that I don't have
I just stay with my dad and I have a daughter
"And we just stay close to my whole family, they're either in..."
Houston texas
or
"They're close, but I'm not joining many of my family."
My father
"Because I'm living with him right now, I might have lived with him for five to six years."
and
"he's just the only one I really look up to, I don't really have anyone around me to look up to, and"
That's it <Laughter>
Scrubbed_entry
"She's in fifth grade, she's graduating, she's in sixth grade, and I'm kind of excited about it."
"sometimes it's easy, but uh sometimes it gets a little overwhelming"
The hardest part about being a parent is being a single parent.
"It's just that you always have someone who brings you joy, I always enjoy things to do with my daughter"
It's all about making a lot of sacrifices and just always
It brings me so much joy to be a parent
All right.
to my parents when I was younger
they
"lived apart, so my mother"
"I don't know that I'm a much better parent because I'm more interested in what my child wants to do, I'm involved in her life"
they only take every step
I'm really fully involved my parents wasn't really that you know they had a drug problem
So it's easy
I had to mature much faster than many other children
so
It was
um
only
My parents and...
her drug addiction I wish I could erase this from my memory
To cope with them now
"Well, when I grew up, it was just rough, it was very rough."
had to do a lot of things on your own
They weren't involved in my choices in life.
I didn't know how I really grew up and be a child and what way to go or anything it was easy as if I was alone in a world
"Yeah, that's good."
Oh it's very easy I sleep well every night I can sleep whenever I sleep very well
um
a little sad but most of the time I'm very happy I'm just not happy with where I'm in my life right now
um
not really I really try to think very positively and try what I can do every day to look for work and
Just stay positive and focused
"No, I didn't."
"No, I didn't."
"The last time I felt very happy was when I finished college, I felt very happy that this was one of the best things that happened in my life and"
That was the last time I was really very happy.
I felt like I was on top of the world I felt like
only
Overwhelmed by Joy Only
everything was just so exciting for me that day I was just very happy nothing could upset me that day I was very happy and when I think about that day it just
it's a very happy experience for me
um
"Right now, I don't really have a best friend."
"I'm really trying, I'm"
"I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they didn't really make a lot of positive decisions, so right now I'm just like"

"and I tried to really be her friend, no matter the illness she had"

um
to be very negative and just to talk about me as if we were enemies and everything and
"It didn't really feel bad about me, but it just made me choose my friends very smart"
yeah just friends with certain people who don't have positive things with themselves or just
"not only when I notice things about people who should determine whether I want to be their friend or not, you know that maybe she"
bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and I should notice that this is a red flag and I shouldn't be this one
Friends <Laughter>
