"More setback uh out here it's you know you have the weather, that's the prominent <pr> prominent reason for coming is the weather"
it does uh good maybe better chances
uh and the weather <Laughter>
Yes
It took one minute uh to get to <tisk> the uh
different attitudes of the people
the environment
the locations and the
Wide area that someone had to cover to get to one place
um
All right.
the weather uh for one that never end uh uh it never snows in Southern California
Umm two uh
the prospects of uh uh starting a business or becoming uh
Self-employed and self-employed
do what I like to do
the people
they're not friendly for no one friendly out here you know uh back east and I'm from uh I was raised in the south
where everyone is uh warm friendly hello when you pass in the streets out here
People think that you uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing
so
I don't like that about l_a.
Previous uh I was on the road a lot I was a truck driver and plus uh an entertainment uh bus driver for several
Uh Motown bands back in the day so yeah so I'm used to traveling yes yes yes
"Well, that's a beautiful land, so it's just a beautiful land."
See uh uh the landscape uh visit different cities different cultures
uh different cities uh and see how
basically like the rest of the country uh uh uh lives
a few not so good a few bad uh and a few good uh times see
Denver colorado
I lived in Denver for a few years that uh really is a great uh
City
uh
"and then I lived in uh atlanta, which is uh uh really a great state where you know that you have the southern attitude <a> a southern attitude southern attitude"
that is friendly to everyone and comes out and
and
Let's see.
I was at least back and forth in this country.
16 to 20 times
"Yeah, it was like it was an adventure."
< slaughter>
Uh Arkansas
Small stone
where I had to get into a uh
You could say a dispute
"with the hounds down there because, as you know,"
I'm African American
"And down there, they're very biased that you know they're the..."
Southern
uh
"what the rebels were uh no rebels, but uh"
"What were they, uh Confederates, they still have this tendency to think blacks?"
or any other culture except white are not uh
valuable people
"Yeah, so I had an incident down there where it actually turned into a shootout."
But I'm fine.
a little of both depends on the time
on the time it depends on what mood I'm in at the time you know
I can go because I like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and
I know how I said I uh I had some conversation before so
at clubs I am more outgoing
shyer in social events
< slaughter>
meditate
Very good
"very good, because"
"If I let my temper get the best of me, I tend to"
Cause more
Damage
as good
You know that the person harms me by
"You know, uh"
Physical conflicts or to go to prison
"and so yes, I'm very good in uh"
Control my feelings
My temperament
Good question
uh
Okay girlfriend <Laughter> uh
We recently split up about two three weeks ago.
because of a dispute about what she thought she could do and what I know she couldn't do
And she still wanted to do it like this
uh that led to a dispute and the argument ended up in us so yeah
It was emotional uh
but
I'm fifty-five and it's not my first break-up so
I'll just take it in step and move on
uh
"Well, it's probably that it"
No one can really be no situation
I feel at the time when you when you are having a situation at any given time there is probably always a better way to handle it
after the fact
But...
"I'd say back in the 1980s, when I and my wife broke up."
"I think I could have done better because I was younger, hot tempered."
and more irrational so that I could have treated you better yes
what the way I broke the way I treated this situation
well as I said uh young and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and
uh
unable to communicate
with another person at the level of
of
Understanding
< slaughter>
hmm
Leaving Home
"Well, it was like"
<Sigh>
What can I say?
It was about
one o'clock two o'clock in the morning
and I've just decided to pack and go without letting anyone know that I'm going
It was like one of the toughest decisions I had to make
sketching
loving but sketchy uh
my family is in detroit and atlanta georgia
I'm in California
"I don't have anybody out here, so..."
I'm basically on my own and I've been on my own for a long time.
We're reconciled.
and we talk and send
Christmas cards Thanksgiving cards you know and in this factor but uh as far as uh
Family it is
It's
It's sketchy.
None
hm
uh
I don't know.
most things I don't want to remember I don't like and I've deleted
many things from my memory or
I put it in a closet that I can't open to remember.
But most of what I can say is uh uh
"I'm not going to go into detail, but an incident where"
it caused great physical damage to a person
in the last two weeks uh with which I had uh
"This Hearburn problem, so it's been really difficult in the last two weeks."
for me to get uh
"a little sleep, because I have one in my pocket, now I have a glass of tums"
It keeps me pretty stunned right now
Irritable
um
Scary
um
need to do things
uh
and
I feel like I have people.
and things that
against me and try to block everything I do to be successful and that was a big disturbance for me
"Yeah, but you know, like I said, I'll take everything with a grain of salt."
"And I keep pushing, because"
You can't stay angry.
"or vengeful to a person or a thing too long because it achieves nothing, so I must push further"
"No, basically I'm still the same"
just keep my thoughts <th> uh I keep my ideas that I have to do
uh and try to achieve uh uh what I need to achieve uh uh
post mm traumatic load

"Um, um..."
mental health uh institution
for treatment
"From time to time, if I feel depressed and fear builds up in me uh yes, I still have treatment"
"Yes, because I have the chance to express some of the things that"
I don't usually express
and I can like
Blow off steam or uh
Blow off
The Fear Part of Uh My Depression

"Well, I was really very happy when"

To be together for us
I was really happy
"and then it turned within two weeks, but at that time"
"When that happened, I was really happy"
