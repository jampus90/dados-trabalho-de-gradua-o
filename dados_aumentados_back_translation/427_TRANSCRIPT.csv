"I'm good, how are you?"
I originally came from Florida.

Where are you from?
"Oh, uh,"
for work < slaughter>
I haven't been back in a couple of months.
um
"I don't know, I guess it's like a smaller town than here."
It was pretty easy
It's...
it's not such a big difference unless I guess the buildings are bigger <Laughter>
I like the weather
and
I like the environment of how
Hollywood I guess <Laughter>
I hate the transport <transporta> the transport system
and the traffic is really bad <Laughter>
mhm
"Yes, I've travelled a lot through America"
I like to see new places and meet new people from different areas and so on.
and
I guess it's just relaxing and it's fun < laughter>
I used to go to Canada.
"Mom has a girlfriend up there, so we went to see her there."
It's pretty cold <Laughter>
I didn't like that.
on this special journey
or
um
I don't know her.

I think it's poutine or something.
So I guess that was a new experience.
um
"I'm trying to go to the sun, like going to the beach or something like that."
or read a book
"Uh, pretty."
Okay [Laughter]
depends on how bad the situation is
um
I don't know how two days ago
I was arguing with my sister about something.
Oh yeah <Laughter> I really don't remember anything
"Stupid, I think she"
I don't know that she borrowed something from me and she didn't return it in time <Laughter>
um
"I don't know, I guess"
"I mean, I wish I didn't lose my temper so fast."
sometimes
but this doesn't happen so often
um
"I don't know, I think thinking more before I talk"
then maybe I won't lose my temper <Laughter>
um
I wish I could erase it from my memory.
"I don't know, I just guess"
like uh negative people
or something negative I've met before
I guess I just want to delete
the thought of meeting them
All right.
had like friends who just like
not very good company and
They're just very
not very good influences so
"Yeah, I'd just want to delete them, but I'm not friends with them anymore, so..."
um
my
Who is a positive influence
my family is a positive influence <Laughter>
and my friends now
"Oh, it's pretty good."
i
"talk to them a lot, I see them a lot"
so
"Yeah, that's good."

"It's not that hard, but <Laughter> it's a little bit"
It's a
Big decision

"not so much, but a little"
"Well, I got it when I came into it when I was a teenager so"
I guess I'm just...
"and I was good at it, so I just thought,"
I'd continue to study it.
for higher at a higher level
"Yeah, a little bit, but I..."
"uh, somehow I wanted to"
I tried to make a decision between that and the arts.
so
"Yeah, I'm just glad I did."

"Yeah, that's good."
how hard work is
um
I don't think it's a hard job <Laughter> I like clothes and
Tissues and
Making such clothes so I don't think it's a hard job

depending on how tired I am
I am very irritable <Laughter> and
uh
"Yes, I'm very irritable and"
not good to be near <Laughter> when I am tired
And I can't concentrate
I felt good.

What else is it?
I don't know and I wish I was like I don't think about
not easy to get around
Anger like
You got a temper or something.
"Oh, no, it's not in trouble, it's just"
Sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people
♪ I'm getting a temper ♪
but I have never got into trouble or
mm

um
"I can't think <laughter>, um, I guess,"
I was in
I was once in an elevator and this person
as if they were running towards him
and
as if I had tried to think it was her
but I couldn't reach it in time and they liked to start cursing me like I really felt bad because they probably thought I wouldn't try to open it for them
but
"Yeah, that's good."
It was that <Laughter>
um
Everything I regret I don't really I do well yes I regret about
