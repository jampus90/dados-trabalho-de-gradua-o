New York
I moved to Ia in the seventies.
"but I did, but I lived a lot of different places"
of
um
"I guess every few years, but"
"I travel a lot, so I lived in"
"I lived in Africa, I also lived in Spain Switzerland hong Kong."
around different cultures food music rituals
uh
everything that smells the colors
makes you feel alive
Excuse me.
one of my travels
Uh I lived in Kenya for about a year around I'd say
I love riding like this when you are
uh other animals see when you are
Type of disguised in the scent of a horse you can get the animals much closer so around it was great
see red orange autumn sunsets and
"Ride along, you know uh"
so many animals see yeah
in Kenya
Probably when I went to a
a masai village and I happened to live in hawaii
"and I was on tahiti, and I was wearing one of those pareos, which are handpainted, and I had it"
tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and I happened to
Entering a Masai village for the first time
uh that day and I looked around everywhere and the men wore their clothes exactly the same
turn <Laughter> on the same shoulder and they came to me and they said why are you masai dressed
and uh <Laughter> and around then they came back and gave me what seemed to be
uh
"some very large, which looked like pearl leather bookmarks, but they were actually earrings, so they weighed like"
my ears straight down and then they gave me some bracelets
And then they uh I had to wear something around my waist and they said now you really see masai <Laughter> so but I just I have a lot of uh I think live
get a chance to live in different countries around the world I just got uh you feel alive all your senses are totally you know uh awakened yes
"I think it's not so clear cut I think a lot of people are a hybrid of both I mean, I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely bold"
"Uh and very brave at other times probably one of my best virtues is that I'm very good-natured person, so if I really feel passionate about something, I risk everything to go"
sometimes to reach I think that
um
usually I do well I make decisions very quickly
and I think I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he told me how to make decisions faster
and I told him I said well in any case
You always have no choice and he says what you mean there is
"Hundreds of decisions and I didn't really say, because it's belly wise just one"
and it's not really important you waste time physical energy emotional energy
"mental energy reflects everything if well wise you always know what the choice is, what you really want to do, and it doesn't matter if there is a ninety eight percent probability of failure"
"Even if it's a two percent chance of success, you have to go to the one that can give you joy, so I always go to the one that it's a waste of total time for me."
"and energy to even think about another choice, because who cares if you stay unharmed, but it if it does not bring joy"
"Uh, excuse me."
You said you'd put your fish
What do I do if I'm angry?
To <sigh>
"<tisk> I think if I'm upset sometimes it's me, because sometimes I can have, I can have a little more patience around"
I guess you really have to sit down for yourself
"in the shoes of another rather than the way you would react, you must have more empathy"
I don't think that's why I'm so happy to travel because you
in other situations where you are forced to
to the
Understanding other people
"lives much more, regardless of how different they are"
uh from your different situations I've been in so many Third World countries and lived in so many different situations that it helps you to create what's why
Traveling is really the best education there is
Let me think.
Last time I argued about it
"A little, uh..."
"God, I'm trying to remember <Laughter> around"
"Oh, I think it was when someone didn't respect my privacy in something"
um
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"Oh, I know what it was."
It was someone who belonged to the uh
Uh Scientology Faith around
- I don't know.
Inherited
"I may have inherited an immune disorder from my mother, my mother died of lupus."
and
Uh I sometimes even at the moment I have rashes and everything and I'm very photosensitive
and
I had a you know an episode where I was I had big torches and I didn't feel really good I felt red and everything and the Scientologist tells me that I had to be audited
and
and he said something about are you aware
past lives and
I had told him that I was a Buddhist and I was kind of curious that
"if you are trying to recruit someone to at least convert to your religion, you should find out the other person which religion they are to be even informed and able to talk to them"
and I and he said that you know that
um
<tisk> about something in your past and I'm going to think that
many religions uh including Buddhists and Scientology believe that things you have have <ha>
had in your story sometimes affect you or things you keep that anger asking bitterness
through your previous relationships or your
"Parents and such can influence and even make you sick you even have cancer, yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe that I said that"
You know that you have the power of each person to go a god like or a Buddha like nature and you can make yourself
"Even if I'm close to being maybe, I'm probably getting a cold."
maybe every fifteen years I have no tendency to be sick at all
and a large part of it is I think when I think I'm on edge
I'll take
"Like I did, even when I was a child when I was seven, I would."
Folding I had my boo boo
and I would take <ta> I would say I would have the good part
"You know, help the bad part <Laughter> out of a simplistic way in relation to a child"
and I would actually
even when I was in a very serious car accident where I was cut by glass my whole back
I concentrated healing and when I went back to the hospital
the doctors actually had the nurses coming and say this is incredible that
"only <jj> she last week her back was cut so hard this is incredibly healing thing, so I think that but uh"
um
"Uh, but I was just, I think, upset and irritated a little, because the Scientologist told me that"
because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he had these certificates on his wall that he felt that he had more enlightened and
It wasn't even one thing I said if it was him.
"whether he took twenty forty courses or whether I practised Buddhism, whether it was for five ten fifteen"
"Twenty years or if someone has been practicing a kind of Christianity for fifty years and is sitting in a church every day, does not mean that this person would have"
never visited the church and more spiritually than someone who has
you know
So I just thought this was the antithesis of
"someone who says they're enlightened, but it's just the way I think he's getting his"
uh
"You know his belief in my neck that after a while I was pretty patient with him, but he was so pompous that I was irritated"
especially when he kept telling me that it was being audited and that the same person needed a hip surgery
the following week
And I didn't show him because I didn't want to.
"into it, but"
"you could say hey you have a bad hip because you need to be tested that something you've done in your past, otherwise you wouldn't need to have a hip surgery I mean, I think to some extent things that can be caused"
from the people themselves
"And then he says flippy good, you're aware Scientologists believe that"
Past life can also be based on
"You know, and I think of myself, Buddhists of all religions are"
"are somehow as well known for you know, believe in a cause and effect and past life situations and I found my thoughts"
he should really read when he tries to convert other people < laughter> from other religions so
But...
"You know, I know it just wasn't me."
You know he cares about the fact that he wouldn't drop it <Laughter>
"But unlike that, I don't mean"
<sigh> um
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"sometimes having a little more beat, I guess when"
when it is in relation to patience
"I can figure this out right away, I guess I'll cut my father off when he was like a vegetable in the hospital."
mm < sigh>
MM my brother
uh should be the strong one supposedly because he
is in the medical field so my sister and I said good
"You know he's the doctor, so he's probably used to seeing this all the time."
but it turned out that he was the weakest and also after
"You know my boss, my father,"
You know.
You know it would make his body crooked.
"Fighting the artificial breathing device and all kinds of things you see, all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was very difficult"
But you know it was after a while the uh
You even know the doctors and even the uh pastor of this particular
"Uh hospital <ho> You know hospital they said that he wouldn't be like any more, even if he'd wake up from that he'd be his brain function, you know, negligible"
"Yeah, it was mhm."
hm
mm
I don't think I really have so many things that are so traumatic.
that happened to me that I
had to block it I really don't know what
"It's in my makeup,"
doesn't make me feel like I don't have to hold like I do I have friends who
have unchecked problems they don't even know
who influence their behavior or perhaps their bitterness or anger or hatred or fear
and for some reason I feel blessed that I
I can't even think of something that
"I mean, I had something"
"Bad situations happen to me, but"
It's not why they traumatized me.
Influence
You know my behavior where I would
"where I block it, that I am not aware"
of something or I think rest
Negativity for some reason
I can't think of anything I mean.
"There are bad things that happen and I know they're there, but it's not like I have the feeling that it's necessary for me,"
To block them because I was able to
You know.
sometimes accept <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that have happened
Pretty easy I can usually sleep my own myself in any situation if I could take a one hour flight to San Francisco I could only
Kind of lean on the window with the pillow have the ceiling over and even on an hour flight out before the plane has even taken out of the ground so
"I can just <j>I literally have when I have had little sleep and I have very uh high energy so I don't really need so much sleep, but"
like I'm in Africa and I'm in Africa
<tisk> bumpy pothole unpaved street and I suddenly saw that I need a few moments of sleep I just requir put up something my
"elbows against the window and say, I think I'm going to take a nap for <Laughter> fifteen minutes so and through the jostling I coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so I don't really have this problem"
"Okay pretty okay I mean, I could flare up without the skin, but you know, from the photo sensitivity and all that, but unlike that, I'm in pretty good Spirts uhh"
have I ever investigated < s> what
"I still couldn't hear you, I'm sorry."
"have I ever studied changes in my behavior, what was the word"
Yes
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
around <sigh> I don't just know with friends and all this
Last week just seeing friends I enjoy being with and just laughing at a great meal just you know a good time listening to music
"Repent my whole life you mean, or you're just talking about it, or what you're talking about"
mm
You know it's funny.
"Uh I find that a lot of negative experiences that have happened in my life, too, have been"
uh
um
Opened up experiences that
they're also great that I'm not
"for example, I was totally torn down by my business partner"
after the melody of all my <wh> all my savings and I had to start over and
Sometimes people sat with me like
"If you're sure you're okay, you're just pretending to be okay, or"
"if you're angry, if I was, you want to seek revenge"
"You know, because my business partner basically ripped me off, we knew each other's families that even"
more difficult in a way around and uh
he basically stole my whole life savings essentially in a way and he was sent to jail and the f_b_i involved was interpol involved
I lived in Switzerland and my father was sick and I went back and forth and around
"But you know, if I hadn't sneaked in, I wouldn't have gotten involved with him."
I would not have had the many rich experiences and I sometimes think the reason why
"I don't know why I'm such a positive person, but for some reason I'm able, it's not that I'm deliberately trying to see"
the positivity in even terrible situations that I would not have gotten
to live in barcelona and I would not have learned to speak Spanish so well <g>
German
Uh lived in Europe if I didn't participate in business with my business partner who ended up tearing me apart
but and there are many other experiences and different friendships that I develop
during this time and in some way it was a completely different life
uh
another world that
that you know that I never
Um had the chance
"You know,"
Live through if I don't have my
"You know, but of course it cost me money and then again I was always the kind of person who"
Money is not everything and
"I think when I'm least interested in money, when I made the best of it so"
There you go.
"<laughter> and, for example, one of my favorite"
Times in my life probably when I lived in Kenya
and you'd think that
You know a lot of people have that.
really bad vision of it maybe look alive
"in mud dung huts or something and live very primitive I mean it's not that at all, but me and you would think that with the least amount of"
Uh technological <tech> technological innovations and things like that I actually mean and I really didn't have
"They know that a lot of many material goods at the time I mean, I had the explosion I probably had the one of the best"
Years of My Life When I Lived in Kenya
the same thing I probably did when I was about fifteen or sixteen
um
to
live your life with passion
and again how to choose the way I said earlier about
Making decisions
You must make these decisions wisely
what will
give you a sense of reverence and wonder that would make you happy
"and you need it regardless of what the percentages are, even if you have only one percent chance of success, you have to go into this because that's the only thing that will deliver"
You know happiness in your life
"<tisk> the fact that I stuck to it and was brazen, whatever you want to say, the balls have the chutzpah the cojones to go and"
Follow my
passions and
"You know, and I guess people sometimes call them strong choices, usually"
"Decisions that are simple <ea> if you don't normally give pleasure where you remain unharmed, that's just murphy's law, that's exactly the way it is"
safe
See you.
