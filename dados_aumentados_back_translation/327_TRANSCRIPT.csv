Meeting different people different places different customs

Haughty People
"I don't try to get angry, but sometimes I try to learn that I learn to walk away from things, but sometimes people provoke you"
um
I'm getting better I'd say seventy five percent under control
Oh about a month ago <sigh>um with my daughter and her finances
It's really hard that you don't like to argue with your kids.
I have two girls one twenty-three and one twenty-six lives in louisiana and one lives here
Now that they're older
to give contentment to someone else's love
Care
"Well, unfortunately, when I was young, my sister was abducted, so when my children grew up, I was worried about her and I didn't let her do much on my own."
"Oh, now it's easy because they're grown up and they're living on their own, so it's much easier now, but I still worry you even though they're grown up"
I'm sorry about what you said.
"Oh, my goodness, they're spoiled, they've got everything"

Loneliness depression
Especially after I didn't leave family members in the United States.
I went to a consultant and then to group therapy.
Yes
"I usually enjoy group therapy because you're in a group, with other people over your..."
you like your aversion to your problems and sometimes someone else shares the same as you and you can share <sh> you know what you're going through and what can help you make it better
"It has influenced me a lot, it has helped me cope with things I can talk to."
"Yes, I didn't want to admit it, but after a while and feeling depressed for so long I knew I had to do something"
pretty good
not only getting more positive better

Thank you.
"Well, I went from full-time to part-time and there's not so much work in the automotive industry, so I decided to go back to school"
To just go for fun
easy to understand with
Uh my mother she is very tall four children alone and was a very hard worker
"in order not to give up positive in everything you try to achieve, you can do it"
um 
don't go to school earlier
"No, because I raised two kids alone, so now that they're grown up, I don't have an apology, so I do."
"I'm friendly, I'm a hard worker and most of the time I'm easy to understand with"
"As I say, I'm a hard worker, if you give me work, I'll do it, and as long as I'm not in a good mood most of the time, so I'm just gonna deal with it."
"And if I'm not most people, they can't see it by my attitude, just don't talk to me."
To as I say bike ride or uh walks on the beach the beach is very relaxing
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
