value
"Yeah, that's fine."
I'm fine.
How are you?
originally I am from San Francisco
Originally I moved here in Gosh nineteen ninety five
then I went to Chicago
then to San Francisco and then back to go close probably about five years ago
A lot moves <Laughter>
Never
um
there's just nothing left for me
The weather is better in l_a
but the people in San Francisco are nicer
"my husband prefers <pref> my ex-husband prefers it here, so we moved"
I have an undergraduate degree in psychology and then I went to law school
"When I was in college, I worked at a law firm."
and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting
No now I am a stay-at-home-mama
Scrubbed_entry
no
um
"I love it, but it's"
difficult you need to manage a life to make sure that they
will be
a good and successful person
"Uh <sigh> i it's easy, somehow the academics and so that you know that I'm good, that the hardest thing I think is to lead them"
emotional
to help him through things he has
a hard time with the feeling that I don't have all the answers
just to see them grow and experience new things and
learning about life and the world it's just it's really really cool
completely different <Laughter>
completely different me and I'm not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him
he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all
My parents are dead.
I didn't even talk to my dad before he died.
"I have a sister and a brother who actually doesn't know where they are, and I don't talk to them either."
um
Probably shyer because I consider myself more reserved
I like to listen to music
"I have to listen to all kinds of music, but my favorite when I relax is uh eighties music <laughter> cheesy cheesy, but true"
It depends on who I'm with when I'm with my son.
I can control my temperament
um
When I'm at it
my ex-husband or other adults mm yeah <ye> yeah I don't
So-so-so-so
Yesterday
And it was about my ex-husband with the woman he cheated on when we were married.
um
"I found out he cheated on me, and I threw him out."
And he told me yesterday that he was still with her.
"Yeah, that's good."
um
really angry
and just very hurt
um
I wish I had
"spoke to my father before he died, I wish I had settled our differences before he died."
the hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually
To end my marriage
Because he cheated on me
um
that should be
"Well, I don't know, I mean, I don't know if I want to erase something from my memory because it makes me"
who I am today
So I can't really think of an event that I want to delete
"I don't sleep well, it's not easy for me to wake up a lot at night."
"I don't know, I wish I knew if I knew I could change it"
"I could try to do something about it, but I just don't know."
um
Dimples irritable
"Uh, grumpy irritable around"
bottom
mixed with anger < sigh>
It's
just because of everything I'm going through with my
soon to become ex-husband
"Yes, there it is."
um
I'll just keep it in.
"I mean, there's nothing else to do except [exce> I mean, it's what it is, so"
I have to
how to deal with it
no
Yes
"Ten years ago, after my son was born"
or nine years ago
I felt like
I couldn't handle life.
I was so depressed.
I couldn't believe I couldn't do anything.
no
"I'm not going to therapy, I'm going to medication management."
But I'm not doing talk therapy.
"I went to the therapist's, and no, they're not helping."
um
"Well, some just sit and stare at you and say nothing"
"You know, if I wanted to talk to myself,"
others give advice that I think is just
it's just not good and not on the point
um
It was probably this morning that I was playing with my son.
just really happy that I haven't thought about it
one of the other shit <sigh>
"To in my life I could just forget it, so I felt really happy"
ugh
"I think they would describe me completely differently than the way I would describe myself, but"
um
I think they'd describe me as really sweet
Because they're really cute.
confident
"Uh, going out."
"Because that's what I'm trying to be for people, so I think they'd describe me like this."
"I wish I wasn't sad, I wish I was more confident"
um
"Yes, there are a lot of things"
I think
It would be...
not
not
give my life over to a certain person who is what I did with my husband
I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son
hanging around the pool with fun going to dinner
uh
one of my two friends two really good friends I think were really positive influences in my life
um
Scrubbed_entry
"Your life is worse than mine, but we can always get together."
Scrubbed_entry
"is just really positive I mean, she's always happy up always looking for the bright side, so that's helped me a lot"
my son
I went to a friend's home and we had movie night we saw ourselves an adult movie and dinner and wine
and the guys were in another room watching movies and video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening
mhm
safe <Laughter>
See you.
