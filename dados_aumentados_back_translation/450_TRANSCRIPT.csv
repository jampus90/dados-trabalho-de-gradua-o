Honest uh funny to pretty
"I have an entrepreneur, an entrepreneur for whom I worked, who had a very positive influence at least in my professional life."
"Um, I had..."
a consultant at u_c_l_a who was totally thinking about her
common
and some of the little things she had said to me
Let me live on in my life
Trust in the process
She told me to trust the trial.
"And when people have problems and I have problems, I take a step back and say,"
"You know, just trust the process it's all it works like it's supposed to be"
There's another one.
positive influence I knew in Hawaii
That's what taught me...
"a friend of mine, who lives on Kauai, who taught me,"
how to enjoy nature and teach me how to fish and
and I love her very much a great positive influence
"healthy, healthy influence"
It's not
I have back problems.
so it's hard to sleep at night
I wake up in the middle of the night.
Uh Stretching and
"To straighten my back, I have a back problem that sometimes more often than not"
prevents me from sleeping well
"That's okay, I'll take care of it."
"I'm a little depressed, I was a little depressed, I didn't work that much, and..."
I have pain in the morning and evening < eveni> I have pain thorughout the day in my back
"And it's a little depressing, you know, I'm getting depressed, too."
You know you're just thinking about it
my business that I sold and
You know where I would've been if I hadn't done that and
a general feeling of
I've been a little depressed in the last few years.
Yes
"Well, I've been diagnosed many years ago and I guess depression stays with you even though it's being treated"
um
and I was diagnosed about two years ago
I don't know that it asked me on the questionnaire.
and uh and I were looking for treatment
and then my insurance ran out
and the recipes
"I couldn't make my recipes anymore, but now I'm back to..."
"You know, so I'm taking medication for my depression"
Therapy absolutely
I love therapy
wow that's huge to trust in yourself uh
Trust in myself for confidence in my decision-making
a general feeling of
Total content uh
a sound record
"You know, if I have stuff that bothers me that I can't?"
I feel that I can't go to the person with
i um
can go to my therapist and
"Many times the problem is solved there, it was not a big problem, or I worked through it or the therapist by the therapist allowed me to consider another way of looking at the situation"
and in this way I find to be therapy
really priceless
I think so.
"Yes, I was."
I think it was
I think I was told by a psychiatrist that I was what I had.
and this was within the last
Five years I think it was

"Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute,"

Good question
I'd have to think about it.
I regret in life that you know everything works.
"So, um..."
"You know, if I could change the past, I would never have left school."
when I did a long time ago I mean I've gone back since then and done a lot of things
I probably would have gone to the military.
I think I wanted to do this in my early twenties.
I'm fifty-five now.
I kind of regret not doing that.
around at this time
I regret it.
Selling my business
I regret
"and of course I can't control it, but I regret that my father died when I was so young and"
"He never really met me, and I never really met him."
I regret uh
I don't regret seeing it
my grandmother enough before she died
I regret uh
"I mean, these are the things I can think of right now, not putting away for retirement, I regret when I had the money to do it"
um
"Yeah, that's good."
"I mean,"
That's exactly what I'd say.
Stay with it.
"Just stick to it, because to get out you have to get through"
and
"When it comes to fear or escape, I get the fear and I fly"
sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then
Everything works
Wow
I am very proud that I have remained <sigh>
Real
I'm very proud of
who I am
and to be basically comfortable and I'm proud that I haven't changed
to the world <wor> to the world you know for the world I have not changed I have remained
Who I am
Thank you.
Thank you.
See you.
