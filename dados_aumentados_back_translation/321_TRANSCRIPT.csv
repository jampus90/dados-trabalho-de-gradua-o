My husband's work was here.
in eighty-four
it wasn't easy for me it took about three years
"only the move I moved away from my family, so it was uncomfortable for me that I didn't know anyone here and even though I found friends, I just felt out of place"
"Uh not as often as I would like me to go back as I did at least once a year, but in recent years this has decreased, so I would say as every three years"
the weather <Laughter>
I love the weather of the beach
"You know how I'm here as long as I have the people you know, some nice people here."

I would say the economy
it is very difficult to make it here in los engeles
Enterprises

It's very hard.

I like to talk to people too much.
and
"If I understand it or if I know a lot about a subject, I can go on and on about it and I'm interested in finding out about people if I'm sitting next to someone, I'm going to have a conversation with them just to find out who they are and"
I'd like to talk to people who enjoy it.
I'm calm.
um
Let's see rude people.
People who harm children and older people <el> older people who make me very angry
Uh War
I control my temperament
I have no problem with just being calm when I'm angry and trying to think before I act
The last time I had a fight with someone about a month ago
"And it was with my daughter, and I was arguing with her about her therapy."
She has cancer and she hasn't told me enough that she doesn't give me enough information and that made me very angry I was frustrated and angry
"Yes, it was very difficult"
No <Laughter>
Your children fail to observe when they try hard or see that they hurt themselves and try to prepare them for it if they do not listen to your advice
"and she uh I feel, sometimes they have to trust me more"
mhm
for the love of my children
"Yeah, that's good."
When I was playing with my granddaughter and that was about a month ago.

I knew something was wrong.

mhm
My children
mhm

I don't know <Laughter>
friendly
I think it's just terrible <Laughter>
"Um, I can feel it."
the children are so neglected today and it is not the fault of the parents I think that
I think that as a society we forget that it takes a village to raise a child and
No one wants to help in anyone anymore no one wants to help their neighbors anymore and it's very sad
mhm
um
I don't know.
