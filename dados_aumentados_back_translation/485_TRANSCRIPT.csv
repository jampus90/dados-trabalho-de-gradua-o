Yes
"I'm not bad, I'm a little tired, but okay"
uh by saint louis missouri
yep
Two months ago
I don't often think I'm out here now.
Uh smaller city fewer people everyone somehow seems different the pace of life is slower out there
uh looking for work as a game designer or game developer only
try something new to new place new people
I think I'll get used to it.
um
I guess...
"People are different, you know there are small shops everywhere."
Everything is different
"Man, the weather's great out here."
people are really nice
how to look at the mountains the beach is beautiful
only
Better geography
around traffic I guess the commute
and sometimes there may be too many people
< slaughter>
not really never outside the u_s before
"I never had the opportunity, but I'd like to leave."
uh game design and graphic design type of
"Oh, I love it"
uh
mm play video games since I was a kid like most guys my age so
easy how to make people happy and it's somehow easy to do that with games
< slaughter>
Uh working for myself make my own games and write my own paychecks I think
"I've been trying to do it in the last few years, it's a little difficult"
"I think I'm kind of shy, it depends on the people and the environment I think,"
< slaughter>
Uh playing guitar listening to some music talking to friends
I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temperament I'm not the kind of guy that gets really easily angry
Probably with my girlfriend about something stupid I can't remember.
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"I don't know, I don't think I'm really guilty about everything I'm trying to avoid being guilty"
hmm
Don't know
I can't think of anything.
Leaving Saint Louis was one of them because all my friends and family were there.
Uh I guess the benefits outweigh
You know the disadvantages
Definitely
huh <sigh> maybe thrown out of high school for the first time
I got myself and my friends in trouble.
It was just not good for you to look back at it somehow and
"I guess that's something from my past, I wish I'd done it differently."
uh
"According to the <Laughter> rules, I think only a good student would have helped"
uh
not really so close to my family I have a small family anyway and
"when I was in Saint Louis, we saw each other a few times a year, but that's really it, so no strong ties"
I guess most of my friends are always there to support and encourage me and help me.
"say pretty easy every now and then there's a night I can't sleep, but it's quite rare"
mm only tired groggy
I guess my mind is unfocused and
Day goes by a hell of a lot longer
"Um, pretty good."
not really much to say
"maybe a little more depressed because I'm away from most of my friends and family, but"
Nothing Insurmountable
Just try to talk to them when I can think of something else that thinks of happy times.
no
no
Uh <sigh> I guess on the ride out here
Because it was such a new experience and so intoxicating
I think I was really proud of myself and looking forward to the future.
"just I guess some kind of euphoria standing there, it seemed kind of surreal <su> surreal"
uh
funny caring nice guy
easy to understand with
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"Pretty happy to be me, I guess"
hmm
"Guess when I broke up with my last girlfriend, for obvious reasons you're trying to fight and say things you wanted, you'd forget."
"No, I don't like living in the past, so there's nothing really to regret"
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
work hard and only
Think about what you do before you do it
Play video games with friends on the computer
uh
Music Uh
and my friends I appreciate <Laughter>
mm
I appreciate my determination and my xxx my passion
for my creativity
See you.
