this is an interesting experiment

I'm from the middle of nowhere
<Sigh> uh
the second of two thousand seven can
so exactly five years ago six years ago
um
rare as once every few years
"Uh the weather exists, so it's more extreme"
And then it's
less
exciting
much less colorful
Uh Winter in Minnesota <Laughter>
It took about
"the ride into that is, that's all it took the lights, uh"
the lights took care of the rest
uh
"I love that it's a huge concrete playground at night, so bycicles uh"
have free reins of the streets I like all the art I love
"the fact that there are so many different types of culture jammed all together and that if you are looking hard enough, you will find everything you really want here"
"Oh, you know."
the traffic <sigh>
Excessive cost of living
uh
"Yeah, they're my big cattle."
Not nearly as much as I'd like.
I've done a little bit
I don't like it
"To know exactly how things will go, I like the fact that it forces me to"
to act with people in order to:
to deal with situations in a way that I normally wouldn't have
uh
Last year I
Hang out in San Marcos for a little bit
after I broke up with my ex
and then
after san marcos I went back to iowa for a series of family stuff and then I brought my little brother to go to Angeles
< slaughter>
uh
last week
managed to go on a bike tour for Cyclavia
Scrubbed_entry
when <Laughter> he was basically a rolling green light all the way down venice boulevard and so he made a pile like
national news and
"he was everywhere, but the rest of us as his support group"
Riding on big bikes and things we don't
"Bat one eye we did not blink because this is normal for our friends who didn't even do the most absurd thing he's done lately, that was just a happy normal Sunday"
but
our group of friends
is so unusual that a normal Sunday for us is extreme for everyone else
< slaughter>
"I used to be an introverter, but definitely an extroverter in recent years, thanks los Angeles"
um
♪ Empty the throat ♪
once I found the right group of friends
it was easy to be social
pulled me out to be socially extroverted as well
bombastic for the first time and it's stuck
um
"If I wasn't the most relaxed guy, I'd probably do things, but if I was really stressed out"
I do all kinds of things
It's...
usually I try to enroll my friends to help me make an art project
What a temperament <Laughter>
uh
Scrubbed_entry
um
[Laughter] Panic because I really didn't want him to hate me
and I've mostly failed
uh
hard for him
I have mostly uh mostly with
a few scratches on my ego
uh
if:
"when all this went I tried to talk to him, but I was distracted for the first time on that day and so instead of"
with my <sigh>
"verbal gloves until I make it,"
Take a whole series of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was
not my most graceful moment
uh
I feel guilty about so much stuff.
I feel guilty about eating more often than anything else
"'Cause I love junk food it's really good, I have very little eating willpower because I used to be a fat guy"
I don't know what the toughest decision I've ever had to make.
Uh made a lot of tough decisions
I guess <sigh>
It was pretty hard to leave Angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty things.
but
It wasn't even that hard because it urged me to do it like that.
"It's a tricky question, madam."
Uh oh you know broken collarbone
strong pain getting surgery on it all seemed as if it made sense at the time
< slaughter>
mm
no
My memories are important
"I've lived a spoiled blessed life, and if I've changed something, it wouldn't be the same universe that I've lived like this universe."
< slaughter>
uh
"My little brother lives here, he's fantastic, he's waiting for me outside."
uh
my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy I'm pretty crazy
uh
but
because most of them live so far away don't really have to have too much relationship with them is positive and sparce
uh
Jackrabbit has influenced me quite positively lately.
She's a magical creature
uh
"Well, there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful"
there's the part where they
Managed
Hit me with the best inspiration words there is the part where they
"actually working on the exact things that make me excited, there's the part where she dives into and out of my life at the just right instance and then there's the part"
where:
she is 100% friendly and caring
all the time
"all these things are really beautiful, but then when you add that and it comes with the fact that"
She's doing all this
without wanting anything in return
I don't know that
<sigh> beaten <laughter>
uh
"What a funny question, how do I know them, as if they were several people, how did you know?"
uh
I know her through my
Bicycle friends <sigh>
uh
"the hard part goes to bed, but as soon as I get to sleepland, I'm pretty much there until an earthquake hits uh"
so
I'm sleeping.
"bad, but then I'm a pro at it, so it doesn't matter"
"<deep breath> less verbal and that's it, my dark circles get a little bigger and I'm pretty much the same guy because I've done it most of my life"
so excited that I might as well be in fire
By mm
because
the universe
in its
Infinite
I suppose the word is Sardinian sense of humor
uh managed to get me from the
Reality
of magic
in the arthur c clark sense
- Nope.
as a lucky man and <Cough>
be vaguely conscious
It is my privilege to enjoy more time like this.
uh
"Yeah, that's good."
my excitement increases at an almost exponential rate
and I feel more and more inspired all the time
"If I could only work on the motivation, I would be hired"
"Not since you asked me on the form some time ago, no"
"Uh, no, I thought I had it, but who knows at this point, that was a while ago."
uh
I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then I moved to go angels and
started having fun mm and then the uh yeah the rest is old history
um
20 thirteen <Laughter>
uh
"Working on my shoes this morning was really nice, uh"
an art project that all my friends
"That was really nice, it's a nice feeling."
< slaughter>
<Sigh>
"That's a very good question, I'm not really sure I'm going to ask him today."
um
I guess I'm
enthusiastic
I'm
thesauric
And I'm
<Sigh>
I have to say:
Highly analytical <Laughter>
uh
"It would be nice if I could get my superpowers back, that would be pretty cool."
uh
how to turn on some of the fans
"finely tuned and delicate machines, the Chinese medicine has got me into"
< slaughter>
uh
That's really hard.
I think the thing I'm most proud of
would be likely
<Sigh>
You know I'm not sure.
< slaughter>
"oh all kinds of things, but I'm working on it"

No problem
