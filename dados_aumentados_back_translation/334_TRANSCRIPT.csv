value
All right.
Yes
pretty good a little tired
Washtone (seattle washton)
"When I was 18, my parents decided we wanted to move to California, so we moved to Pasadena."
"Yeah, that's good."
I went to work about two years ago and took a look at the area
pretty simple actually
I'll adjust.
the warm weather not with rain nine months of the year around
Population in the first place
"the uh the area, how big it is traffic"
"When I first came here, the smog, that's better now"
"No, when I was younger, I was but I got away with the work I did."
"sure, when I became, when I died my mother and I needed work, I went for a job called petition"
and uh you have to go to the stores and talk to people about signing petitions
"and you do that after a while you won't be shy about talking to someone, even when I was in school, I took public speaking and I learned that it really liked more than I thought I would"
So I did the census job that I actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to do the test and I enjoyed it.
"Right now, I'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance."
um
and I'll start working uh trying to get money from people uh help kids in the uh in the world
"Well, the one on the uh job helping kids was also a paid job I needed a paid job"
the uh one for insurance I was getting older and I needed work that was steadfast and that's something I can do until I'm eighty five or ninety or whatever.
< slaughter>
To be an artist
"Well, I was good with art"
I like painting et cetera
"But I didn't know if I could ever live with it, so I never really came in and every time I tried, I never seemed to have come anywhere"
So maybe if I'm like eighty or ninety maybe I'm going to go into ceramic or something like that and do that as a profession
not unfortuantely I do not
That's okay.
I'm not
my mother and father are dead I have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or I don't talk to them or anything
"Well, I have a kind of attitude that if I have myself and friends I'm okay"
Uh read
uh
Watch sports when they are available
"uh let's see i used to play golf I can do that again one day, but not now because of the cost and time"
People who are rude
"Well, normally I ignore it this morning actually I told a guy to stop what he did and we got some kind of argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done"
very good because I had a very bad temper when I was a child and I told myself that I had to control it
This morning because of the guy who makes a lot of noise.
"and in a place that just wasn't the place to do it, I mean, it was a public place"
But...
and that was just a small argument and I'm done with the argument as soon as I say what I say <Laughter>
Yes
not now that I can think
Uh how to read
um
"when I can travel I travel uh I don't travel long distances, but even out to the river is a kind of adventure for me"
Seeing things on the way
and back
"Talk to people, maybe"
well a number of years ago I went back east to uh massachusetts
"to work there on the way back, I took a Greyhound bus all the way back from Washton d_c all the way back to California"
Uh into the washtone first and then from down there
and uh
Work in Massachusettes for about six months to eight months
"enjoyed the area a little, but didn't want to be there when the snow came"
and uh
enjoyed back in the bus had people near me almost all the way different people and
had a lot of fun
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yes, I was in the Air Force and uh when I was eighteen nineteen sixty-five during the Vietnam War"
no I was in big falls montana
it really didn't years later I probably uh learned more from the fact that I got out early and maybe I would have stayed in
"and stayed there, but I tended to end things when I was younger and so now that and other things I decided never to end anything"
I came down here uh played pool for a number of years uh finally graduated from high school that I had dropped when I moved
uh went to college got my bachelor's degree and an A-A degree from Pasadena and Cal State l_a and started working different jobs and uh that's it
took care of my mother
uh business that was my head I also studied cyclical anthropology and philosophy and history et cetera
no
not never depressed <de>
lately not so good between the fact that I sleep in my car and it's very cold and then sometimes I get uh
and with all the things in my life right now I'm thinking about things and so and plus I get up at four thirty in the morning
That's okay.
Uh tired
and sometimes I get a little grumpy but not very
tired with all the things I had to do and uh weather and sleep
no
Uh a little sometimes about how maybe I should have started all this years ago
I'll just keep going.
I'm basically telling myself to stop it and keep doing what things to improve
not very anymore
It took me years to study to do that.
"I don't know if you call it Zen or not, but"
"A few months ago, when I passed all my tests"
and uh medicare <medi> uh medicare advantage
and all of them for every company she sent to me
"I stick to everything I do now, I'm persistent"
I won't leave things out of my hands until I do something about it.
I used to be uh
What's the word?
I'm putting things away that I don't do anymore.
and uh
I always treat people beautiful
Until given a reason not to
and I usually don't talk to anyone about my bad stuff
< slaughter>
"not very, because the same thing that I have trained over the years, so as not to talk about myself"
"I'm talking to other people, I'm talking about them."
Let's see.
my mother
Gandy
um
bertrand russell
Let's see.
I'm not sure who else
"other people I had, but I don't remember their names or they were teachers et cetera"
earlier in life uh like I said uh everything didn't end things I'm very sorry about
- Nope.
I could have done better.
probably the advice I've given myself to get out of my butt and learn and get an education uh and continue to do something with my life
that I have survived
"Well, I'm sixty-five, I slept in my car for a number of years I went from sleeping to sidewalk where I got a car"
"while I did improve my credit rating, I got a number of jobs that I was very satisfied with."
I had a lot of friends.
both homeless people who are homeless and not homeless
and uh
I'm in pretty good health
and where like other people in my family died young
So I think that's what this is about.
Uh good jokes
uh people who have a happy time
go and have a drink with someone on an occasional basis
About eight months ago was the last time I had a beer with someone
Let's see.
Probably uh
always within a foot of a living wild deer
It was in uh green lake in Washton
"and I uh was behind our house and this wild deer walked in the field and I started moving, and it came within about a foot of me"
"and the only reason why it left my father drove the ride way and it made noise and the deer ran away I was in fondle distance from him and I wasn't sure if he would have petted or not, but I was about to <Laughter>"
like you
See you.
