value
<sync>
Yes
I'm doing pretty well.
I was born and raised here in los engeles
<sigh>to the weather
um
would be the number one I like also the varied uh
Cultures
I like the fact that there are a lot of different things you can do here.
"and there is a lot of opportunity here not only for me, but for my children"
And I think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career in school
to learn about different people
transport the cost of living
um
Sometimes I think it's too big
"and I think the transport system as far as the bus and trains around is long overdue, they have to renovate it or"
"You know, add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around by public transport"
"I travel when I'm a little here and there I haven't been abroad yet, which is a destination of mine in the next few years"
So I just traveled inland I tried to take at least one trip a year somewhere
I like the fact of getting on the plane and going places that go especially somewhere I've never been.
and learn about the place you know like so when I'm going to d_c I'm really looking forward to it because there's a historic city
You know things like that
My last trip would have been d_c < laughter> last year.
I went to a friend and I stayed over
three < thr> I think three to four days
And I need to see the Capitol
"He showed me everything you know about historical sights and sites, the white house."
the capitol building around I have a lot of other uh government buildings to see
and it was a good experience the irony was that I had to fly to nine eleven and that had me a little restless
but once I was on the plane up in the air I was okay and it was all good and once I was back home I was like yes
but I miss the trip and I look forward to returning
"To attend my girlfriend's wedding, she had a goal wedding in Hawaii."
um
"In fact, maui"
that was actually two three three years ago three years ago
"in August and around, I've been trying to get back, since then, and I want my children and"
I just love it there and I'm really looking forward to moving there for a day
I have three sons at thirteen-year-old twins
"Boys and my youngest is also a boy, he's eight"
"they have all birthdays in June the twins are on the ninth of June and my baby is on the fourth of June and so they are only a few days apart, but"
5 years apart technical
and they're just super super
typical boys everywhere active hormones puberty around so it is actually an interesting time because you know that the two older boys go through puberty
They're teenage years
about my youngest
um
still trying to figure out some things for yourself you do that transition period from eight to nine years old
"So he'll be nine in June and then my elder will be fourteen, so it's a challenging time for me too."
only the joy of seeing what you consider to be parents every day and seeing how
only with love and care and around
"the right and you know, well I can't say right development, but only with"
You know love and care as a baby grows to a toddler in
You know a young boy to a teenager and then to a young man and so that experience alone has rewarded yourself just to see my sons grow up and go through these different stages
"and see how they developed, and you know,"
to see some of the things they're going through now that so remind me of my teenage years
and it's only very rewarding and actually I'm looking forward to being a foster parent later on when they're older and off to college because I really love and give children back
um
"There's probably a few things, but I'd just say"
um
for me as a lone parent is to the financial
"Well, I would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them to bear the main burden of the responsibility of just child upbringing"
um
You know the
just the everyday things of what you have to do with the
"Sometimes, when you're just tired, you don't want to be disturbed or you try to do things for yourself."
"You need to be reminded that oh okay I need to cook, or I need to pick up my son or I need to take him to the baseball exercise."
"This is going to go over here, this is moody, and you know that kind of challenge."
As well as the finances and you know that you know that you are able to eat on the table you pay your rent and
"You know, day after day, and these are the two that are probably the hardest things I'm dealing with."
"Well, I take it day after day, I just lay one foot in front of the other and..."
"I am extremely spiritual, so I rely on God and"
Pray and meditate a lot
um
When I see that I need some help when
"You know I'm I'm not up asking for help, so sometimes when I reach out to people or"
"You know what other resources are out there to help me, you know that I'm trying to do that, and so for me now my biggest challenge is just"
I try to go back to school to get myself into a better economic situation so that I can continue to care for them.
To I studied communication actually I was a major in journalism public relations with a minor in sociology
and now I'm studying Business <Laughter>
I just thought you knew.
"There would be more opportunities for me with the economy, up to jobs."
and then I know you have the desire to go to graduate school so I thought in the long run it was a better
It would put me in a better position to give me more opportunities.
with the communication it is a little limited and especially as you get older around the fields of t_v reporting and things like this around
are somehow
will be
"You know, more difficult to get"
So I just thought I was going into something more realistic
and
"You know, but I like both areas that I really like that I'm writing by reading how you can say and we'll see,"
"around <Laughter> a couple probably, but I'd say at the end"
would travel like works like a travel writer to go to different destinations
to try out different foods to write about different people
Cultures around
learn and live you know uh about the different people and cultures live < l> live under <am> under the
You know the people there and...
"to be interactive with the children and something like that, so I hope to be able to do that one day, but yes to"
It would be something in this direction and then the relapse would be a consultant to social workers something in this area.
"If I could cover all three, I hope I can do that"
"This is actually a difficult question, probably because I grew up very shy at first."
and not as shy as I am now reserved
um
"but not conservative, but only reserved and you know when I go somewhere I am"
check everything that everyone else out
and then once I'm comfortable or acclimatized the situation then I'm like okay you know that I warm up to the situation or people
but I'm also friendly I can speak very friendly and starting I like
You know.
I seem like a chatter box but I'm not really that normal when I'm in a big room with a whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention I can
to bind to one or two persons; and
"You know, you'll be kind to them, but I overall I'm an open friendly person"
< slaughter>
um
"For me, it could be something as simple as undressing."
all electronics and just sit for a few moments
Meditate
to pray or read a good spiritual scripture
um
if I am able to go for a good massage
Maybe get a facial
um
You know things that will
I like the physical part of it I like massages things that really solve tension
um
"and if not, then just as I said, just sit at home reading and praying or"
I like the beach I love the beach so sometimes I drive and go sitting on the beach
I like <li> even maybe
go and eat alone or a Mani Pedi or
maybe go shopping windows you know things like that
mm pretty good sometimes I'm just like grr I don't really have so much a problem with the temperament
as I am only I am impatient
Unfortunately many times with people and you know situations
so I can just get really irritable or irritable
um
quite excited especially when it's the time of the month for me I'm just
Lose patience outside of it
"I'm actually pretty good I'm trying, very much you know where I'm at and"
"be very patient with people, especially if I could see that the person is"
as if they were a new <n> a new cashier person at the counter or cashier I try to be
I try to be patient and understanding
"'Cause I'd want you to know if I was, I'd want someone to extend that to me."
"You know, with my kids sometimes you know that it's, it works both way once it's the time of the month, I'm just like ugh just leave me alone"
"Um, or I could have a short temperament or a short fuse"
So I'm aware I'm trying to be
"conscious and trying to monitor it, but you know how everyone I am human and there are times or I have my days or moments in which I could just go like ugh and"
Just lose it.
To <sigh>
"Well, I didn't really have any argument in itself, but there was an ongoing thing with American Express, so I'd say"
because there is no personal
Contact
But a company I anyway we
"It was really an argument, but I had a few problems with American Express, which I had to call about on Saturday, and I stopped thinking that I didn't get that."
Answer I expected and so I would get all the contact the call was just back and forth
"very frustrating and I was upset and you know that the representative tried to persuade me, then I tried to persuade her."
"So you know, I don't know if you'd consider that an argument, but I'd definitely say that's the last time you know."
I just somehow reached my boiling point.
to say the least and was really excited and
"Oh, that <th> that was the next thing you know to make an argument and then I had to call back this morning that you don't really escalate to an argument"
but it was a tense exchange for one or two minutes
probably the latest contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express
um
or actually it was on Sunday yeah and around
I know
"the person tried to help me, but you know if you're constantly being told different things and I had to call about five or six times about the same situation"
"and it will not be solved, it will only lead you there so"
um
I kept raising my voice and saying that I shouldn't have had things.
and easy was more so allowed me to lose control of the contact I really like to feel it in control of the contact
and so around it just took me there my blood pressure was raised
"Excuse me, and that was just some sort of chaos for a while, for about thirty minutes or an hour after."
just irritable and excited and excited and so I always try to know you
Go back and
"to draw from them, and"
"You know, do my own sense of feedback and"
"see how I could know how to treat things differently, but that's one I definitely wish I had my cool and was more level-headed and"
and not really raised my voice and you know to be more polite
<Sigh>
mm
"Well, I probably had a couple but < clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they were probably my twins they were probably about two"
and I was back in a situation with her father and became pregnant and around
It was just not a good time
and he pretty much knew you wasn't comfortable with me another kid at the time
and around me was not comfortable
"with another child either, but wanted to keep the baby, but"
"He put me under so much stress, and you know, I kind of wanted to say, really pushed me to end the pregnancy."
and that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy the child I'm thinking about
"that the baby or what would have been I could not try to keep anger or resentment against him or anyone about it, but I know deep inside secretly when I had it to do everything again"
"I just would have kept the baby and moved forward, so that would've been it."
probably the hardest especially emotional I could deal with a lot and I've dealt with a lot you know to
"You're unemployed, or you know a lot of financial problems, but that was the hardest thing for me."
Thank you.
no
mm mm mm
no
"Okay, you know."
I was released in December
so I've been all the time
try to do things you know to get back on my feet
So that was a little hard I had to face a lot of challenges
and dealing with it and problems with child support and trying to find another job and go back to school
So I mean my area of emotions were just that a range and a very good friend of mine now that we both started
"You know, in the same place"
"About five years ago, she was able to move forward and continue with her life, and now she's graduating."
"next month of u_s_c with her master in social work, so I feel a little envious of it and I have been for as last year, but in more recent times"
"although I'm very happy for them you know, and she's a good person and she deserves it, but xxx of course deep inside I wish it was me, so that somehow also has disturbed me"
All right.
I am really good with people I communicate well
"I like to talk, I'm really good with kids, so I'd like to teach or be a consultant around"
"Although I didn't really tap it, I know I'm a very creative person"
um
"I know I write pretty well, I might be a creative writer, but I know I'm very creative, so"
"When I have the opportunity, I know that I could tap that and develop these skills like songwriting for fiction writing."
um
but probably like interior decoration
all artistic just everything because I love music I love the arts I love drama I love plays
um
"I'm not a big fashion buff, but I love fashion and make-up and so"
"I think that would be my strengths, and I would only know people I know that I would make a great consultant who my friends come to me, all the time I have a good ear to listen to"
I'm a great mediator and I know how to do it because I've been through a lot.
"and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that actually completed s_c, but to"
I know I'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and I don't know if it has
to do with you know with older parents themselves or how I grew up or I had very traditional southern parents
"Who has instilled many great values in me, or whether it has something to do with my astrological sign, I am a Pisces"
But I'm
really good with people only you know time period
"You know, like I said, I have my moments, but I know if it's something I could go into and develop that I would do well."
mm not really
I wish I'd waited for me to get married before I had children looking for another partner.
um
"and I say that I'm my son's father is great, but to"
"a great father for my children, but not so much as a partner for me, we're not together, we haven't been together for years, but"
"I'm just saying, overall, I think, uh, I had"
yeah I think I'd say if I could let myself be traced back saying not to finish school if I had and couldn't follow my dreams and goals and do things as I somehow planned first and
I think this is
that I would honestly be the one thing I could say I'm not sorry to follow my goals and finish school on time and follow what I really wanted to do
stay focused and finish school and choose a career path and
Stay with it and stay motivated and let nothing or anyone deter you
mm
I think I'm pretty stable and consistent just
with overall I think about how I faced adversity as I face < f> i
face things you know to
I'm a pretty dedicated person I'm trying to tell you when I say imma do something I'm trying to keep it I'm a very loyal friend
I'm proud to have raised my children solo.
All right.
Thank you.
See you.
