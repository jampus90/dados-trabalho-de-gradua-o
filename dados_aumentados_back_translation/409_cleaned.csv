I'm fine.
I'm from uh l_a
"Yeah, that's good."
I like the weather I like the sports teams I like the entertainment
"Yeah, that's good."
"Uh, it's pretty much the same year around as well as actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get all four seasons, so it's kind of like a mixed bag"
and
"I guess I'm kind of used to it by now, so it would be kind of nice to explore other areas."
"I've lived here all my life because I've made too much travel, so uh"
It's a bit of a ruttiness.
"But overall, it's okay."
"Well, I've taken computer programming into operations, but that goes back to the seventies, so the technology has changed a lot, as one can say <Laughter> in the last forty odd years <Laughter>"
"That's why it was my major, yeah."
um
I don't know that it's kind of curious that you have to use your mind.
"it was as if you knew brand new something that you know very new, back in the"
"in the old times that one knows in the seventies, now it's all for computers, but then it was kind of like < sniff> something very unique around"
You didn't see you know too many computers back then.
and around I worked in programming so that I somehow put into the logic of it you know compilation together
You know to solve a
a special to know problem you come up with step by step solutions on I think all kind of back then I was somehow more into the
the analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> I can't say this word now <laughter> the analytical properties of the
the problem
mhm
uh
"No, I kind of turned off, I'm still using computers, but I haven't got yet, I wasn't in programming for a long time"
"Well, I kind of got into another area, kind of a distraction."
"Uh turnoff <divorcion> to turn off to another area in my life, uh that goes back to the..."
"The late seventies I somehow took a different turn and then, when I somehow came back into it, it was"
"I kind of got into another field, so I never really followed it."
up to the degree I wanted
Wow that's a good question <Laughter> I've never thought about it uh
well actually kind of ironic <i> ironic actually something was pretty simple at this time
So maybe that's why I'm a little depressed and then...
At this point I wanted to somehow just do some kind of a beautiful relaxing
"Job but I want something of a challenge, but I don't want to do too much"
"too much thinking, that's almost like the opposite of what I was back in the old days you know"
I just want a nice comfortable relaxing work that I can feel
"Fulfillment, but I don't want to"
too tense of a situation that I am somehow in the place in my life where I just want a nice
relaxing work
Yes <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
"Oh, I'd say"
"good for most shy, but sometimes when I go I could be going out"
"Um, but..."
"I speak in general, I'm shy to start with and then sometimes I can loosen somehow and be more"
Singing and sometimes I can take it to the extreme where I talk too much
as once the funny gates open them kind
"Open up too much, so I have to turn my back on you."
but overall I would say I'm kind of shy as a general behavior
"Oh, really, really, really."
Yes <Laughter>
"Oh, uh,"
"Well, I listen to music around"
I'll take a good look around.
I'm gonna...
What do I do to relax?
well I just try to avoid stressful situations like somehow I stay relaxed I also talk to my friends
I'll be in an area
All around
Type of comfort area where i
I feel safe I can only
Dialogue with people so somehow brings me out of my
Think of my own
Problems I have somehow I just know you focus
about being at the moment with my
Well-known <acqu> Friends and acquaintances
"I'm pretty good, I don't really have a temperament problem."
It takes a lot to get me to explode uh
"I think when I was younger, I was a little bit more"
had a little light temperament I never had a really bad temperament but uh
"Uh Temper isn't really a problem I have, I tend to be quite gentle easy to walk"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Wow, that's a good question."
um
I'm not sure to be honest.
"I would have to think about it, to be honest for a long time <Laughter>, I can't come up with an answer to that."
it's not really part of my repertoire
Nothing comes to my mind from above on my head
All right.
um
"Well, the only thing I can imagine and somehow go back I made some bad investments <in> bad investments"
back about ten years ago
I was more around
I'm trying to think about what word I'm looking for for more people's trust
how uh people and how uh <tisk> I thought were experts in their field
and
"I inherited some money, I was a little careless about it."
"and I just had a mood that you know... nothing would go wrong, kind of a little bit of naivety <nait> nativity"
and unfortunately I've done something bad
Financial decisions that somehow make me into a bad
"Position for the rest of my life, unfortunately, because of a medical condition I have, it's hard for me to recover and you know, make it all out"
So I'd say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions
that I really regret
Wow
hmm
That's a tough one.
I can't think of anything from my head <Laughter>
All right.
oh
"Well, uh, I don't really have too much family left, the only one I have is my..."
It's just me and my uncle.
and we communicate <c> we communicate regularly around
he lives <li> but he lives in clear water florida
So we're all right.
But...
"He's like eight, he's in the eighties, and obviously I'm in the fifties, so..."
"we're doing we kind of have a little conversation he's kind of worried about my well-being, but it's kind of flat on a flat level it's not us getting really deep"
And he has his own problems.
so that we don't really get into too deep a conversation
and different from him it's really there's not really someone else I have
So it probably depressed me a little because I don't really feel
I have someone I can really count on or trust.
"I don't know why, but I have a medical condition, so I think that might be part of the problem."
and
I've been
"a little b_p_a, so I have to get up to go to the toilet."
and
to answer your question <Laughter> to a
long story short <Laughter>
um
it's difficult to sleep a good night I usually wake up uh feeling a little tired
or pain
so it's difficult
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"Well, I feel okay, I mean..."
I felt kind of tempered...
I'm trying to solve problems I don't have.
Responsibilities assumed for
But...
I feel a little calm as of late
no
"Well, I said yes when I filled out the questionnaire and"
"I'm not positive if I was technically diagnosed with taking a uh, I think it's m_m_p_h"
the multifaceted Minnesota
Personality something of whether or not
that goes back about six months ago
"they asked me questions about my memory, but then they also got questions about my"
my well-being also psychologically and I think some of the
The answers said that they
guess that I see a psychologist or a psychiatrist
I didn't follow that.
And that's because...
of philosophical differences
But I think I have one you know.
a mild case of depression
"Well, you know..."
"as I said, I'm just kind of like a way to go in life I'm uh"
"I'm fine, but I know that I"
"Life is passing, so I haven't really fulfilled my life."
"My goals, you know, I'm kind of alone"
"I'd like to have a girlfriend, I don't have a girlfriend, so that's someone I feel like I can get closer."
and I'm not really I'm kind of in a transition time in my life now so uh
"There's a little uncertainty, I've got some you know, some kind of financial uncertainty"
"So, um..."
You know I'm not as good as I'd like to.
Wow
That's a good <laughter>
really happy to
Let me think about it a minute
"Well, it wasn't so long ago that I was actually dealing with <makes sound with mouth>"
"Okay, I know you can really come up with an answer"
I helped a lady she was at a fair.
it was home it was a natural product expo so it was pretty nice we uh
we had some nice meals afterwards there were a lot of exhibitors
Give away really nice samples
"It was in Anaheim, so somehow I got a chance to get away from l_a"
and
"You know some interesting people met who were very extraordinary, they were willing to like"
let me experience your products or services
and
I was near people who
I work with whom I have to socialize with so much
I think I was pretty happy back then and that was about uh
About a month ago
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's it."
Best friend
"I don't know if I really have a best friend, but uh"
I'd say...
hmm
"I don't technically know that I really don't have a best friend, so it's really hard for me to answer that, so uh"
I can't really come with an answer to be honest <Laughter>
um
I like to be conscientious
"You know, I have mistakes and everyone, but I think, overall,"
I'm conscientious I'm trying to be honest for the most part on the most important questions I may know
"say little white lies or you know,"
"I'm not perfect on it, but when it comes to the serious stuff, I tend to be pretty honest and I'm a tough worker I got <g> good work ethics"
um
I tend to
pretty quiet for the most part
um
what do I regret?
well you may have that <Laughter>
"Um, um..."
"I'm just good, just total"
I regret uh
a little more persuasive in in my previous
uh previous life uh
and somehow put me in this position
It's kind of due to my financial decisions that were kind of like my Albatross in my life.
I made some bad decisions and unfortunately
"I have to pay the price for now somehow, so I like"
Something like
Living a kind of pauper existence at the moment that is somehow a kind of depressing
So I'd say that's probably what I regret the most
"Well, I'd say to really know you're somehow going to analyze with what you really feel around"
I think
I gave advice to other people with the opinion of other people
I was kind of gone from
my basic
Being that you know how I really felt
like for example I would do aggressive
"Uh invest that, if it turned out it would have been like a way of winning the lottery I would have been"
good for the rest of my life <Laughter>
but unfortunately it went in the opposite way
too many eggs in this basket
So I kind of regretted going with you
my gut feeling and let other people influence me
and uh
"Because by nature I'm a conservative person, so I really should make more concervative investments"
"in other areas of my life I tend to be more conservative, but somehow I did some"
"aggressive financial decisions, so that's pretty much"
Somehow it always goes back to this area as far as I regret
"Yeah, that's good."
Wow
"That's interesting, I did a lot on the weekend, so <Laughter>"
<Laughter> good
I like to be profitable uh I like to do something where I really can
"You know, making money, it's kind of like my bread and butter time, 'cause I do fairs."
"But if I don't, I might like to look at a few."
You know I'd like to
go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game
Go to the movies.
Going out with a few friends
"So I would just, or you know, just step back a little bit"
but my primary primary focus would be on
"You know, earn money on the weekends"
uh
That's interesting.
proud of
um
I would say that I was living a healthy life by and large I would say I have never been in any kind of really
bad
bad uh
Motor vehicles
um
"You know, i"
"I lived a pretty healthy, healthy life, I'd say that would probably"
I don't know if it's really proud.
"But as far as I was concerned, the course remained as far as"
"no really deep <Laughter> alley to go down, so to speak"
All right.
It's my pleasure.
Goodbye.
