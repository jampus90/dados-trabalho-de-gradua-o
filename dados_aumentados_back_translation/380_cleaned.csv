I'm fine.
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm from Maryland.
"Yeah, that's good."
by Maryland Washton d_c Area
Uh like five weeks ago
Maryland around <deep breath> it's a lot it's a lot less around
Uh xxx it's a uh it's not so nice at this time of year it's more about
"It's fine, it's nice, it's..."
"It's much better, but there's a lot more people going on."
"I'm still getting used to it, so I guess I'm still getting used to it, so..."
um
It's
It's not like...
"Yeah, I'm still getting used to it coming slowly, but I'm sure."
I live in the culver city
I've got one.
"It's okay, I live in a really nasty house, it's cheap, it's cheap, because I live in a friend's apartment."
um
and uh
"but and he lets me stay there for half the price, but the actual place itself is quite terrible <horr> terrible living conditions <Laughter> but I'm moving soon, so"
I can't see your shoes.
"uh but no I travel xxx I would say i xxx I probably have more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel to the u_s, but I wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything"
I enjoy the chance to see others
To walks of life and and and how to meditate on the
the specificity of my own
"They know that the < th> given the parameters I grew up under, how different everyone else is like, how every life is totally around"
I also mean just within the u_s like seeing someone grow in California is as different as someone growing in Maryland and then thinking about someone growing up in like Thailand or something it's nice it's pretty amazing
mhm
"Uh, okay."
hmm
I'm right here Ellie
um
Let's see.
uh
"Well, um..."
"It's been a while since I was on a trip, I guess"
One of the last trips I made was to
I mean it was a xxx like two years ago I went on road trip over the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing
"but I guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> I drove from Maryland to l_a this is before I actually moved here, but to visit new Orleans and new Orleans was just this whole"
"like, although it's part of the u_s it's like a total"
"It's completely different than anywhere else, it's so..."
unique the culture there is so unique and the mixture of Caribbean and French and all these other influences in as the American South is so
"So, um..."
"Unbelievable, yes, it's just unreal, yes, it's unreal, yes, it's unreal."
hmm
It's a difficult question.
One <on>um
- I don't know.
hmm
You know that I can give you back to this question you are able to
"Yeah, that's good."
Come back.
"Yeah, that's good."
That's what I just said.
Film
"You know, that's actually a question I asked myself that I knew I knew."
"I've had my whole life like phases of interest, so when I was how very very very young I was really in the first phase that I remember were keys and then tools as I go around collecting keys"
and then I would go around collecting tool like any kind of tool I had a toolbox my parents told me that I was a phase before that with which balls were like different balls
um
and then I was really in insects that collected insects and reptiles and so and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and
at a certain <cert> and anyway at a certain point I really got killed
like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then eventually in there I had told <to> I remeber someone that at the moment I'm interested in
"playwriting and and poetry, but finally I wanted to be interested in uh film"
"how I could somehow see the trajectory coming, but I don't remember what led me to this conclusion I just always think"
"I've lived a protected life as far as movies are concerned, I didn't let my parents watch a r-rated movie until I was almost like that in high school."
um
and uh and I never
Uh so I never saw a r-rated movie I was also very zimperish as I remember when I was
Pretty young maybe like six I saw star wars
the first scene in darth star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck
and so only a small scene very at the beginning and that like me freaked out and I had to leave the room so
I'm not sure.
"Yes, it is."
I don't know exactly how I got into the movie.
but
I've always been fascinated by
how people interact and what you know about acting and so and movies in general
I'm just...
To be a filmmaker to direct
and uh put <pu> joined
and do <ma> as I think directly I don't use mm that word so much because it I think I think it's more than like I want the opportunity to put together and make
Films
Uh or making movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it because I want you to know I want to participate in all
"all processes, but"
I guess the best parable for that would be a director
Director
It's much better if I don't live with them.
um
my
I guess...
It's funny you ask Ellie.
"I've been thinking a lot about it lately, I think I'm close to my whole family I'm closest with my father around I'm coming with my brother and sister you know how, but I don't"
when they're gone
"as my brother is in a foreign country at the moment, so I do not have the opportunity to talk to him, but how"
I spend more time with my dad than anyone else because I feel like he's the most like
from all my family he is the one who accepts and likes me the most
Thinks Positively of Me
"So it's, I've got like a"
a complicated relationship with my parents
I mean <mea> and my family in general
"Well on the myers uh Briggs personality test I'm uh I'm an extroverter but lately <late> as moved since, but I'm not like"
um
I'm not I would probably be on the scheme of the Extroversion uh or on the scale of the Extroversion sorry around I would be extremely introverted around
"I just see other extroverts and no matter who they are, they're able to like strike talks and I'm a pretty shy person I'm kind of like"
uh
or inhibited person perhaps to
So I like it
Until
"Yeah, I'm but I'm working on it I'm working on it"
"In the past, I'd smoke weed, but I stopped smoking weed."
So now I know I have a glass of wine and
Maybe you're watching a movie.
um
I didn't or maybe leave as it will depending on whether it's like a xxx when it comes to
"if it's a worn-out kind of stress, as if I were just like"
"then I'm what I do, but if it's a more like fear type stress, I could"
"go on a uh an intense walk not really practice that much, but I like"
You know competitive sports and hiking
pretty good
"Well, I always like to fight around"
I wouldn't call to fight to lose my temper.
um
I enjoy a vicious debate around
But I don't know.
as long as I want
Because I don't like to go back to personal you know attacks
in my arguments I try to keep it on topic
um
"and try to explain myself as well as I can, which can become frustrating because I'm not like the best articulator of what I think"
um
one of my weaker points I would say
"But the last time I had a heated debate, I thought that was the question."
um
"What happened, I forget the question that I had a heated debate"
hmm
last time I had a heated debate
I had a heated debate on
Uh the movie boogie nights
um
"I was <wa> I didn't lose my temper exactly, but I'm going to be as extremely passionate about"
"'Cause I don't think it's so good in a movie, but the two people I was arguing with said that it was like one of the"
how the best to get best movies <Laughter> why did they think it was the best movie
um
"They think there are some who are there, as I understand it."
they have a certain uh they think that the
"like all the stories in boogie nights that they have their own, like each of them could have their own separate stories that they just think it's a whole like"
Complexity of character in film
and
that somehow like
<sigh> um
"what they said, they said like the movie"
it's like xxx it's like the end of an era
That makes it like somehow like casino and there's this attention to detail of the in the different character like how they
how they interact in the action
um
Something like
uh
"Yeah, I guess,"
"I think the heated debate was about like that from there and uh like myself it's not like a bad movie or something, but it's"
the
I just don't think Dirk Diggler is like meaningful < mean> meaningful of a character like i
"I think how I get out I came out of the movie because I had seen it many years ago and anyway my opinion about it is basically the same, although as I remember"
"when I watched it again, I could reevaluate it"
"There's nothing bad about the movie, there's nothing articulable like articulateable, it's like solid sound acting, you know the direction is good, the camera moves cool"
um
that anyway it's really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
but it's meaningless to me it was like meaningless and then too and then there was that led us to discuss because a movie I saw recently that I really did what was django unchained
and they both saw this movie and hated this movie
"and then there was this extreme I think, the heated part of the conversation came like"
so in the movie django unchained
"around you django and django is like a kind he is a two-dimensional character, but I don't think that necessarily takes away from what the great"
the
The big purpose of the film is
and
And you have Doctor King Schultz who's this uh
who is like his mentor character and the person I was arguing with said that he
"was intelligent and because he was intelligent, he wouldn't have risked his life to save Django."
or how would have gone into this second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to save Django's wife etc.
and
"and the reason <rea> the reason that they have this argument that like either you buy that he would do that, or he wouldn't, but the reason for their argument is that a smart person would not"
Sacrifice for someone else
Him the [stri> who likes me so much
um
how who
How...
she her basic argument was that
Altruism <al> as altruism does not exist <exi> it was a very Ayn Rand type argument Altruism does not exist
The only thing you can do is serve <ser> as if the only thing people do is serve them themselves.
"so it's not quite Ayn Rand, but it's like the only people thing that people like all people are out to serve themselves, which I don't argue, like"
"Every decision has been like a mixture of altruism and just like even the altruistic kind of decision there may be like nuclei of self-interests there, but it made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor"
"in and like what, but how terrible is your life, if that's what your ultimate..."
"Purpose <pur> as if you were not like love and sacrifice for other people, so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate"
um
and uh
something like yeah and it's uh
"So yes, I think that's what I don't think I've necessarily lost my temper."
I think I'm losing my temper as more
um
as I just did
So <s> I would be so <s>
back to ad hominem like attacks
"Um, but I didn't like that..."
"Maybe I was as if I was criticizing <crit> as if I was criticizing her worldview, but it wasn't like"
"Well, you're an idiot"
"You know, it's like it's not like it hasn't turned into abuse."
"Yeah, I'm glad you understand."
"an event or an I don't know if I necessarily want to delete something from my memory, I would say a problem I have is not able to remember in as much detail as I want me to remember feelings and moments"
not
Stories around
as my life does not synchronize <s> always synchronous to a coherent story it is like this moment and this moment and this moment and this moment so
"Yeah, that's good."
the hardest decision I've ever had to make
"Oh, God, what are you doing?"
Could it be just one of the toughest decisions
hmm
um
like the choice between two things that it is like
I guess I have a hard time remembering a moment where I like to choose between
two options like no there is no such as Sophie Wahl Art Moment in my life
But I think the decision because I lived in New York for a while I went to school in New York and uh the decision to leave New York after I lived there for five years was a very difficult one.
and uh but I had to do it
for money reasons and because all my core group of friends
were either as abandoned <lea> were most of them going and going other places in the world
"and then uh the one other person I was close to was living with someone I couldn't get along with at all, so it was like this situation in which I didn't"
I either wanted to live with people I wasn't so close to or Craigslist or move home and I think
it was a tough decision to leave I had in fact it was so hard that the only way I could do it I had to justify it by saying that I would move back
to New York within one or two months
"which wasn't what didn't happen, but that was the only way I could"
Leaving New York
It was how hard it was.
or how hard it is
How hard was that?
um
It was hard.
<Laughter>um
it was it was yes it was just a very similar one
Isolating insulation <is>
Because also as if I had fallen <fa> as before at that time I had fallen in love with one of my closest friends
and uh
which had somehow gone extreme
bad
and so I didn't talk to her and I couldn't like the whole thing
"all on my list of friends who, like more <mo> closer to xxx she was it wasn't quite like her or me type thing, but that was the way that I somehow"
"I saw it at the time, so I didn't like it."
"You know, only socially isolated etcetera"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Well, lately it's been awful"
um
- I don't know.
"I like two, so I slept ten and a half hours last night."
this seems to be the length of time I have to sleep to have really vivid dreams
But before this night
so last not last night but the night before last and the night before I got four hours and two hours of sleep
Because I worked on the set and came back.
and either and I just couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason.
too much energy or something I don't know
tired uh
Very
not immediately I think first when waking up as I really enjoy being up early in the morning
"and I also stopped drinking caffeine as I had a little coffee in the last two days, but before the last two days I had no coffee in as three and a half weeks so"
um
I guess...
with caffeine in my system I'm ready to go
"Without caffeine, it is"
"I'm just quieter, I guess."
more introverted
since
"as in recent times as in, if"
um
"Change in my thoughts yeah I mean, I think if I had just moved here, there was a period of time like"
"anyway at the beginning, where the"
"the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx because I moved here because I have a group of friends here or a few friends, but I don't like a large number of friends"
and the pressure on
To get out there and meet people and find a job and that pressure was pretty...
Overwhelming at first and I think that I'm slowly like
to accept it...
"and move you know moves over it i i but not necessarily < nece> you know as if it is still there is still there the pressure is there, but I'm just"
you know
you know <sigh> you know <sigh>
"No, I'm just..."
Yes
the last time I felt really happy
Maybe we have to go back
um
I think the last time I felt really happy
was uh during the writing process of so last year I made a movie
co-written co-directed co-produced co-produced co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-directed co-direct
um
"and it was kind of like it still consumes my life, but I think during the"
Writing stages of the film in which we get up bunkers like
Eating breakfast
Bunkers down work really hard putting stuff on the thing like pure creative
Full energy around between me and the person who writes it and
and there's like probably a xxx a day I remember where only I remember going to bed and I was just so excited to work on what I was working on and and and working with the person I was working with and how
Just like
I felt like it yeah I guess that was the
The last time that was like
"anyway more than a year ago though, but I think it's hard to believe that I haven't really been happy since then, but if you have a movie like"
"you can't allow yourself to be really happy <real> especially if you do, you basically know yourself with <wi> with how xxx can't"
It's too much to do.
I'd say I'm very
Acceptance of <acce> as
Acceptance from other people
and I'm always very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic around
and
open <o> open <ope> like
enthusiastic about new ideas and open to new ideas and
"Yeah, I know."
hmm
um
I guess I wish I was less uh
uh
less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my
you know
everyday interactions and in my way
um
you know
Pleasure for life
To <sigh> yeah i xxx
I would change other things about myself.
I would
I don't know <Laughter>
hmm
really bad about me
um
I think there are numerous cases in my childhood where my
uh
as every single time there was a problem in school or some kind of
a kind of uh
Conflict with a teacher or something that my parents have always been
always on the other side of the court you know how never
I noticed.
or noticed when I got older that other people were other parents
"as if her child was in trouble, as if something was wrong with"
"as if her child was perfect, something is wrong with other people, but my parents were always the opposite, especially my mother, so I would say that there are a few cases in which"
To me was as accused or as you know
It was my fault when
as what I did like
"Yeah, it's just things that I couldn't like"
there's no yes I don't know
"Yeah, that's good."
"Ten years ago,"
Stay staked you know how I think it's about
I have a tendency to
"how I love <lo> love the fact that I have a tendency to really get caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and how to devote themselves entirely to it, but sometimes"
um
Ideas are too easy xxx I would just say as much as possible do as not
Don't decide that you...
will only do
"one thing to try, as I think I would have recorded, as some do learn to learn to learn the piano to read music, would be a big thing for me to learn to play the drums"
I would say I'd like to learn how to play drums and maybe more like acting lessons.
um
"I've always directed, so I've always directed actors and stuff, but I haven't."
It's only now that I don't know that I think
Don't...
"I don't know that's a tough, hard question."
That's it.
safe
Goodbye.
See you.
