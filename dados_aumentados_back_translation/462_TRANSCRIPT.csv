"Yeah, that's good."
I'm fine.
I'm from los closeles
mhm
oh around the weather <Laughter> the weather the weather the weather of the beach the weather of the beach the peace of the
Driving instead of public transport
and the sporting
um
I'm really
I don't know how much I miss it.
uh uh mm
"I don't know, there's not much I don't like about l_a compared to most cities I really"
it's my favorite and I've lived all over the world I love it I love l_a
Much
< slaughter>
"Yes, I've lived"
in Paris and I have been a lot around the world
It's just...
Fun and it's it's it's it's it's an explosion it's good to see new places it's good to
- We have to go.
experience all the
fantastic to attractions and and
<ss> and cultures
"I mean, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh"
I tended to actually do a lot of them around I would probably do them differently I think I'm more than one person developed now i
"I lived in Paris for two years, so I lived in Spain."
Spain was funny Spain it Madrid is a party city and then around
"And then that was all the work they were all work, so I worked, so it was..."
There's a loop you didn't really appreciate what was around you and then
"I mean, I'm still..."
I still love to go just to know you vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica I'm still just really
a moron for this kind of stuff
um
I guess Madagascar
was pretty much just
really annoying because it was about it in the eighties and
It was like you were seeing a lot
"Uh people who'd never seen white people before, according to the guy who's been driving us around, he might have lied."
"But it was just, it was annoying Africa was pretty much the best senegal and Madagascar yeah"
I'm in the process of getting an early childhood education.
"Graduation and then I got a little paralegal, but that was really just"
Just for the...
just to get the scholarship I didn't really have a concept of what I want to do now I really do
"I said, I'm supposed to rattle, I don't know if you guys were able to overhear, I really think that..."
The way in which the school system at the moment is all about it
It makes people in
in order to only
Just Uh Dog Eat Dog To you know I don't like the way
"people <peo>it I think it's so emptying the school system now and I feel pretty bad for everyone, so I want to try to fix that"
"that would be my dream job, so I'm excited that like I want to go in a direction I want to and yes, that would be my dream job to work"
with somehow getting to children on a more organic universe
"You know, uh trajectory"
um
"I think it could be done, I don't think it would be done about"
Some kind of...
Legislation
"Except here and there, I mean, it always comes to you knowing."
"Facade and farce itself anyway, but I think there are ways"
I have always reached children anyway and they have always felt where I came from and so
I think you know there are ways to talk to the system without even using the system
I guess I'm just a combination of the two I don't think
um
"I don't really know, I'm kind of I could even work out there could overcompensate some debauchery for what's actually shyness and vice versa, so you don't know,"
<Laughter> yeah
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's cool."
um
I'm definitely...
uh try to reflect and stay in a fairly clear space as often as possible
a lot lying right now I'm in transition so there's only a lot and I and I hang out with my dogs a lot
So this is
quite reassuring I'm not trying to do I'm not really doing something that's also
"tense, unless it's time for it like time to drive at a job or time"
"You know, go some things happen meetings and stuff, but otherwise"
"I try to stay in a rather relaxed room most of the time, so it's not like break and"
"But you know it, and I do."
"I miss <mi> I miss swimming I can't believe summer is coming, so I'm going to swim a few more"
"If I'm really outraged, it comes out and then it's me who's a kind of"
"Bad parts right now because it's a very hard time I'm fighting for my child, so..."
There are times when I'm just gonna blow up a storm just to get off some steam
"a little bit, but usually there's always..."
You know someone
"in the periphery that it gets and you know it's like this bumper sticker, if you're not outraged you don't watch out so"
"As a rule, some kind of reason can prevail."
"Oh well I mean, these are times when I just can't find Somthing in the car and but when I'm arguing with people, it was a lot of times when I'm flat out"
You know to sabotage or definitely just
if uh what is the last certain time good i
You know that I've lost my temper terribly with
the woman who gave birth to me because in many cases she is intrinsic
"I mean, she's pretty much a terrible person, so I recently lost my temper with her."
I felt like...
"I mean, I like it again, I think I said that just now I felt"
in a way
"Good, because"
I see.
You know what's contrary to not getting it
This is
"even worse, but I guess there's another side of the bank"
of
the thing to get to where
"You can be a little more constructive about it, it's like"
"You know, you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a terrible travesty, but then you have to figure out how to deal with the terrible travesty."
"but I mean, I didn't feel like I didn't feel like shame I really felt honest no shame I didn't feel I didn't feel"
There are times when I feel that it was stupid to lose my temper just because
"There are people trying to use this against you, that's all."
but I never feel really bad for
being angry about what I'm angry about
"When I was pregnant, I wish I had..."
"Like I said, I've been through it."
such an awakening upon knowledge when I was
It's like an undercover.
"that my respect has become a big issue, and"
"When I was pregnant, I ended up being so disrespectful in the place because I was a hippie on the beach for six years, so I always felt like I was being so disrespectful in the place where"
To I was ready to be when the child came that I
stormed out
"about what was a good survival mode before, but"
let me jump out of the frying pan into the fire and they had my child
so
"Yeah, that's good."
It sucks.
"Yeah, that's good."
"I don't want to erase anything from my memory, I may have consolidated everything and"
Working together
I don't know.
and integrated I don't want to erase anything from my memory
"Well, I got it right or I got it wrong"
< slaughter>
"Yeah, I guess the hardest decision was whether or not."
Characters around
"Sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and I should have said no, just let us go straight to court because the"
there's nothing wrong with me just
It may happen that:
Give a s_s_i check by bullshit with my mother and I would only have
did you know?
"Courageous enough to just go in there and do that, and instead, I sniffed out and made her mediation, and they tricked me"
Over-precautionary
It's
Horrible horrific bourgeois quality
Intrigue and sabotage is bad
It's okay.
Someone I mean
There was...
You know there was something.
some great people uh back from afar I didn't somehow
Really...
"a really great ability to build relationships, and I'm working through that right right now and I think that's a lot of why I don't have my son, but"
"as I have grown and developed, I have seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so this is wonderful and"
but otherwise you know a constant
"You know, contact with someone who's really good for me, it's been hard for me,"
come to this point
not so easy in these days at all
I'm so I don't
completely centered and then there were some
"Um, actually, you know that."
uh
People think it's funny to bother me or shake me as they pass by and so there was real harassment
and such things
um
I'm still pretty polyanna'd out I'm still forging ahead and trying to be as pleasant as possible
I'm tired and empty and a little frustrated because I know that.
I was kind of
that somehow I'm a little bit
"around my around energy and space is usurped <u> usurped and I can say, and I don't know how to get through that and past it"
no
no
um
There's I'm basically I'm very very happy pretty much
"Blissful person, but"
"In order to fight this battle for my son, I have a kind of trembling area that"
it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my street in childhood before I realized that I was such a happy person
"are thrown there again, so I go through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes, but"
"You know, during the day, I'm gonna think of something completely true and organic and I'm just gonna stare at something and wow that's beautiful and I'm gonna be reminded that I'm"
Pretty close to my mind so
um
I'm trying to stay there twenty-four seven I'm pretty spiritual in this way
"Um, um..."
uh
"Fun, I mean, if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me, it's gonna be pretty competitive out there."
That you know that's me is gone from you.
that I'm funny and that...
and the
I think that's bad that I'm funny and that I'm good and that I'm trustworthy
um
"just uh I'm I'm not necessarily changing, but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with"
And from the people who
to manage to:
to
Drain me
"I told you, I'm sorry about..."
to leave the place where I could have delivered my son even though I was
Um uh a kind of
Abuse
Piss off your mother <Laughter>
"I'm sorry, you know it and you like a lot of the <th>"
and and
"Yes and to open your eyes, look what's going on"
I am proud of my spirit and outlook and
My access to what's really going on in the world and
"my for alertness, of which I am only proud"
I as a person
All right.
You're welcome.
See you.
