value
"Sure, yes"
Thank you for asking me.
You know how about yourself
Oh awesome
I'm from Guatemala.
My parents moved here to the United States when I was three years old.
So yes.
mhm
"Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know."
"I haven't been there yet, but I haven't been to my hometown yet."
for ages
Uh just you know I have all my family here my mother my father my cousins aunts uncle so
"I've got my life here, so I'm probably"
"I mean, it would be nice to visit, but"
"You know it's just my curiosity that you don't know, I guess."
"Oh, all right."
"I love the people who are all nice, I love the variety you know, there are different types of"
People and you know the imagination out there everything is just great
"You know everyone's different, you know nobody's like him, at least on some aspects."
"Um, and I love the landscape I love, the mountains they're beautiful."
"You know, good for hiking you know, take the dog know the family you know"
"It's nice, it's pretty active yes"
Uh the smog <Laughter>
"I don't like smog, it's just..."
"You know, if you keep going, you know you can see it in the air you know, or"
"You know everything is clear the sky is blue <Laughter> but different from that, as you know and traffic <Laughter> No one likes traffic I think,"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, but..."
"Yeah, you know that pretty much l_a is pretty nice you know it's I like it"
um
"Well, I just studied, you know, I'm not exactly sure what I want to be, so it's just kind of knowing about you"
Here and there you jump through tires and so
not really
"It's just that I'm still trying to find my interests, I suppose."
so
My dream job hm
That's a good one.
"I love working with kids, so I'd say probably a child psychologist just because you know it's great."
you know what's going on in the young minds
And you know how we can help kids find a better way
"You know, kids make you know or help"
"You know, help them you know growing in a positive way I thought instead of going the wrong track"
"Yeah, that's good."
All I know is that you're helping kids.
"It's important that it depends on the situation I'm in, sometimes you know that I could be like super-going and just like you know"
and sometimes like it just I could be quite calm or something not and just make sure you know if I'm like in class or whatever
I don't really like it and there's everyone talking I just would prefer it just to
"Stay away from what you know, because I need something else to focus on something else you know there's a moment and time for everything I take"
"Yeah, that's good."
um
I like to kick my feet on the couch and enjoy reading a good book you know.
"You know, I'm going to see someone else."
galaxy or universe; or
Situation you know it's pretty funny that you just know
"You know, read and then just"
feel relaxed and you know that you feel good
"Yeah, it's just fun I love reading"
um
I'm not the best you know.
"You know, I'm trying my best, and I guess that's all I could do until I keep"
Better work at the end
But I'm not like the best
"I mean, sometimes I have my outbursts you know."
"But you know, I guess that's all."
I'm not sure haha you know
uh huh
That's a good question.
In order to:
I don't remember <Laughter> uh let's see uh
"Honestly, I don't remember, maybe"
uh
"Oh, my God."
"I don't know, <Laughter> I sometimes I'm very passive that I just let go like things, because I mean, what's the point of making a big thing out of things"
You know it so...
I don't know.
I'm not I can't be honest I can't tell you that <Laughter> at this moment
sure yeah probably come back to it
um
What are you doing?
"Well, I guess,"
"When I was younger, I knew I could have been a better older sister and I wasn't"
And that makes me guilty for sure
You know I could have been a better sister.
"Better role model <Laughter> You know, but I'm trying to do my best now, so I'm trying to do things better."
and it works <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
"I guess, huh?"
hm
"I don't know, I mean"
"I am the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life, so"
"If I delete something, it's just something from me in my present self or you know that would change and"
"I don't know, I'm pretty okay with the person I'm now I mean"
"You know, I don't think I'd change an event."
"You know, I'm fine with what"
They know ups and downs and good and bad that happened
so
"Yeah, that's good."
"I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel much."
but I'm kind of like a explorer I think I love how to explore
"even the smallest things, like when I walk, I walk away and you know, I find my way up"
"You know it somehow, and you just do it."
You know to travel
"I'd like to do that, but..."
"I don't know, only you know."
"always circumstances in my life, which"
You don't always know something that you know I'm marrying children you know and all that
So it's kind of the way you know it
"It'd be nice, I guess you know"
It'd be nice
"You know, I love camping, the way you know it takes a few days out there camping and you know fishing <Laughter> yeah"
um
"Uh it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice, it was just me and he you know, and it was like nobody and it was like nice because it was just in the middle of the forest with a beautiful lake and"
"You know, it was really nice."
It's just yeah
"Yeah, that's good."
Yes yes it was it was it was really fun it was like I'd like to do it again
You know right now.
"it would be great, you know, just going out there it's just I love the adventure of things and nature and just life and you know overall"
"Yeah, that's good."
uh
"It's easy, but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because"
"I don't know, just you know that I'm lying there and I'm just trying to sleep and I'm just like ugh, but at some point I do <Laugher> you know, I just like it probably need to be"
Position me on another side of the bed as sometimes I'm in the headboard and I'm like ah I have to go to the other side and
"Once I've positioned myself, I'll just go to sleep."
But I have to find the right position for myself.
"Yeah, that's good."
um
"I'm tired <Laughter> I get tired all day, but"
"I'm trying to shake it off, you know, and just like that"
Feel like a new day you know and just try to make the day I have as big as possible
"you know and then try to like it by sleeping at night, the day of <Laughter> you know"
"So yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just"
you know
"It's okay, I'm trying to do the best, I think."
"if not, then I just go to sleep all day sucking"
Of course.
Uh no <Laughter>

I felt good.
"Yeah, I feel really good."
"you know a lot of things in my life you know that I've got a really good year so far, so I'm very happy with that you know everything is"
"you know how good you are, you know"
"Yes, it is, except that I just came out of a cold and it was terrible, but"
this is just nature <Laughter> my immune system must work harder <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
To super happy was uh
when the doctor told me I was pregnant
You know that I
really really happy about it and I was just like ah you know that was really good you know
very excited and just reading what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and
"Oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time < laughter> I never really like uh you know, but yeah, I've been very happy"
uh
um
"I don't know, I guess just myself, I, uh, you know how"
"You know, I could know that you're just me, and that's what you know, but I can't really"
"You know, say, I have certain thing I think I mean, it depends on the person who meets me"
"to tell me I can't really tell myself how oh I am that I am that only you know, just try to be my best and try to tell me something good for other people, tell me, or you know compliment me or what not"
"Yeah, that's good."
um
<Laughter> nothing I think <Laughter>
"as I said, I am happy with the person I am just"
"And you know my mistakes or what you know, I could have every mistake people see in me, and it's okay, you know I'm okay with it."
Whatever it is right now
I'm not gonna do it.
I can't change for other people's preferences <Laughter> I only have one body and one life so yeah
"Yeah, that's it."
uh
"only my childhood with my sisters and my family, but"
You know you know you're learning from it.
"you learn from the past and you feel like hey you know, maybe I should be a better role model that you know for my kids and so my kids could be better models so the world could only improve."
um
only smile and be happy
"You know, whatever hard things happen, you know you're gonna get through them someday."
The only thing you can't do.
I don't know you can't.
you know
"You know, you might know the heartache, or it's whatever, but you know, as long as I'm alive, I still have to go on."
Yes <Laughter>
um
I don't know.
That's pretty.
huh most proud of
I guess I'm trying my best to be the best I could be and that's pretty powerful you know I'm
"You know, I'm trying to be"
you know
a better person every day and try to like
"You know, improve yourself every day"
as much as I can
"You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of."
as much as I can
"Very hard <Laughter> I won't lie about it is really hard, you know, because I can't say that you know it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good you know,"
"and you know it's always challenges and everything you know in your life, but"
You know it only happens sometimes.
"You know, hard you know, and sometimes it comes easy you know, after a while you get a lot of exercise and all is how you have a great day and you haven't even tried < laughter> you know,"
So yes.
um
you know
"loving friendly around you know adventurous I guess I don't know, I guess that's what they say <Laughter> I just know you know that they like"
"You know, but that's what I'm at least trying to be"
At least you know I'm trying to
always give a best foot forward
as much as possible you even know
"Sometimes, even if I'm having a hard day, I'm just like you know."
"You know, I just don't want to take it out on anyone or anything you know."
"Yeah, that's good."
around <Laughter> my ideal weekend
Usually I like to go to the park
"I sit like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree, where there are shadows and how"
my blanket out there has my dog and
how to read a book and you know sometimes
"If I don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them, so that's pretty nice, you know."
just sit there and just the air and the
"Noise, I guess because there's no silence, knowing the wind and the cars, and you know it's just great."
"Yeah, that's good."
awesome
Thank you for being welcome <Laughter>
See you.
