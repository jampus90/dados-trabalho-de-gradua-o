value
Yes
Uh does it okay makes it okay
"Um, northern Karolina"
yep
Almost four years ago
Um I graduated from college had an internship out here uh for a production company so I started this with a group of friends and then got work afterwards and enjoyed the city so much and work here since
yep
Uh probably three < th>
Mostly three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe a random trip there
mhm
"Um, it's..."
"I just started to get home, in the sense of that respect, where, like going home, now goes home, like going back to my family and"
"to see some friends, but I feel more"
I feel more than I belong in loose angels than I am back home
the food goes around the weather without saying uh
I like the resources there I like to feel.
I like that the things I want to do are much more accessible out here than they would be.
"in North Carolina, so I feel like I'm uh."
I'm capable of tracking.
eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than I am in North Carolina
"I mean, the cost of living isn't great, but at the same time, I always say that people like part of the rent have access to so much."
"Resources <resour> so many resources out here, so it's not even expensive like New York or Boston"
"It's not the worst, but..."
"uh and also I mean, it's a little annoying that every time I want to go home, it's a flight not a ride that I can't mean, imaginable < con> really conceivable"
"Go home for the holiday because it's a three or four day adventure and just not practical, so it's uh unhappy that I'm so far away in this regard, but"
I can't change geography.
uh
<laughter> I studied uh history and uh media science and production
uh yes I work as a freelance author and producer
In college I realized that I was pretty good at it and I knew there was a way to monetize that and I got out of here and worked a little uh in the
"uh public sector in the attempt, you know, just do these jobs this way and I realized I could"
"making more money have more control over my schedule and my life when I did it freelance, so I have to do it now for a little more than a year now"
I love traveling I try to uh
"go somewhere new for a good time, about all uh seven to eight months just trying to mix things up, so I was in barcelona only recently"
"and I plan, either vietnam or even back to Europe in the next few months so"
mhm
"I enjoy the break from the routine, I think while it's nice to wake up and somehow have a vague idea where your day is going, after a few months you can get a lot into that and you"
Uh pigeonhole I appreciate your thought process your expectations for the day and I love to wake up in a foreign country and just
Knowing that everything I do that day will be brand new and different from what I would do if I was in Los Angeles or
"and around our own routine, so I'm a big fan of it and I love the food, so it's great,"
just eat a lot of food I love in the places where they were originally created
"Yeah, sure I went to uh."
Barcelona as I said a few months ago and that was mostly because I had a girlfriend who lived there for six or seven months and she asked me to come out again and again
"and uh I finally I was at a point in work where I had worked so much for months at the end that I felt like I had earned a break, so I went there for two weeks"
"and yes, it was one of the healthiest wisest things I've done in a while, so I"
mm reminded me once again how important it is for me to at least travel and get out of the world
"I'm very extraordinary, I love talking and talking to people."
even virtual people
Oop
I lost you.
to relax me
listen and play music much I like to read uh I like to
go watch movies uh cook I cook a lot so I enjoy
Cooking around uh my girlfriend and I are uh currently separated by distance around so I haven't seen her for weeks and that can be very uh
"Sadly obvious, so I'll talk to her as much as I can, but yeah, just uh"
Um uh pretty simple tastes
yep
This is embarrassing is not
"To me I don't really have a lot of temperament so uh very good I guess I'm not getting really easily or quickly angry and uh, when I do it, I'm usually aware enough that I can"
somehow formulate how I feel and why I feel so and what
"I want to do it, so it's nice."
I guess I'm a pretty loose guy in this respect
"To be honest, it was probably a small thing, like"
Uh wrongly remembers when uh
something was done or like a date on something or like a fact was probably nothing emotionally heated
"and it was just about yes, I think it was probably about like"
try to figure out exactly when we went to San Francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as the other person
thinking the other person wrong remember so to know in you small or big situation it is very difficult for me to feel really angry
Uh I think in the classical sense of the word
To <sigh>
I'm trying to think that I'm not one who regrets it.
I just did a project.
like a movie and uh the subject had a little to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to publish it
I pointed out that I didn't want to send it directly to her because I didn't want her to think it was me.
"does to xxx her face, but I sent it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see things and I want to"
"Uh maybe that <tha> she could have misunderstood that as passive-aggressive, I don't know about"
"But yes, I mean, that's something I've been thinking about, but I don't regret it as much as maybe I could have just left it."
"Uh everyone else I wasn't sure if I should trip, unlike me it to them so"
only my thoughts there
The hardest decision I've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh>
"Uh, it was actually probably uh likely that uh"
ah I wasn't even making a hard decision with as I said with that same ex-girlfriend I mentioned that it was probably hard because uh I knew I had to uh
Break up with her after something happened and
"It was difficult because I took great care of them, but it wasn't difficult to come to the conclusion that I was"
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
"Enough with her, but at the same time it wasn't uh"
"the easiest thing that somehow goes through this process to get on a roller coaster that you are very aware of how mm will be terrible or frightening it, but you know you have to hit the roller coaster so uh so yeah, I'd say that's probably from new memory"
I was just...
a plethora of <Laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the best person for me so
as I said it was a it was I didn't have to uh I didn't have to weigh too much data to find out it was pretty clear signs and I have no regret about doing it now to
- I don't know.
yes I feel very strong then about it and I still felt very strong that I made the right choice now
"around <sigh> it may be, it can be hard, there are <b> they will make me feel it's either when I've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know I've started to train again, which is a great help"
"But I would say that when I go to bed at night, I never know how it's going to happen sometimes, sometimes I wake up in an hour after sleep and I can't sleep again or"
"I'm just gonna get up and get up regularly, so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks, but uh yeah, like I said, especially with my current girlfriend uh not around, like I said, she's a very"
"great source of comfort around like this uh around but she travels a lot for work, so it's something to have to adapt and uh"
"Uh sleep can be some that suffers from it, but uh in the same way I'm not someone who actually feels like I don't need too much sleep i"
"if I can get, if I can get four to six hours, I'm in pretty good shape on that day so"
um
Uh little timid I guess uh little more <mo> more just around
"Whenever I get out of a task, there's always the question of what I am, what's next, and I don't have the next one."
"To project set up, so it's always that nervousness around in the past something usually comes, so you can set the precedent of it usually works, but until it does, you are getting a little"
um
Uh anxious and it can be depressing because it's like uh
"You know that I have chosen a lifestyle that, while I have a lot of control and autonomy over my life, also weighs everything on me to do it, and you know, sometimes I'm around I'm very jealous of"
the idea that people are just waking up going out into an office for eight hours and don't have to think about this work as soon as they leave the office and somehow the dynamics of a
Group of people or enterprises
You wear it when it's a little hard while like me when I have a day off or when I'm a sick day to get no job done <Laughter> You know I'm a small company that has an employee
How can I handle this?
You...
"I suppose you mean, I guess,"
uh
"People I work with, how I work with the"
"uh maybe the better answer would be how to cope with this lifestyle and just I've gotten a lot more used to it, something that I'm still learning and finding how to"
"how to use uh as far as I don't just know how rewarding the work is when I do it, but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live life and"
"You know how I uh what is the appropriate way to budget finance, which is the"
"uh expectation I should have for myself in a certain year, which is realistic, which is hopeful uh and that's something I'm sure to take years and years, but I feel as long as I'm getting better"
then it is the progress right
Uh yeah uh definitely once and then probably me if I had gone back uh
"I had gone to high school, probably it would have been the second time, but yes, I was once diagnosed with depression, so I feel it's one of those things I have to keep an eye on."
"All my life, you know, I feel like a pretty happy person for most of it, but around uh, they have I hate as annoying as it is, but as they say, like with people who are very creative or people who tend to do a lot of stuff with the mind it is"
and I understand that it's a self-esteem thing because it's so hard to feel
To get so hard <har> or so easy I should think <shou> into your own head that
"That was within a year, so I probably felt"
Uh symptoms were there before it was somehow easy to figure out how ah you know it somehow happened again so I feel uh the symptoms again uh
and to go through these emotions and feel like I was okay in the beginning I had somehow hoped that it would be something I could work through myself
"But I realized it was just stupid for me to try the fight alone, so I went and see a therapist"
Uh uh really bad that's when I just couldn't sleep at all as if I might get an hour's sleep one night best around I wasn't sleeping at all
"had just no <sigh> uh no drive to do anything, whether it was as easy as brushing teeth or"
my apartment things like to clean this and just at the same time to be aware that it's like oh that's all in my head and it's not even like a
a symptom around
Uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression
"No, I'm just done. I mean, since I didn't graduate or anything, but I got to a point where I was like..."
um
I talked through as much as I could talk through and
"I had moved on to other places in my life, it was kind of good."
good work xxx especially as I said I was working on something I was really interested in I am now with someone I am very interested in
"and um, there's such a possible opportunity for me not even to worry about the symptoms and so much, now that"
Uh I felt like therapy wasn't necessary and also I just didn't really have the time to go with so much work so
"Oh, I definitely think you can have someone you can trust who isn't your boyfriend or family member who isn't"
"You know, have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or something like that is definitely something beneficial I can't imagine how someone could not benefit from that on a somewhat routine basis"
To <sigh>
I don't know that I'm a company <f> a kind of solid creditor that all these things like the things that can somehow haunt you are also for a reason like uh
My sister died when I was about twelve years old and she was younger than me.
And watching my parents see my father crying for the first time was a very
"Kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh I felt like I grew up a lot on that day, so it's also hard to see that and see how my parents had to deal with the loss of a child"
I don't want to forget these things because I think they're very integral to
How I cope with life and how I perceive uh
"Having difficulties and obstacles and the image of knowing my father on it is very human, because it is so simple, somehow"
"You idolize your parents, and I still adore my father, but to know that he's a guy like me, and when I get older, it's easier to deal with"
The man he is
So I'd be 16 or 6
um
"I like the idea that they always say you wouldn't worry about what people thought about you when you realize how much people didn't think about you, and that's really hard to tell a sixteen-year-old, and I don't know what it means to tell a six-year-old."
"But yes, I feel special when you're in high school until it's time for me to think you're living in Los Angeles today."
so much is trapped in how people think about you and I'm still very much when I find someone anyway is either upset about me or don't like it bothers me to a large extent or I hate to let people down so
I would like to come to a healthier place where only know that sometimes you just can't really control
"as people think about you, even if you have the best intentions in the world so"
"I'm a very compassionate guy, I'm here for my friends, I'm pretty selfless in this respect."
To have a good humor about things like having <Laughter> even with depression or depression I can joke about it's not you know I'm not morbid
Depresses more only that I'm aware when I'm uh
I'm low and uh I treat it as such and
"I don't know, I'm not trying to deny it, I'm not trying to like any of it, but I..."
I've got a I'm a I'm a pretty
"like practical person in this respect I don't think uh even though I'm depressed, I don't take it from people or I don't think people have told me that they don't even seem when I"
"mention that <Cough> has gone through like depression no one seems to like or don't mention it, I feel like if I go through it it's as oh everyone can just say and"
I'm just a smoking gun.
sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no I tend to wear it pretty well and uh
I don't lose eyes of uh
reality <rea> the reality of what I know happens so
mm
I was on a...
"my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to Spain for two, but she cancelled this trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and around"
Yes I know I <Laughter> I love her she's great around her is the coolest person I know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh
"So we got them for ten days and we just had how normal we get rarely normal couples time, as it always is, how oh I see you for five days and"
"Then one of us has to go somewhere to be normal for ten days, where we can just cook at home."
lying in bed reading books or something was great and uh it makes me so happy that I have
Someone I can do this with and it feels so practical and feels so right
um
I guess for xxx I'm a good guy like I know I know I don't know uh
"I don't think I'm kidding people, I'm not a good friend to have, I'm there for people I'm looking for people I care about."
uh about people and what they think about me and that's especially true for my friends and
I'm trying to make sure you know with a lot of my friends on the east coast I'm trying to carve time to make sure they know that I'm thinking about them and I'm calling them
and so I feel like uh for many people who am me as their friend
Probably one of their better in the sense that I know how much I appreciate and respect the friendships we have.
"Thank you, Ellie."
See you.
