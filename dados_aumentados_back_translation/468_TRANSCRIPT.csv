<sync>
"Yeah, I'm fine with that."
"I'm pretty good to feel a little tired, but uh"
Feeling pretty good for most of it
around redondo beach
yep
I like the beach I like the mountains
Love how to go surfing in the morning Snowboarding in the day
um
"I like walking in these mountains of Santa Monica mountains, to be exact"
I don't like traffic
I don't like people's overload here.
And I don't like it
the price of the cost of living in certain areas
I tried to really...
last year was the summer of
really street tripping and out with my girlfriend around
We want to go to Costarica this summer and hopefully to South America and then maybe even take a road trip.
see below in the south some of the southern states
"But I was in Canada, I was in Mexico and Ecuador."
was in different countries here and there
try to get out of there
"I love meeting new people, I love experiencing new things that try differently <diffing>"
various foods that are native to this area
and
It's just part of the journey I love to explore what you know.
this planet we call Earth
just recently we went to seattle and canada with a few friends and uh
it was beautiful we uh flew in seattle
and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and
on the way to vancouver canada and saw British Columbia and boy it was beautiful just
very lush beautiful trees the uh

was probably the uh
the trip we made to Colorado last summer
and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver
And we didn't really have a plan that we knew we knew about some people who lived there and...
only the day before we contacted them and had to tell them we were coming to the area.
and they were only shown great hospitality they brought us at the airport let us crash in their place for a few days we
Let's even use your car to explore the state and go to wyoming and
see
the neighbors in the north it was just a great trip great people and
it was just everything worked very well just every day there was something new and fun to do
"Yeah, that's good."
i uh i studied business administration
and uh economy at the moment
I've always wanted
own my own business and I thought management was a
a good uh foundation to build and uh learn more about it so I decided to just go into management
see the different aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and to
and then economy is just
just for long-term investment I really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and investment funds and
"start buying my portfolio up, so I thought economy would be a good way to make a long-term investment financially, so that's why I made my economy"
"Yeah, I'm really excited it was"
one of the best choices of my life
"Yeah, that's good."
I consider myself more outgoing I am
"I'm pretty friendly, I don't mind opening up to people and stuff."
I like to be outside like walking
"I like working at the gym, but..."
I usually like to be outdoors I love nature and just be outside
I just feel good.
of pretty good for most part I'm pretty gentle chill guy and when I get angry here and there
- I don't know.
"It only takes a few minutes and before I know it, I just blow about I tend not to hold on to things or stay"
"angry and resentment, just because"
"There is no need, life is too short for all this"
um
I can't even remember when I was arguing with someone.
I have no idea.
Probably when my uh
my brother and my girlfriend came in a little
little argument
like two birthdays ago and it's kind of embarrassing since
I wish I'd taken care of it.
"Right then and there, instead of letting it just stretch out as long as it's been, it's just embarrassing for both parties, I wish I'd only communicated with both of them and"
"said to them, you know, set aside their differences and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution"
But now it's just
Inconvenient
"Yes, it does."
the hardest decision I've ever had to make
Man who's tough
I don't think I've had too many.
Hard decisions to really say the toughest decision I ever had to make to
Maybe
not to Colorado for my undergrad
Two three years ago
was a little hard just because I kind of think what if
But nothing else was really too hard in my life that
was really so hard of a decision
I don't feel guilty about anything.
pretty good person I think and for the most part
I couldn't figure anything out.
something I could wish I could erase from my memory.
nothing to be really honest i
I love all my memories they are usually positive for most
I know it's kind of
"Strange to say for someone, but I've lived a pretty good life and"
I'm happy
"Yeah, that's good."
"I'm usually quite independent, so when I see her here and there it is."
we go through long times without contact maybe a few weeks sometimes even a month
"But when I see her, it's"
It's good that you know that I like to say hello and show them that I still love them and
"It's not like I don't want me to contact her, they could always contact me, but..."
it's good for most I think as a young adult
mm
the family of my girlfriend uh
"They were very positive in my life, if it wasn't for them, I would go in another direction."
Just because I didn't care so much about high school.
really long-term thinking
and uh just to see her and
what their family does and
"how they think differently, how with your higher education and how to go somewhere in life and what if you do these things, this is what it could lead to,"
And they were very successful they own their own uh
accounting practice; and
see that influences me to reach higher ones in life
"Yeah, that's good."
it's pretty easy for most of me just close my eyes and
Wake up in the morning
"I'm tired, sometimes I'm tired"
could feel that I'm a little drained and uh
maybe a little groggy here and there
And that's it.
feel pretty good for most of it a little bit
stressed just because the finals are uh next week
"and uh I want to do really well and only you know, close this last semester and I graduate in two weeks"
and
"for the most part, that's the only thing I'm really nervous about, but for the most part, I'm really excited about"
I'm going to be fired for a week after graduation maui I'm
"see what the future holds, where we will live <l> Me and my girlfriend will live and"
what other trips are planned for the summer I'm just happy to be finished with school for a while
"Yeah, that's good."
I have never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
I have never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>
the last time I felt really happy was likely to see my girlfriend graduation a few days ago she uh just graduated from nursing school on Monday
and uh seeing her go over stage and all that just because we've been together for six years and they're going through
the care programme for five; and
It's just
Seeing all the ups and downs is really good to see that someone simply strives through and achieves what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of them.
"Yeah, that's good."
Probably outgoing friendly
positive vibes all around
adventurous
loves sport
Team player knows how to be a leader here and there
and uh
is a little open sometimes
No not really for the most part
"No, not really."
just a little more motivated I used to be so motivated and right now I'm just
Maybe because I'm done with school right now and I'm over feeling that I just don't feel so motivated
but I just want to be more motivated and determined
Now and that's not
I'm not going that far now.
mhm
No biggie
<Sigh>
"Oh, man, I couldn't"
I can't think of any more time.
I dug two weeks ago.
that was a lot of fun
We went to Sequoia National Park and I went with a
for a r_t_m class it's like this uh recreation tourism management class and cave research was an elective subject and our professor was like a world-renowned cave specialist and he brought us to these various caves in uh
Sequoia and only
Me and these strangers or my classmates and getting really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and climbing back into caves through various rooms and slides
It was a lot of fun.
That was
"Yeah, that's good."
"Ten or twenty years ago, I'd say I'd focus more on school."
slightly less on the social aspects
and uh
somehow to hold with a sport just to see how far that could get you
To <sigh>
sometimes don't play hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> I mean through middle school and high school sometimes and around
And that's pretty much it now
I'm proud that I'm really proud that I'm doing my bachelor's degree and I'm
"Looking for a full-time job I work at a law firm now, so I have something to do for myself"
I'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person in the long term <w> Long-term thinking wise I'm a well-rounded person
"and I really want to explore the world, so I'm kind of proud that I've opened my eyes and now I have different perspectives and"
"really have an open mind for people and instead of judging them, you know it's freedom why not let them do what they want"
and uh
I am really proud to finally get my bachelor and hopefully go to my m_b_a in a few years.
safe
See you.
