value
Yes
um
pretty good type of
<Laughter> yeah
over los engeles
Yes
the thing I like about the weather
It's not easy to meet people
"Well, it just feels like"
"People aren't very out there, they're like the movie in the crash where people are just sitting in their cars all the time."
It feels like this
no
not too much
Development of children
"Well, I have a son and"
I wanted to know how to make a good mother and so I wanted to know
about the stages he would go through
eh and be able to relate better to him
mhm
I'm
I'm trying to start it again in the fall.
I'd like to write
All right.
I wrote some children's books.
and
I've just been researching.
"to get published in my books, it's just like two I've written so far, but"
They are
"pretty good, I got some good feedback from my review groups"
<Laughter> It's about
A little boy surrounded by people who are idiots and he tries to
not to become a fool with them
and <Laughter> it puts him in like a really
Scrubbed_entry
he walks through many moods in dealing with the people in his life
mhm
Yes
"I had a few problems with nervous breakdowns and at the moment my son lives with his father, so <Laughter>"
"No, I'm a single mother, it was the hardest thing."
I think in the world <Laughter> is a single mother <Laughter>
so
How can I handle this?
To <sigh>
Good now.
um
I didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so
that was the problem
It's so spontaneous
like the stuff that comes out of the children's mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and
only brings a smile to your face
um
"Good, when my son was younger"
once we sat just around the house and
he comes and he starts to do my hair and he says to me
Mom I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails
So you can go out and get married and find a friend <Laughter> so
"Yes, it's quite spontaneous things like that happen"
that my child tells me that I don't have to be single anymore
the most difficult <sigh>
I don't want to mess it up
I feel a lot of stress and pressure
the
Every little thing will make a difference and make matter
in what kind of person my child turns out
and
so
There's a lot of stress on yourself <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's good."
Definitely
um
hmm
I think
I'm different from my mother.
because I'm a little more tolerant for this spontaneous interaction
I appreciate that you know I'm welcome.
I'm getting to know who my child is now.
and
"don't try to mold them into someone I want them to, but just"
see how they will be the best
Child that they are the best adult that they can be without
to shape them necessarily in this direction
to another person <Laughter>
so
Say it again.
Who is someone who has a positive influence?
To <sigh>
mm
I don't have anyone.
It's like the
All right.
All right.
"I tried to meditate sometimes, but I don't really hold on to it"
often enough
um
I tried.
"to go for walks, but I don't always do that"
And I don't always stick with it
so
"Yes, it is."
I'd say:
I'm
slightly less than average importance
that I'm getting angry
more than most people I think
hmm
last night
<Laughter> but it was on the phone I was arguing with my husband
We have my sister who lives with us.
and she lives with us in a very small room with
a small apartment I should say
"And she's got four people living in a room, so..."
it's kind of stressful it's really crowded
And my husband is stressed about it
and
"You know, I'm just saying to him that"
I told you when my sister moved in.
then there was a mess in the house and she'll ask for things you don't really want to do
so my sister <Laughter> so the house is chaotic and it is crowded
And every day they ask for journeys and my husband
He's...
Avoid coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't want to be there anymore
And I'm just saying that
He'll have to find a way to deal with it because
"he asked for him, in my opinion, for <Laughter> so <Laughter>"
hmm
It does <Laughter>
oh
"I've got tons of them, but right now."
What comes to my mind is to lose custody of my son.
um
Now like
I had a fight with my stepmother.
and
my step sister for a long time over
my son and how they treat him and how I want to treat him
as if they had no limits
and I think borders are important to find out who the adult is who the child is
They had my child command her around and all.
"In any case, because of this"
You will testify in custody against me that
"Yeah, they'll say I'm not a good mother."
Because I believe in borders and we have very different
Ideas about raising children
"She's my stepmother, she's my father's fifth wife."
and
She's
it's not really far from
how I grew up and I want to raise my child
"similar to how I grew up where you are, we had some independence and we had some limitations and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us."
and
with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants to run wild
and have everything he wants
"and that's okay if you're a grandparents, but the problem is that I live with them sometimes"
"And when I'm in the same house with them, they should follow my rules."
and not
try to go and break all my rules
"Yeah, that's good."
at this moment <sigh>
only really frustrated because they don't listen to me
I feel
disrespectful I feel
how invisible
I feel
Only angry
the
they take away my right to parenthood and it's something I really worked hard to do
I went to school and studied child development
I've read all the magazines and I've read the books and I'm really <Laughter>
"I know what I'm talking about, I feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting skills."
and
to have these people who have not done the same thing and have worked as hard as I must be a good parent
Try to tell me I'm a bad parent
It's really
uh
"hard to believe, so I feel very disrespectful"
um
Unrecognized angry frustrated
all these things <Laughter>
um
I'll take Benadryl to help me sleep
And I'm
so
"My doctor gave me that she gave me Benadryl, that I could take it to help me sleep."
and last night I cried
before I went to sleep
so sometimes these thoughts begin to run through the head at night when you are in bed
but I tried to push her out and then I got up and I took my Benadryl so I could go to sleep easier
"Yeah, I always think about my son."
as I wish he were with me
and how unfair all that happens is
And as I don't deserve it
to take my son away from me because I'm a really good mother
you know
"and I'm too hard for myself, so"
but I'm a good mother and I feel confident that I'm a good mother
I just...
"I don't really have the money to take care of my son, like my son's father, who has more money than I do."
and right now I'm trying to agree to it because
I know he can do more for him.
Financially than I could
But that doesn't mean I'm not a good mother.
hmm
I'm pretty depressed I'm on antidepressants
um
I'll take wellbutrin.
I've been with you for a few weeks.
"I think they're working, I don't know."
I'm not like
I'm here today and I'm dressed. I've done it and I'm here today.
not so bad
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
my husband complains a lot he says
I'm not the same person
that I was when he married me
he said I was funny and I was positive and
I was all those other optimistic things that another thing he told me on the phone last night and < sniffle>
and
"I'm not those things anymore, what's true, I mean, we got married a year ago."
and then my son was taken shortly afterwards and it was just like
a shock
and
I was just trying to get back from it.
But it was hard.
I thought I had a problem before I found out
found out what
oh
um
"yeah like crying a lot like I'm crying all the time <sbbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry I'm just crying thinking about crying, but"
How to
my family would invite me
on family events
and I'd go and just cry because my son wasn't there.
or by
I don't know.
It's just the whole crying I think
"and as I said, my husband"
lets me know that I'm not the same person
so
He's disappointed.
"and I feel bad, even that I'm not the same person he knew, I also feel bad about it."
another thing I feel bad about
you know
"Yeah, I'm trying."
I feel like therapy is useful
um
"Yeah, it's nice to talk about your problems that I go in there and cry every week."
so at least I have a fixed time every week where I can go in and cry <Laughter>
um
"that's what I mean, it's a liberation, able to cry sometimes I feel better after"
um
"Yeah, that's good."
and she helps me make decisions you know
Help me to be more proactive in my life
um
All right.
I'm looking for
Jobs and such things and they give me ideas why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about it
"You know, and then she said something about"
Why don't you go back to school and
So I went and applied to go back to school
You know I don't
much with my life and
Sitting around all day doesn't help my depression either
So I'm trying to find a job and I applied for college
in autumn I was accepted to dominguez hill
"So I can go back to school in the fall, now I'm still looking for work, but she's helping me with something like that just to give me ideas."
that life is not over <Laughter> that there are more that you know I could do
live with life yeah
Everything is always
Bittersweet
um
I don't know.
the last time I was really happy
I don't know <Laughter>
my ideal weekend
oh
"I don't have much money because I'm not working right now, so my weekends are really just spent"
Maybe read
But I can't really
i
"I can't pay much attention when I read, so <Laughter> I have a short attention span that I can only read a few chapters <Depth Breath> around"
But lately I've been saying that this is what I've done is reading
something I've read
xxx
All right.
I like to go to u_s_c
"they have these nights, where"
they have things like book signings or poetry and art called visions and voices.
So I like to go to their events <t>
and I usually enjoy this
um
About two weeks ago
around deborah harkness there was a book caption for
a discovery of witches
"and as I said, I'm trying to be a writer, so I'm trying to go to the book captions above all"
and see what it's like to be an author who
Conversation with a lot and signing books <Laughter>
my son
I don't have any friends.
my best qualities
um
I'm smart.
I look good.
um
I'm really...
and like a hard worker
I'm dedicated to self-improvement
um
That's all I can think about right now <Laughter>
All right.
All right.
Goodbye.
Press the Summer now
