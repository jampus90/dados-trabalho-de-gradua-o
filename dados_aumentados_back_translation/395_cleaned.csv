over a year I taught English there and around <sniffle> I moved around to different parts of Greece and uh really had a great time
I think...
only with my group of friends I met there and go through with the experience with them
I think one of my most memorable experiences was making Elafonisos with everyone in a car and spending a fantastic time.
"Yeah, that's it."

Rest in the bed
"watching a movie in bed, this is probably one of the things I like to do to relax"
I think very good <Laughter>
It was probably with my friend...
Uh with regard to money questions
I must feel guilty because I don't generate as much income as I need now.
I just have a few fights in my career.
and financially it will be very difficult
"Yes, it was difficult, but I have worked very hard to fix that <sigh>"
"All right, I'm here and I'm doing this focus study that I'm doing to generate a lot of things to make more money that works harder but looks for other ways to generate money outside my career."
um
Probably raped

I felt like I was.
<deep breath> felt stressed and worried
I don't seem to have a problem with that <Laughter> I seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night
mhm
around grumpy and and lethargic and around in the morning
I wish I were going around differently.
um
I really can't imagine anyone right now.
The hardest decision I've ever had to make
It was probably to decide not to have a child
"Well, I was pregnant and..."
was not sure if I should continue the pregancy around
and that was also due to financial burden and
"the father with whom I was involved did not want the child, so I made this very difficult decision"
hmm
I know when I went around Cancun to go on a holiday around the new year around new year period New Year holiday
I felt absolutely fantastic I felt happy I felt relaxed around
I felt as if I had no worry in the world temporarily
um
Eh free
I wish I could...
be a little stronger and more confident
Definitely more confident
I'd say I'm a wonderful friend.
um
"If I love someone you know, I love her very much family of friends."
Friend
So I think it's good that I'm very loyal as a friend.
"I'm honest, I'm taking care of people."
um
"I'm fun to be with, so I think these are some of my best qualities"
<deep breath> about my relationship with my family around my father is not so great
"My parents were divorced when I was young, and he was somehow in and out of my life you know forever."
Mostly from
"So that's not fantastic, but it's something I'm used to, so it's not"
"as painful as it would have been if he had been there and then I lost him, but it's still..."
"It's still not the best situation, I mean, I still wish this could be fixed somehow"
Scrubbed_entry
So there are good and bad relationships in my family
Scrubbed_entry
someone who's been there for me since I was very young
and was always incredible and I love her so much
<deep breath> ten or twenty years ago
"I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun, so I don't have to work so hard now"
I am very sorry that I regret not taking my career seriously earlier
Because now it's...
It was much harder.
um
I think it took the kids to the pier and spent a wonderful time with them
and make her happy
this was probably a great time at one of the best times in the last weeks
Scrubbed_entry
and uh
And they're great kids.
"No, I think they're a challenge."
"It's harder because they're stepchildren, so there's some..."
Times when I don't know exactly how much to be involved and how much to not be involved
"But I'm very happy because they're really good kids, they tend to fight a lot, but..."
"but I, but it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it"
mhm
To make it a conscious effort
not to
<Laughter> not to punish her or to overstretch her
"I make a conscious decision not to yell at her as I was screamed, I was often screamed as a child."
"and it was really it was really difficult, so make sure I don't do that"
I think I'm very proud of the fact that I was able to
Traveling to the world around
and live in other places many other places around the country and around the world
and
the fact that I have learned several languages
um
and the fact that I am able to keep
really long long relationships with my friends
Thank you.
Goodbye.
