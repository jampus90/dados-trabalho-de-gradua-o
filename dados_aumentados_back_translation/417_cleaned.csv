value
Yes
I'm fine.
Uh los narrower <Laughter>
I don't know <Laughter>
um
"It's kind of dirty, but that's to be expected from a big city"
"To my last class I took was a sociology class, I'm not sure where I'm going with school, but I'm thinking about sex education"
I think it's a really important job.
I feel like
"Uh, because there's some kind of uh"
stigma I think about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies
So I feel like it's a very important job for
the world <Laughter>
I don't know <Laughter>
no
Lack of resources
"It depends on the people, but I would say that I'm generally more shy."
of course with people I know well
as if they were closer to me I am more going away
to play with my dogs
uh
"I don't know if it's a nice day, I'm going for a walk."
um
"if it's not a nice day, or if it's cold or something"
uh maybe you see a show on t_v i like or read a book or something
I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temper.
I can't remember thinking the last person I argued with
was my friend
"Probably last week, but I don't even remember what it was about <Laughter>"
um
"I don't think I feel really guilty about everything I would say I regret things, but I think there's a difference between guilt and regret."
as I think guilt is more like a bad feeling
But regret is like
You should have made another decision.
I think this can help you in
better decisions to make in the future while guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <Laughter>
um
I don't regret doing better when I was in high school
um
uh
I don't mean getting better grades
um
I regret uh
how to engage with certain people in the past
"But I mean, I'm not sure <Laughter>"
That's what I'm thinking about right now <Laughter>
hm
um
"Yeah, I mean, in the past."
"Yeah, I could have done it."
different decisions
"I mean obviously some things that you know you're not quite in your control, but I won't feel like I'm not gonna regret things that I had no power over so"
um
I don't know if I want to erase it from my memory.
but
I wish it hadn't happened to me when I was raped.
<Laughter> I can't imagine tough decisions.
hm
"I can't think of a ""laughter."""
hm
I'm not sure <Laughter> I can't imagine any
I have a pretty good relationship with my family.
uh not
"I wouldn't say I'm really close to my mother, but I mean, we get along well."
"and I'm very close to my sister, we're basically best friends"
um
hm
I think my mother was a positive influence in my life
uh
because she was always able to take care of me and she always
I didn't mean she did it.
"like mistakes sometimes, but I think she was always there for me when I needed it"
And she did her best to educate me.
I think she was a great positive influence
It's been easy lately.
"sometimes I have trouble sleeping, but uh"
lately I have had no problems
um
"it depends on how long I have gone without sleep, I can only"
be somewhere from like
to like groggy around
really at the edge
and how to
extremely tired <Laughter> I don't know
I felt
Pretty good I uh
"I'm kind of like general fear all the time, but it's not as bad as it's been"
in the past
so
mostly felt pretty good
I think I really felt
more happy in recent times
I wouldn't say that all the time I'm really happy I'm usually just kind of
For example:
um
"neutral, but I have the feeling"
more recent positive
I'm not sure I was diagnosed with p_t_s_d.
um
uh
I know that I uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like
since I was sixteen
Ahem for depression
and I think my first psychologist I saw for a few years
"thought I had p_t_s_d, but I'm not sure if she"
ever made a diagnosis
um
I'm not sure <Laughter>
uh
I am <Laughter> I don't know
Yes
um
"It's helpful, uh"
talk to someone and have them somehow
um
you can take part in
talk about something so you can figure out the thing that your
Feelings about things I think for yourself or how it helps to talk to someone because you can figure out why you feel a certain way about something
"I mean,"
"I think you can do this on your own sometimes, but..."
uh
Talking to someone helps me think
um
hm
I'm not sure <Laughter>
um
I'm not sure <Laughter>
um
I'm not sure <Laughter>
uh
I think I'd spend it most of the time.
at home
but it would be sunny outside and I would go outside a little
and I would play with my dogs and
uh
I'd probably have my friend over.
um
I'd eat food I like
like just food I like my favorite food around
Clock
Movie or t_v show that I like
um
only
"Kind of have like a relaxing time, but"
That's nice.
mm
"I'd say to myself, uh"
to make it better at school because I was kind of an underachiever during high school
and I ended up at community college going like this because I want to
Lose type of interest and then
Uh not doing well
or as good as I could have
"So I'd say to myself,"
do as well as I could at school because I feel I'm able to do too much more
when I do it
and I think I would have easily received a scholarship if I had done well in high school
So I'd say good at school
probably warn me of one or two people who
Turned out not worth my time <Laughter>
um
hm
um
I think I'm
"proud of me, for not"
be
bitter and for willful
to
uh
"Well, I'm kind of bitter I guess but I guess I'm proud of myself"
for not being selfish and wanting
"To make the world a better place, because a lot of bad things have happened to me and I try to stay instead."
I'm trying to
um
or I want to
to make things better for other people
and as much as I want to help I think to empower people to make their lives better
See you.
