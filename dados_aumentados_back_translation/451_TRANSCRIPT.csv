value
<sync>
Yes
"Okay, except for this laryngitis,"
Uh cleveland ohio
in uh
"seventy-nine, I think it was <Laughter>"
mhm
um
once a year
something like that or less
There's still a lot to do here.
um
You're a little more narrow-minded.
back there and Republican <laughter>
around good original show business
but probably to get away from uh
cleveland
it was very difficult at first
"I'm not used to changing, I don't like changing."
The Commission's position is as follows:
uh meet new people and
Finding out how to earn a living
All right.
I like
the different ways you have different health awareness
the movies around
"the variety of things you can do, the places you can go the weather"
To drive the traffic jams
some of the
superficial attitude
the meaning of
"Well, not much, but I do."
I just came back from vegas
visit relatives we met there
And I'm going to Mexico
Next month
um
see well the different
Cultures as in Europe have been
GREECE <p>um italy
um
"I like going to places like Mexico, where it will be sunny and just lying down, I went to last year I went to Arizona"
I've never seen Sedona who was really uh
an experience
Purely peaceful
on sedona
"Yeah, that's good."
good sedona is a very
energetic place and I thought it was desert like flat
"A kind of desert that looks, but it was very rocky and when you land in Flagstaff, there are these beautiful"
Uh jaws
and the height is high and coming in sedona was very beautiful and
and after a day the pain went away in my back
that I had there for months
"So, and you had this, even though we went to bed late and got up early, you had that energy."
So it was really...
very mystical
in life <Laughter>
or in Sedona in life
um
Well-being on stage in Boston
And that was great that I loved doing that.
um
just to be with friends and laugh
are some of my highest moments when we laugh hysterically
"Well, um..."
"I don't know about a particular situation, but when I decorate for special events"
and
I worked regularly with someone and we just found humor in everything and
Just laugh and
and
"I can't imagine a particular situation or what we laughed at, but"
only to be with someone who is in harmony with him
my sense of humor and uh gets
my jokes and
You know I get his and we're
Just to enjoy this moment
Speech and Drama
I graduated from college.
"No, not now."
I was always interested in
"Music comedy when I was a kid,"
sing with to records in my living room
and I've always been in choirs
"at school and then, if i"
I went to high school and went to the drama club.
and I've always had an interest and I've always had an interest
a great personality and
Good <Laughter>
I don't know if I have a dream job anymore.
I'm sixty and
I don't know if I
continue to strive to do something
at the moment I would just rather not work <Laughter> and just
um
"relax and travel, but..."
I like being creative
in some way I can like independence
And I kind of did it this way
I'm fine.
um
I'm watching my favorite shows I recorded.
and I'm also a Buddhist for whom I was a Buddhist
around gosh since nineteen eighty-eight
And I'm
a district leader in my community
"and we have meetings and that really helps,"
center me and bring out my higher self
So when I get tense or nervous I get chanted
sometimes okay sometimes not
much yes yes <Laughter>
"less and less, although it has happened less and less"
But...
"Yeah, sometimes he does."
It's...
Creating Difficulties
All right.
I can't <c> <sigh>
I can't remember an argument that I remember getting angry like
"was just when I was on my trip to Vegas, I was driving"
"and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and I stayed in the left lane, but when I got off the highway it brought me to the ramp that went back to the highway"
about four miles out of the way and I just
I got very angry about
30 seconds and then I had to
"Calm down and say okay, so we'll be late, you know I had to talk myself out."
"So it wasn't really a fight with someone, but..."
I felt somehow
bad that I overreacted
um
You mean in my life <Laughter>
many
Yes
um
"God, there are so many <Laughter>"
I just wish someone would tell me that I'm disappointing.
Information
For example:
they won't use me for a job or anything
that I
to take a position which:
um
"I'm gonna find something better, it's okay and"
go on instead of feeling what's wrong with me
and
You know I did something wrong and then I get angry with her and
You know that
Whole uh
Thinking process that really doesn't help the situation
and I do it more often
but i
Since I started singing
But you don't know that.
I'm not always in my high life state <Laughter> where
I can do this.
I find a lot of situations <Laughter> difficult to make as you know what
to buy TV or something <Laughter> but to
um
I guess <gue> I think the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences
and
um
or to leave my comfort
Area <z> Place
when the decision meant that I had to leave my comfort place
that would be a very difficult decision for me
and probably leave a relationship
"very hard, because"
You know I'm dependent on this relationship.
so that I usually
Live it from til
"It's for you, you know, it's"
they go or something you know it's very hard for me
to make this decision that this is not right and I have to move on
So what I usually do is I don't make the decision
And in the end I suffer
but longer
so
mhm
we can continue
um
All right.
It's hard.
Because I don't know if it's because I'm in pain.
in my back
and neck
but
"It's difficult for me,"
"Stay asleep, I would"
I don't get it.
a deep sleep
um
but
for
"Well, I'm so okay it's hard to say because right now I'm having this cold and I've got it for two weeks, so I took Nyquil"
And that's how I fell asleep
I've...
sleep better because it
"but last night I woke up on cough, so it's hard to say"
But before it all happened
I was...
"it's hard to find, to sleep"
and that's why I'm tired during the day and
Sometimes I'm groggy sometimes I'm irritable
"but yes, I'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or"
emotional things or or or not
"I'm sorry, could you repeat that"
I have studied changes in my behavior
Uh no <Laughter>
I had not taken
no
mm mm mm
"Oh, I was happy last week <Laughter>"
"Well, I..."
I wanted to...
vegas up to
meeting my family was my
my family flew from cleveland to
Uh there we have a
a relative in uh vegas
and I drove with my friend
And it was my brother-in-law's 70th birthday.
so
we all went and
had a good time in vegas
"I mean, I fought through my cold, but"
but it was fun it was nice
Good <Laughter>
You think I'm funny.
You feel like I'm telling you what it's like
um
they all understand and they all say they understand me like this
"People who don't understand me, I sometimes don't think they know how to take me"
'Cause I'm gonna
I'll say something sometimes comes to sarcastic
but only <ju> that's exactly the way I talk
so
for my...
the
Anger that sometimes pops up inside me
You know I'm just...
"But even though that really made me do it, I think"
a lot of the person I am you know all your
Experiences make you what you are
and how to deal with it
makes you who you are and when you don't have them
Lows you don't really know what Hochs are
So I don't.
"I can't really go back and regret you know I wish certain things didn't happen, whatever"
but really what matters is today and now and how you deal with today
and I wish that well I can not wish that I know that I will have less of these
moments in which I
"Just burst out, you know that anger or something"
I just wish that would happen more less
that the anger parts would happen less
And they are so
I guess it's going to be <Laughter>
less
um
Don't give up hope of living at the moment
and
"Everything will work, everything will work"
and if you think that
then you really have nothing to fear
um
the fact that now
and for the last twenty years twenty several years I have
I cultivate myself and I'm too <be>
more than
Compassionate Man
and I'm able to
uh
<ss> Understanding people better
and see that you know that their suffering also suffers
and
the
if you are treating people
out of this respect that they
they also have their problems and they suffer with their problems too you are able to live a better life because
"you don't let it affect you, you don't take it personally"
and at the same time you become more compassionate and more compassionate
you are happy and your life is happy
All right.
