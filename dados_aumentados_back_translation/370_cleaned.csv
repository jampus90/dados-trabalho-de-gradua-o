value
"Yeah, that's good."
Thank you for asking me how you're doing.
I grew up from here in l_a in the San Fernando Valley
"Yeah, that's good."
"Uh <sigh> Well, I like the variety of people the different types of food that you can eat I like to"
"the outdoor opportunities that I grew near the hills, so I did a lot of hiking around"
Camping is pretty close to I have snowboarding around I like
the familiarity I think and you know it's a big city and you know I'm pretty familiar with living here for so long that
I'd say I like that too
Uh the long commuting also you know for short distances around
And then you know it gets really hot in the summer sometimes so you know
"that before I could bear to be a little bit cooler when it comes to its peak heat, but"
That's all right.
wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a big question i <laughter>
I think my dream job would probably uh you know maybe be able to travel and somehow
"make money out of him profit from him you know do business of traveling, but"
"It's almost an unrealistic dream, because I don't know if I would really do that, but if I did,"
"If I had to choose some kind of dream existence, you know that travel is paid to meet new people and try new things."
and able to make a living out of it would be pretty funny
"well I like as I mentioned what I like about l_a I like to try different types of food different kitchens, so I think authentic cuisine in different places to try and meet different types of people who would see different ways of life uh"
"anyway, what I like about traveling around I like to experience new things around"
"I think that would be nice, you know, although the fact that I said I like the familiarity of l_a there is also"
"Fun in discovering new things, so I think traveling <tr> When I travel, that's what I like to do, just check out new things around"
So I'd like you to know if I could live with doing that would be great
uh one of my trips okay well let's see the last
Travel i i
taken to
lemmi think of a <on> yet an exciting journey around
"Now my family is from Eastern Europe, so one of the trips I made with my parents when I was 14, I was too"
"Austria hungary and Romania and uh you know that some of these old castles to see <ca> I was a couple of times before, but I was when I was little, so I didn't really remember too much and I didn't really do things quite the same as when I was a little older"
So I need to see that you know that my family is old and you know the hometown that you know we have a family.
For example:
Tomb so I got to see that then only these old buildings and only the other kind of life
"I really liked that you know to see my parents old friends, you know, and"
So that was pretty funny it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from me
"My home environment, you know, I went in the middle of the school year, so it was like going to America suburban from you."
Travel through type of uh you know with these old trains and see these castles and these old as well as hundreds of years old cities and
"I don't know if it was for everyone you know, I don't know if it would be great for everyone, but I really enjoyed it"
Uh that's a good question I'm doing <sigh> uh I'm probably one of the things I'm doing is either turn on like a repeat of a sitcom used to i to make the office much so
"I kind of know when this is on, so I'm gonna do this, that you know, just some kind of zone from a little too uh you know how"
familiar characters and and hear jokes that are still funny for some reason or around
"Maybe how to eat a little comfort food you know I'm not trying to eat too much fast food at all, but uh"
"As in n' out I really like going there, so if I need to relax you know it's once every few months maybe I'll do that"
Uh or I really like to read it around especially like uh I'll read the events of the day you know that this really
"relaxes me for some reason, even if it reads about something that is going on somewhere in the world a conflict is going on, I will still read the headlines and"
I really like to know what is on this kind of centers me around so I really enjoy that this is something I do to relax
"I'd say I'm pretty good at it, although I don't think my nature makes it pretty easy <eas> that pretty easy I don't <Laughter> I'm not getting very excited <up> excited about just so"
It's not a big challenge to control my temper.
"Yes, I don't know <do> I don't really have anger problems I it's difficult for me to get angry, uh so I don't"
I don't really have much trouble with that.
The last time I argued with someone was probably <sigh>
I don't even know that I have my little disagreements that you know I'd have uh with family or friends about
"Things, but just a full argument i i i i can't even remember that it's been years since I didn't really argue too much, I'm trying to avoid conflicts"
as much as possible in my personal life
"really see something to be won, and I kind of uh naturally repell away from him, so I don't"
I'm sorry I don't have much to say about arguments.
something that I feel guilty about saying that you sometimes know that I'm anyway sometimes I don't really care about
I have the feeling that I may not have made the most of my potential in life I think that I could definitely do more despite the fact that I work a lot around
I feel like I'm getting more and more ways out there that we miss I feel like you know sometimes downtime I feel a little guilty about it because there's always something I could do that I'm not
"Even if it's just the laundry I took out of the dryer that's sitting there, or"
"I run late, I really don't like running late, although it happens more than I'd like and I don't know why I feel guilty that I don't like to keep people waiting"
"wait because it feels like you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs, which is obviously not true"
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
for nothing comes to mind immediately
"Now <sigh> the last car accident I got in i, it was a few years ago I think I wish it hadn't happened that I wish I could have deleted it from my memory, but I anyway"
was
"I thought the cars in front of me would go, you know, at least for a little you know, ten fifteen feet, but it turns out that they had stopped them, so it was a < deep breath> you know xxx slowly"
"Heck-end collision, but it was still very unhappy, I was just uh you know it felt like I was watching a second and in the next second you know I was just like"
"to reach something in the passenger seat and then I banged in front of me in the car and [deep breath] uh I wish that hadn't happened absolutely uh I know <kn> I know it's a little thing, but"
"it was just really unhappy timing it was very bad you know for me financially and the people I got into an accident were fine, but I was <wa> you know they"
"You know you didn't ask for anything but to repair the damage, but it was just terrible timing."
I wish that hadn't happened.
it sucks <Laughter> it has sucks I'm about it now but anyway it does suck
"Well, I'm a pretty good sleeper I though I'm of course wired to later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job to allow me to get a fairly flexible schedule, but on the same token uh"
I wish I could <cou> were like hard wired to go to sleep earlier because I just end up staying on
Until one or two every night uh and
"It's just too late, you know, even if I'm a full eight hours or what's not sleeping it's not always at night, you know that half of my sleep is like in the kind of early daylight hours and I wish I was"
more than
able to sleep you know going to sleep like ten or eleven
and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to
go to sleep later and wake up later
"I feel pretty good, I didn't complain physically, and you know I feel good."
You know my relationships with my family and friends are good.
around everything is great so far I have absolutely no real complaints uh as far as I feel about myself or anything
"No, no, I was pretty much in line with my behavior and my thoughts that I think to"
everything was pretty okay pretty stable no nothing traumatic nothing about somehow a resurgence from the past nothing like that has happened or happens
no
no
"Well, I think there are a lot of things that everyone regrets, yes, there are many things about <sigh>"
in my life uh yeah as I said i
I regret uh you know maybe don't try harder in my younger days you know i
There's a period of time in my early twenties where I didn't work for a while I just uh
"I was hanging out with a lot of friends you know, I guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked just uh you know we"
"We got high every day or it seemed like I don't know every day that it was just... eh, but it was some kind of throwaway time in my life."
I would say that to <sigh>
It's important
"to deal with the world, I think I think I've let something out of the world, a bit I think it's also I would say that it's important to"
Recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what kind of potential you know future activities you can expect from
"The people you're dealing with, I think I'd say that..."
"somehow trying to focus on what I wanted to do with my life instead of just thinking well you know that things will work,"
"After all, they do, but I think you know that it's lost a little time with this..."
the approach is somehow fatalistic
"and I think that I would say that you know to just try to concentrate you know that you don't know that not everyone works according to the same schedule and life is not a race, but I would say that"
it was important to have a goal in mind or a kind of
You know idea for what you want from life as opposed to just waiting somehow and to think that things are falling in place
To <sigh>
Good i <sigh>
I guess when people don't give me much
"take even constructive criticism especially well for some reason I think that for < f> at least for me I've somehow figured things out, although I'm sure I'm wrong that"
So I just think in terms of how uh group work I've done professionally or academically you know when some of my work is
Sorted or tested
"I don't do well, and I take it personally when I should."
Uh it was probably about a year and a half ago I was working on a research project at work and uh someone with much less experience < exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to pass it and it was someone
Just from college you know.
went beyond what we had done and
"You know, it was just some kind of rewording things and it just seemed like cosmetic changes that were made just to change things and"
I took some personal insult that just because I thought I had a lot more experience and more education and uh
"It was unnecessary for you to know that I thought this whole thing was a waste of time, and you know that I just..."
"I didn't think she was someone who was qualified to repeat all our work, or even to uh"
"not to repeat, but to edit or to Uh <sigh> not <no> eh Proofreading I think to make any kind of"
"You know, qualitative changes I just thought it was a really bad idea, and I thought I knew you shouldn't have seen it that way, but I thought that"
"the fact that they brought in someone with almost no experience you know was an affront to us who had been working on this project, but"
You know it wasn't our call.
mm most memorable experiences around
"Well, I guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my..."
the first real trip I took from me uh i I took the uh the amtrak to new mexico and I was out there exploring things around
for about ten days alone uh so that was somehow the longest
"Period of time up to this point and I was in my I was I don't know, twenty-three maybe at the time that I"
I was really on my own from all I was in parts of the new Mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time.
and it was very memorable because I felt on it on my own I was like I was really uh you know the things I wouldn't have seen if I had travel companions around and it was a lot of fun
Uh good i was very happy recently i was getting married in a couple of months uh i got engaged on the day of work uh in two thousand twelve thanks <Laughter> so i was uh that was a very happy day of this whole process you know to meet someone and we
"We went very fast and recognized where we were, so I was a pretty man."
I think we got engaged and then we shared it with our family.
"very happy times around new years was happy you know, uh I'm in a happy period of my life at the moment so"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yes, thank you <Laughter>"
Uh <sigh> with a <sigh> type of
sense of humor that maybe not everyone gets I'd say uh also uh
You know.
helpful rest maybe relax uh <sigh>
"intelligent, you know I like to recycle, that's something they'd say."
i
what else I think about my best friend could say that
I like animals I've always had dogs and cats so they can describe me as a human person or I mean an animal person apologize to me
also know about you quite simply you know flexible with plans
mm
I'd say one of the most proud in my life...
hmm <tisk>
"well <sigh> i i i i am pretty happy with the level of education I've got, i also go back anyway beginning in autumn i start a p_h_d program so i am happy that i am happy that i know about you, break some of my bad habits from the past i would say if i'm proud of everything, it's that"
"I'm often very happy that I don't know if pride is the right word, but..."
my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh
I'd say maybe the fact that
"It's much different from my life is much different than it was about ten years ago, you know, the change I'm happy and proud that"
no problem have a good day thank you
Goodbye.
