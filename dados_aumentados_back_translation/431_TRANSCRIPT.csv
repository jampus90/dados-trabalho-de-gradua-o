the rocks the various sculptures of the rocks and the landscape was simply fascinating

"I love people, I love helping people"
uh
mm
Yes <Laughter>
"No, that's a little personal <laughter>"
what advice would I give me ten twenty years
mm always aim for the best
and best do the best you can every day
mm
"they are great kids sometimes they come out of hand sometimes disrespectful, but overall they are great"
"Yeah, it's very simple."
"Yes, for the help of"
"the help of my father, her father, my husband, he's a"
a disciplinary so it's a bit easy for me < laughter>
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
the best thing about being a parent is to see
to see uh uh
a person you have born to develop
develop into a healthy person and
take the values you have taught them and keep the values
"that you have taught them, and"
continue to excel in her life
The hardest part about being a parent is...
Seeing your child sick or seeing her in a situation where you have no control and you can't do anything about it
"it's very difficult, then you want to be able to"
You want to be able to
be in any situation or have control over any situation and some things you just don't
Like illness
"like I said, like when"
"When one of my children is sick, I feel"
"I do the best I can, but seeing her in pain and feeling like I want"
I wish I could take this pain if they went through everything I wish I could take it instead of them
I think with me I'm more victim than my
Mom was more for me to think about
my demonstration of love is a bit more than it was for me
of which I am very proud
"I'm proud to have a family, I guess, because it's something I've always wanted in life to have a family."
and I guess I'm very proud of it
mm
See you.
