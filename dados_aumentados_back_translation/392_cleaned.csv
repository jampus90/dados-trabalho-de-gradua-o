"No, not really."
"mm depends on the situation or who I am when I meet people for the first time, I can be shy uh, but if it's someone I know for a while, I can be outgoing"

I think I feel guilty about not talking to my grandparents as much as I should

"I mean, it was hard at the time uh but"
"I've made the right decision, I think"
Uh my grandmother was a positive influence of a young age
