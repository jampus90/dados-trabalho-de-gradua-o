and for some reason
"As much as I try, I don't tell them, because I don't want them to be the way I need them to know whatever."
"I keep thinking about it and I'm gonna cry about how it happened yesterday, but it happened three years, just the mere fact of almost losing him."

"and when I first came here, I had the personality and attitude of the family and love and being nice and here showed me that everyone was somehow here for themselves"
"also those like the other girls I work with, so I've learned to cut people off and be short with people if that's not really me"
But all I can see is that you have to be like this <Laughter>
