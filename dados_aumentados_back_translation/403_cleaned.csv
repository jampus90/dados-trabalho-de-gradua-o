Type of food I love the beaches

Aquarium stuff like these museums
The Smog

There are a lot of creepy guys <Laughter>
I've travelled pretty much l_a I was across the country and back three times twice when I was seventeen
I like meeting new people and trying out different foods and seeing how other people live
"When I was seventeen, I ran away with my friend to take New York to Watertown."
like a naval army type of city
we had an apartment there it has snowed a lot
We sold antiques for a living
To get passports press passports for the sunset strip music festival by a friend
and meet rock stars and hang out like the private parties
I am very extraordinary I love people
"I go to the gym and learn a little, I think it helps relieve stress and"
Keeps my energy level going I realized <rea> noticed when I wasn't a few days I feel a little tired than normal and
It just helps me feel good
I'm pretty good at I'm very quiet around I worked a lot of events and
"Jobs where you have to talk to thousands of people a day and people, and you have to stay calm and"
"You know they're the customers, so you need to make them feel wanted and"
Good and realize that you are being paid because the money they spend is so
I'm good at solving <reso> like consumer conflicts and things on the job
I had a drunk friend who just
falling around screaming and saying rude things to people and I somehowa
"She started to get loud, like she was just telling her to stop, and that she was intimidating, and what she said to people was very mean that you knew."
And I wonder if you're talking to people like that.
they may not like it and they might attack you or something you know you never know it's l_a.
I really don't feel guilty about any decisions I made in my life.
"think I've made really good decisions and I always stick to my moral compass, what I do, I grew up in church so"
"I haven't left in years, but I still have these values and"
You know the rules of the ten commandments and things in my head
I had a slum lord landlord and...
I wish I'd called you to know the right authorities and
He's been through a court trial instead of chasing him out like me because it wasn't after the code.

"A few years ago, I was with a guy, and he wanted me to move back where he came from."
and after a few months you know that he came to l_a and went home
decided to move there and I had just started
You know that this business I did was going to pick up event planning and I decided to leave there
"and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work, but"
it was hard to decide how I should leave l_a and do this
jump and follow something new and experience something new or stay in what I did
I was I had a degree in dental assistance I did that for like a year I didn't like it and then I studied communication
such as radio and television broadcasting and journalism
I do event work and wrote for a magazine for a few years and I try to like it.
get a site going and then have how where I write my own and what's going on instead
you know you write for someone else
I always wanted to write and was always growing up in the news and music and art I really like connie chung
she was like a channel four newscasters in the eighties and I love barbara walters
"I was a nerd, not a laugh."
My sister doesn't talk to the family.
"and I have a good relationship with my mother, I never knew my father didn't mind me."
"I have cousins and stuff, but everyone is scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them on the phone we only communicate on Facebook or like Twitter"
"Oh, I'm going to sleep right"
"When I get tired, I just go to sleep"
pretty well energetic I have motivated to go for more event work you know event planning things and look for
really grinding in more than I was
"I mean, it's kind of hard because you have to talk to people and get them to trust you and"
see that you plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event as someone else
no
no
"I mean, I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens to someone getting cancer or someone I know dies"
I wouldn't say that I just
"super like oh my God happy all the time, but it's like a straight"
Kiel that I feel pretty good all the time
I am very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them quietly and
I could adapt to different situations and even if I'm not my scene
or situation or group of people I'm used to that I could still jump into
Talk to people and feel comfortable and find friends and adapt
I want to make more money <Laughter>
I remember as in the second grade that these people made fun of me because I was very tall and thin and I was like
just a's one of the highest grades in the class so
People would make fun of me and call me giraffe or
Such things
very talkative she would just say that I'm talking to everyone
and that I'm very friendly and if you need help
I'm helping someone you know
oh recently I went to the ocean and visited a friend I've known for years and
we just went to the burger and hung on the beach and
We got her two-year-old son and took him to the park and played and
"It was really nice and it was cool to visit her, I hadn't seen her in six months and"
it was really funny and I want to go back and
I like the area

"Maybe I could try to find my own work more like for my business, instead of working for other people"
"I think I'm following it, but I think maybe I could put a little more time in it a day"
I don't really know anything like
that I want to delete or don't happen
"No, I feel good about my decisions I've made and I think I'm on the right track and"
"a lot of things I wanted to do, then balls roll and I'll always <g> you know I'll do things I'm not as big as I want to be, but I feel like I'm on my way there"
"As I did ten years ago, I would have told myself to work more a day instead of as much as I was."
"My friend, whom we call Mojo"
um mojo has a magazine and I have just written years and
he really urges me to like to continue writing and continue to hold events and keep on the ball I roll and
He's one of the biggest people you know in my life and tells me you're talented.
you could do it you know he's just a real
good as motivation for me
You know I was on t_v shows and started my own event thing.
"I have a lot of people who read what I write every day and follow on I just think it's a you know it's not exactly where I want to be, but it's a great start"
and I worked to get to this point
Thank you.
