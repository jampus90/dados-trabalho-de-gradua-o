"Well, when I moved here, I was twenty-five, so it was much more fun, because when you're young in town, you can have a lot of fun"
"and then I came into the real estate and did really good for a while and then the market crashed and so now I'm old and I'm not making money, so times are hard"

"It's good, I mean, I don't like my neighbors, I hate my neighbors, but the ones upstairs just moved out, so that's good news hopefully the ones who move in aren't so loud and the lower ones I just can't stand because they're arguing with me"
What are you doing?
"Why, because they say because of my hardwood floors that"
I've been there for ten years and they're still arguing about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors
"Yeah, that's good."
What was the question?
my mother was a very positive influence that she always tracked me down.
She lived with me for the last ten years until she moved to Rhode Island recently to live with my brother.
"very close to my mother, not so close to my brother, but we're not so close to me."
um
"So I mean, we love each other, we just don't get along all the time."

About four years ago
To be good I had <ha> I was beaten and I had uh identity theft
"And, uh, you know, I was just scared to leave, so I had to get over spending a year like this in my house without leaving"
Um and just depressed all the time I said I had to get out and start talking to people and so I got
Thank you.
"Okay, I'm panicking about the job situation"
"You know, because my bills are pretty high and I don't have a stable income right now."
So that's what worries me the most is my uh financial situation
"Yeah, that's good."
um 
"Yes, I mean"
"Well basically it's like I just stopped drinking together recently, so I don't drink anymore, so I realize"
"Yeah, I mean, it's good because number one I don't have the money and number two I don't like how I handle when I drink"
"So that's a positive thing, but now that I drank, it helped me just forget and numb me."
"Now I have to feel through the feelings that are pretty good because I can talk my way through them, so I guess I'm developing"
"Yeah, a long time ago, you know, I took a lot of medication here and there, and..."
they really would numb some of them me some of them would
"I feel hyper that's how I recently decided to take < t> three to six months in the last six months just to take nothing, so I don't take anything I barely take an aspirin"
just to get my body into a normal state
"Uh, not really."
"always worry about just a lot of worries getting worried about everything, oh what happens when I'm in a car accident, what happens when I can't pay my mortgage, what happens when I"
eh eh anyway just so many things I worry about and that was what depresses me
I know.
at a certain point I had
a few good therapists and I had some bad therapists
I like the ones who talk to me.
and give me some guidance in contrast to those who just listen
"and then they just say, okay, your time is so high and just prescribe me medications, so I think I'd be better off with a psychiatrist < psychiatrist> psychologist than a psychiatrist"
um
"Well, I'm not going to therapy right now, but..."
the therapy I had before
"It was more like people trying to just come in, check me in and give me medication."
"I had another therapy where I was back and forth, like okay. Well, that's what I'm thinking about, and you're thinking about it, and this kind of therapy is better."
"Um, I'm just..."
I didn't get the right therapists recently.
So I knew the root of my problem was drinking because it's a depression.
You know that stopping drinking definitely has me a much clearer mind and just working through things you know yourself
um 
I can't think of anything right now.
um 
It's been a long time since I can't really think of a time when I felt really happy.
Thank you very much <sniffle>
um 
"Okay, when I was a kid"
um 
I had a little dog and that big dog came and attacked him and killed him.
so then a little later my father
"came and he said to my brother and me, we were kids going to the car, there are two packages in the car, so get them."
"So I was like yeah yeah yeah because I never listened to my parents, so I was like a spoiled brat, but finally he said go to the car, what is that?"
"Oh okay, he said go to the car and get that out of the car so I finally left and when I opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food, so that's one of my memorable experiences"
"Yeah, because I'm an animal lover."
um
"the way I treated the people before, when"
I was hurt I was really mean or rude to the people
"when I felt like you knew I was hurting I had to hurt everyone around me so, um, but when I've been drinking since I heard that I didn't do it so"
"So I think the problem is drinking and now that I let that go because I did it for the wrong reasons, you know that I did it to not believe I didn't do it to be sociable"
get in a career that is really stable
like uh eh you know like a doctor or a nurse or a lawyer
"something you know, or in advertising I would have in that a selling position it could be very good and very good or very bad so"
"You must always be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales, but if you make your money, save your money don't go spending it on extravagant things"
When I have a job when I'm able to work
when I help other people
"when other people around me are happy and laugh, when I can make people laugh, that makes me in a good mood"
"Okay, thanks."
"You're welcome, thank you."
See you.
