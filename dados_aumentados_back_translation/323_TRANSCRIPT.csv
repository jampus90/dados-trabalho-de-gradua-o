"this is a black college and they always want me to go to a black college, but of course I didn't want to do that < laughter> uh I went to illinois so"
"They are a very positive example for me, there are certain things I don't do today because I don't drink, I don't curse, I don't look at people who do, but I don't have that much respect for people who do a lot of either one of these things."
I love to drive I love to travel
"and my dad always took us somewhere he was gone every weekend, we would go somewhere because we were in Chicago indiana michigan somewhere in the area where we went to Michigan and picked fruit or we all got our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana something like that"

we drove the Orient Express
"We did not go all the way to Istanbul, we went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris."
"this was probably the best experience I ever had in my life I never really cared for Europe because it explained so much here in unity and so much in America and I was on alaska and hawaii, but we said we would do something else and"
We always wanted to go to the Orient Express and we have this expensive but phenomenal journey
must do it once it is a once journey not even in life only once
do not travel faster than we have done much when the children were younger
But...
"There are a lot of things we should have done, we shouldn't have done, I wish I'd gone to Chicago <chica> we'd always go to Chicago on Thanksgiving, but I think we should have gone more than just Thanksgiving"
"My parents are coming here for Christmas, but I think we could have..."
much more done when it comes to
"Yes, that's why it's a regret because it could have been avoided, there are things we could have done, and we spent our time working and more worried about moving forward than really family and what's closest to us"
