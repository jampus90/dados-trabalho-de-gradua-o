"Yes, thank you."
"Thank you, how are you?"
I grew up in Oklahoma
mhm
"I moved to I_a five and a half years ago, so I used to be in the west on the east coast and then I decided to come here."
"my home town not very often around most of my family moved away so I visit them, but I didn't really go back to oklahoma much"
< sniffle>
Oklahoma is quite different around
Uh l_a is much more exciting
There is much more to
To do here and to
Uh the sea is obviously very nice so
um
You know that's a good question.
I wanted to try something new and I always loved the beach and
"I thought uh and I also like big cities, so I thought l_a could come a good place for me"
very it's probably one of the best uh decisions I've ever made
< slaughter>
Pretty easy I think around anyway it seems kind of natural
it seemed like a good fit
I just really like it here.
"Oh, it's great, I've got some roommates and we're really getting out of here I live a few blocks from the beach"
Every day I can walk on the beach or
"You know, hanging out with friends, and it's just like being on vacation all the time, it's really nice."
mm
I studied philosophy and political theory and government
and made a little English literature on the page
um it
I think it just happened.
I went to liberal art school and got a kind of exposure to a lot of different
areas and
I simply followed what I liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that
um
"not exactly I work for an educational nonprofit, so I work with graduates <grad> with graduates around in the social sciences and humanities"
But I don't really use my philosophy background very often.
<Laughter>um
You know that I actually studied to become a success coach
"So, I work with students is a kind of nicer"
"Aspect of doing, but I would really like to work with others <o> with other people so not only students"
but to help them achieve their goals and realize their dreams
I'd say it's pretty hard in the sense that
um
"You know, it can be a challenge for people, actually"
are motivated and do all the work that is required to
"made to realize their dreams, but and it is also a challenge because there is a life in it"
uh requires the collection of money so to find people who are willing to pay for it can also be difficult
I'm definitely on the shy side I'm an introvert so
"I'm pretty good at a situation with people, but if you get me in a group with more than a few people"
"I'm very much an observer, so I tend to listen a lot and I'm not so engaged"
And I think this is
something that goes it is noticed by others and it is perhaps a little strange for them especially if they are not introverted
"So I would say, and it's also a challenge for me, I tend not to be the person who imagines himself in a room full of strangers."
"<Laughter> pretty good, I think"
But I have a temperament so I can get upset from time to time.
not really around it can be a challenge when I drive < laughter> but other than that no
hmm
hmm
I'm not sure.
It would probably have been a discussion about politics.
and it would probably have been a friendly argument
um
Probably with one of my liberal friends so
but I can't remember the appointed time
< slaughter>
< sniffle>
mm
I'm meditating
For the
do it almost every day
I also go to the beach I love the sea and I like the sounds and just out there is very peaceful
and I like to read and am alone with my thoughts
That's nice.
mm
Let me think about it for a second.
<Sigh>
hmm
"<Laughter> I have a hard time coming with everything I mean, I'm sure there are many things around"
simply nothing comes to mind <sniffle>
<Sigh>
hmm
"Okay, I'm sorry <Laughter>"
hmm
"Well, that's not exactly an event, it's a dream and it's not special"
"go to traumatic dream as far as dreams, but"
I have it sometimes.
probably more often than I want so that I wouldn't be upset if it
Do you know if I didn't have it?
"Um, and it's just a version of a dream I think a lot of people probably have, but..."
I'm usually in school somewhere.
at the end of the semester
"I didn't go to class to do the exams, I'll fail."
and
You know really unhappy about why not I
learn and attend class as I should
"Um, that was actually no problem for me at school, but now I have this dream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating"
and I'm not quite sure
"Why I mean, I know why, but I don't know what it's about, because it's not like I'm consciously worried, at least about the failure things so"
"No, I don't think so."
At least not that I'm aware of it.
< sniffle>
"I feel guilty, I have a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew."
and they live on the east coast
And I love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and around
I lived there when he was younger.
to spend a lot of time with them and
"Since I was in California, and especially last year, I've spent a lot less time trying to"
"for example, I saw her for a week at Christmas and then I went back"
"in <i> at the beginning of May, so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time I had seen her"
and that I felt bad because
we enjoy each other's company and he
"You know, I really like being there, but then he gets angry when I go and he asks when I'm coming back."
So this is...
That makes me bad sometimes
mm
um
"Well, I have a brother, I'm very close to him"
He's younger.
and
He's four and a half years younger.
"He's married, I have a nephew."
My two parents died.
"So it's just the two of us and we have a large, extended family, but we're not that close to most of them."
um
on my father's side is a brother
"Um, and he's married and has a couple of kids, so I have some cousins on this side, but then on my mother's side there's"
<sigh> five <fi> four or five other children
"most of them with several children of their own so I have a lot of cousins on this site, but they live throughout the country and around"
So we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook around and there a few I talk to on the phone and visit from time to time
But you know we're not so close to our extended family
um
I would say well
"I mean, I have a lot of friends that I think were positive influences"
Scrubbed_entry
When I came to California
um
"I started at a non-profit work and it was kind of a strange place, it was very different from what I was used to"
it was a bit challenging and she also worked there so
We worked on a joint program over the summer and got to know each other and
We have just built up this really strong friendship and
"She's kind of, I'd say, my best friend probably here and probably only in general, and now she's moved to Vegas, which is a bit tough for me."
"But we're going to Napa this weekend, so it should be good, but she was a very good woman, because when I came here and didn't really know anyone, she was very positive."
"And you know, since I'm an introverter, it's not that easy for me to make friends, it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know"
"I think she's kind of bringing me, so it's a lot of fun hanging out with her and that was nice"
I'm a sleeper <Laughter> so it's pretty easy around
Sometimes I know you know.
"Depending on how long I'm awake < clears throat> I can get hurt < wou> a little upset and so sometimes I need to take a while to decompress, but"
I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that's very helpful
"Um, and I can sleep"
uh
"You know, I sleep generally in 90-minute cycles."
so
"You know, usually six or seven and a half hours, but I can easily sleep nine hours if I have the time and inclination"
I don't usually wake up in the middle of the night.
or at least if I don't remember
so
"Well, I don't actually sleep very well when I travel, is one of the things I do for work, that I travel, a little bit"
"because I work for a company that's in the east, so I work from home"
most of the time but then I travel
like a week in a month
"And when I travel, I take the red eye"
"Um, and then I'm going to visit with many friends in the evening so I don't sleep that much it's not that I"
Sleep
bad or bad it's just that I don't have so much time to sleep
and on the first day
after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay
but usually the second day is not very good
So I get much tireder uh and it's harder to concentrate
and
I don't know it feels like a fight.
I'd say good.
um
"Summer is a little <l> is a busy time for the organization I work for, so I'm a little"
"I don't know if stress is the right word, but I know I'm a little worried."
"Everything is going well this summer, but in general I feel pretty good"
I can't think of anything.
There's one thing I'm fighting for with exercise as I like walking around a lot
and I wander with friends and
"To I was really motivated to go for a few months, but then I went away to the east coast and when I came back, I was much less motivated"
Because I didn't really train when I was there.
"and I had been out of habit, although it was only about ten days and so now I'm struggling to try to get back into the routine and it's not as good as I want"
It's okay.
Thank you.
no
no
All right.

He's having a lot of fun and
he really likes me and I really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and
"We're going to make a book club now, so we're going to skype and"
Maybe I get more time with him so but uh just being around him is fun
hmm
<Sigh>
She'd probably say I know how to have fun.
But that I can be serious
and
that I know you care about others
uh
and that I'm loyal
and
I'm not sure what else
um
I think those are probably the most important things.
< sniffle>
"I wish I had more self-discipline, so"
um
I wish you knew I could diet or eat healthier foods and not have a problem
Uh with sugar because I love to eat sugar
"I wish I wouldn't postpone because I got much better about it, but I still do, and that can be a challenge"
"Um, and I wish I..."
xxx
I don't know.
uh
I think I wish I was in a relationship
so
Probably those things
mm
hmm
So at the last organization I worked with
I had a boss and she was
I don't feel like she's...
I don't think we were very compatible.
I pressed my buttons or so I thought
and so on
One day she was really upset about something because a board member called her and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer.
"Um, and he was upset about something and"
"It was something to do with my department, so she called me to her office and let me know how unhappy she was"
um
but it wasn't me being a manager for many years around and I
have very strong opinions about how you treat
Challenges with people <peo> with employees
"and the way she treated the situation with me was really inappropriate, I thought."
She wanted to scare me and make me feel.
"You know, incompetent or at least that's the way I thought about it."
and
I knew it.
I tried to be very calm and
"said I'd take care of it, and I took care of it."
after that our relationship was not the same anymore and I stayed left there in the end <st> uh
"To go back to the old organization for which I hadn't worked so long after, because I just didn't really have much respect for her after she did this to me."
or after we had this interaction so
< slaughter>
So I heard this advice the other day and or so
thing and that I thought was really profound and I wish I had
Read it then
This is
When you think about buying something instead of thinking
uh oh
Here's this beautiful coat that costs 100 bucks I'm going to buy.
it uh don't think it's as cost a hundred dollars think it's as cost ten times that
"Because that's effective what your money could do if you don't spend it on this coat, but it invests it"
you know
"intelligent, you'd have ten times as much money."
You really should think about it in these terms and I think I was much more a consumer than a saver and so I wish that I could uh
"Ten or twenty years ago, I was more aware of this"
<sigh> probably

They asked me to be his sponsor and his guardian if anything happened to them.
And that meant a lot to me because it made me feel that they trusted me and thought I was a good person who could take care of their child if something happened to them.
so
<sigh> let's see
good uh in <i> it wasn't really recent but in February I liked to travel and a friend uh and I went to singapore
Uh and I have to fly first class
We used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get those around
Tickets and so uh that was really pleasant because
"to pull the seats down you get to sleep the food is delicious, you get special attention and I was also not in singapure before, so that was kind of cool too"
safe
Thank you.
See you.
