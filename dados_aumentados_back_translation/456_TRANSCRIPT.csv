Yes
Thank you.
Uh boston massachusetts
Yes
I moved to l_a about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one
often at least a few times a year
"around God I love both cities they are polar towards in many ways, but there are things about both of them that I love"
Uh to act and write
"mm it's still not completely reality for me, but it was actually very easy because of the"
the creative factor out here allowed me to track what I wanted creatively and
it was different the social culture was different in a way where I had grown up and it fit me better my personality
"Oh, God, I like the fact that you can come here and track every niche of you, creativity or art or entertainment you want and somehow make your own way"
Uh I grew up where it snows all the time and is very cold so
"sounds obvious, but clearly, I like that it's that you swim all year round and"
"I like that there's always something to do, no matter what day of the week it is."
"what I don't like uh good I miss my family <fam> I miss that it's not <no> I don't like that it's not a big family element I miss I'm a big family girl I miss my family I feel like it's very crowded here, but nevertheless it's very easy anyway somehow isolated here"
mhm
"I can't see your shoes, but I don't usually travel too much to Boston and"
"Hmm anyway florida where my parents live, but I enjoy traveling and many trips in California and here"
"Oh, just to have an adventure, to have some fun, or when I go home, that means I'll see my family"
♪ Empty the throat ♪
to one of my travels mm God good
I like to go to Northern California to San Francisco I have family and friends there
Always super super fun uh in God at college I'm with my college friend
"When I was in Boston, we went to San Francisco and drove to L_a and Las Vegas, so I realized that I wanted to move here, so that was a big one."
in general
only
I guess it would move around here that I moved to when I got on a plane but didn't know anyone here.
I just talked to a girl I met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport.
We never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the flight was out here
it was big monumental
I felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever
mhm
studied communication to get a lot of lots of different uh writing styles I eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and an English minor
Writing to follow up the letter
"Writer uh good I guess you could say writer slash actress who's around, but I guess writing is first"
Hard
"very hard because you need to push no one you will to do it, you have to be self-starter, you have to do it, so it's very hard because I don't own that naturally in my personality I do, but not as much as I need to"
I would say starting from in general
i <sigh> sometimes take a walk when I feel tense to hear ambient music helps when I need a soothing background white noise
soothing calming area and only
just your basic deep breaths and just take a minute to
"to return to a quiet, neutral place"
I'm
always better no <Laughter> around I'm okay <ok> I'm
Good at controlling my temperament
Because I don't usually
"have a temper too often, but if I and I lose my cool, I have a hard time controlling it"
Yes
no
<Laughter> mm
Fighting with someone for
My God!
I guess it was a friend.
a friend a girlfriend it
It wasn't about that.
Our
our individual perspectives on a
"a certain situation between us, which"
were obviously very different around and it started as something big and then we realized that this
"That's stupid, we don't have to argue about it, so it ended quickly."

I guess it would have been with an ex-boyfriend struggling with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff that definitely lost my temper and escalated a situation in a way that
"It shouldn't have been necessary, I wish I'd just left."
mm
"I don't know if I could have avoided the whole situation, but I definitely would have"
made the result much less
Chaotic
hmm
I guess that would be
"Hmm going away from someone who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh, but that I really wanted in my life and it was a true struggle with morality and"
I have to say that I have to do something that's really hard for me to do.
Type of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and
"I had to make some kind of adult-decision relationship-wise, but it was still transferred to other areas of my life and taught me that"
you know you won't always
feel great <gr> every decision will not always be easy and feel good
Yes
"I was somehow forced into this problem, just what was going on in life was a way that you can't just ignore these signs."
"Yeah, that's good."
I guess it would be a special argument that I had with someone who was random.
in some kind of public place and I got in trouble for it I wish I could delete that
my relationship with my family <fam> I have a wonderful family I am completely blessed amazing parents I have a brother and he has a little girl so I have a baby niece that I love more than anything in the world and
"I couldn't ask for a better family, they're"
the ideal
I'm sure my parents are just wonderful people who are taught only by example and
I feel like a good mix of both
"It's pretty easy, I've been trying lately, it's been a little hard my sleep was out, but for the most part I have"
come to realize the meaning of it and it has been quite simple
A bit edgy or fidgety maybe a little out of it I could seem like I'm
in a good mood because I might be a little dizzy and
"uh laugh more just type of <laughter> high emotions, but overall get irritated around faster and"
just to feel sweating more easy
Just feel a little away
I've been feeling pretty good lately
mm not really only
try to be more concentrated < clears throat>
do things
I'm just trying to focus on what I want to do for a living.
"Stop wasting time, or you'll know."
simply procrastinating and and get things done and inspired go and see
You know you're with people who do what I want and just carry it into my own life.
no
no
oh oh just a few days I was just with my family and my baby niece in Florida and
"That's why I went down there to see her, so it was just great that I'm always happy when I see her."
likely to be considered as very
funny
Humor would definitely be one of the first things they would say joke a little
"Smartass in my personality, but they would describe me as always, uh, unconditionally there for them and just"
They know they know I'm there when they always need them.
my drive is more driven and only always do things
I guess it would be a new
a new ex-boyfriend who was a mistake of a relationship uh
"Yeah, kind of just"
I think because he thought the way he thought about himself certain things he would say and
even if what he said did not directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that I even felt with this person
Like I'm letting people into my life who shouldn't be there.
"I'm wrong, and that was terrible."
yes I don't regret listening to my gut feelings
Don't test yourself.
<sigh> <free throat> around big listeners
constant sense of humor
uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all
only people from all age groups racial sex
"Whatever I just yearn for variety and love, just you know that I'm just me people person"
And I...
I start every day with an empty slate
I did some acting work on a series with a really big group of people and it was a very cool creative experience very inspiring
I probably come to I_a alone without knowing anyone and staying here and tracking what I want to do.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
