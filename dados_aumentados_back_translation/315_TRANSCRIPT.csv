"Well, I'm a football recruit, so I'm traveling."
uh around the world to sign various football players for our sports management companies

I remember traveling to uh
Scrubbed_entry
and bring him to clubs and that and that and we're not that kind of organization
<Laughter> yeah
around dishonesty i <sigh> I don't like it when people are dishonest to really really really bother me and don't honestly not real around
that this upsets me very much
um
"I tend to, just"
try to free me from the situation to clean my mind normally walk or something or just walk in a room alone and just try to clean my head < he> my head
"I agree sometimes, but I can definitely be better."
"Oh, uh,"
I argued a few days ago with my lady and it was about to
our daughter and some of the things she does at school and she wants to educate her in a way and I think
I want to raise her style from another way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so I think discipline is a great key and the key is life and she was raised a little differently
um
I don't just know
angry excited you know if you're in an argument that's what you feel so
They do and say things that
the
That bothers you and you just keep going.
um
"Yeah, a little."
I don't just know.
"I don't know how I feel, but I can't say how I feel."
A little bit
a little
um
"I don't know, just..."
Reality
um
Honesty
The truth is just right outside the door
I'm pretty close.
I'm pretty close to my family.
"Oh, not only her subject"
They've been raised differently.
"I think society becomes even wilder with the way children are raised and no discipline and the things they do, what we do"
they live and everything is inflated so much where
um
it's up to a point where it gets out of hand I think kids these days are to some extent much wilder than I was and
and generations before me and just able to do and say and lack of respect and you just know
Education-wise it's just I think it's just hard times for kids and the way they act uh it's
It's ridiculous to me.
um
I definitely like to see sport uh i like to play i like to travel i like to skate
um
I like
"Just like a guy who likes to see different sights and visit different places, how different <difft> I'm a big movie person, so I like to go into such theater stuff."
um
I really live it.
I always wanted to be in a kind of sports industry and that's what I'm doing now I just uh my goal was to get a little higher in the ladder and own my own sports management company around but I'm pretty good for me so
I'm happy
"Yeah, that's good."
no
no
no
"It's okay, I'd say it's pretty easy"
Irritated
tired
<Sigh>
I don't know it's been a while.
A few weeks ago
What did you say?
"No, not really."
I think he would describe me as a standing up guy I'm trying to be a good loyal friend and
and an adult I think he'd describe me like this
Uh school went to school grew up together I know all my friends for pretty much my whole life
"Yeah, that's good."
Uh very close to me our uh my friends and I'm very close uh around us doing pretty much together still at this age
"I'm honest, I'm loyal, very loyal."
"I'm a hard worker, I think I'm around"
to some degree I'm just not the average guy I'm pretty much I'm another breed I'm just wearing and acting a little different than a normal guy
I don't know how I grew up and how my dad was somehow different uh and he didn't go with those in the crowd and I think I learned a lot from him and it's just it's about
Type of
the same way I took
"Um, many things I regret"
I regret
many choices in my life
"Uh, yeah, one..."
I'm actually...
let a lady go in my life years ago that I thought was my soul mate and
We had a big fight and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that this break I started with someone else and I told her I'm going my way and she's going her way I think that this is a big deal.
a bad decision a very bad decision
Yeah totally I think I'd have a step back and really just about the situation a little more instead of uh
Be so excited and move forward
I tend to get upset and then my thoughts get so clouded
uh mm i
I need to think a little more when I'm excited
"I don't know, just"
Experience and time
"When you know how to make up for your mistakes, and and..."
be better over
different decisions after you have made the mistakes
To <sigh>
think a little harder about situations <situatio> uh about situations and things and the decisions <dec> decisions that you uh
think much longer and harder before you make it and I think the result would be a little different today
um
My grandmother was always one around a positive influence uh she's a big black woman uh with an old school
I think I added that she's a great woman in my life.

Scrubbed_entry

To <sigh>
Benefits able if I or if I am
have an objective; or
or something I'm supposed to do this week or this day and I'm doing it always puts me in a good mood or getting my work done and I'm doing the way I'm supposed to do it in a timely manner that always puts me in a good mood
um
"to be a positive role model for younger children who are in our sports academy program, I think, when I got older"
The process of thinking and the way I look at life has totally changed and
I think I can find a lot of kids I can handle now and say that you know that this is someone who
this is a positive <po> a positive influence in my life
