<snort> born and raised born and raised
It is at home < snort> eating people culture
Transport
There are many of us <sigh>
Too many of us probably
oh
I haven't traveled in the past lately
Uh the destination I enjoy traveling no longer at all I did when I was young but no longer < snort> it's the destination
All right.
< snort> uh in ninety two I went to spain
and my grandmother my father's mother was born in Spain I went back to pursue her roots < snort>
and I spent a week in Madrid a week in Barcelona and a week in Majorca
<sniff> had a great time
I liked it.
ooh
"It was an everyday thing, people were friendly uh"
find that some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting
<snort> uh I studied uh polysci and uh sociology
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
well at the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"Well, I had my dream job for a while I did sports research for uh native American tribes"
"- Yes, but yes."
I liked it.
But that's not so...
as often as it was <freezes the neck>
mainly because of the uh
the sports offices that exist now that didn't exist when I started
I'm still enjoying it
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
I'll be what I'll be what suits me in a particular situation
Uh listen to music
I like oldies
Jazz
mm soft music
"I've learned to do it well, I haven't always been like this, but I've learned to do it well"
"If you argue, I suppose you mean words uh"
with my youngest daughter it was about one and a half years ago
"Well, it was because of an incident that I didn't like what the"
the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me and when I told her that she
"extremely defensive and instead of dealing with it, she became angry at me <snort>"
I was crazy.
uh three girls
thirty-three thirty-eight thirty-seven thirty-one
Uh three granddaughters
"11, 14, 18, so I haven't won a fight in a long time."
but I worship all six of them
uh
"Well, now I don't really think of myself as a parent < snort> since mine have grown my baby is one thirty and you never lose that but I mean I'm not upbringing at this point in my life"
I enjoy my grandchildren
"when I was a parent, yes, it's a difficult challenge"
is uh
to come to their level and understand what they understand and don't understand
And do not put your things in front of them
the hugs
"Well, my dad was physical in those days when you know no one called children's services when you got hit."
uh
"My mother was very loving, but my father, you know he would raise his hand to you if he thought it would disappoint you."
Revenge my mother <sigh> my father uh was a tough guy
But I loved him
uh
"I never felt abused by him, but I mean"
"I remember saying that if you're able to kick my ass, you can leave this house."
"that's mine, that's kind of the basis of our relationship"
my mother
my children my big children
"Well, I'm one of three sons of mine."
So I really didn't have any experience with women except uh with my mother in terms of knowing you're related
And my grandma
"and when my first daughter was born, it was like wow < snort> that it was that I fell madly in love with"
has changed my life
"Yeah, that's how it happened."
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
when my mother got sick I wasn't there for her as I should have been
and I don't feel well <goo>
"Oh yeah, you can always fix what you did at the end <snort>"
I was just in a really bad situation
But that doesn't excuse the fact that I wasn't there as I did.
at least not in my head
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
uh my second marriage probably she uh
she wanted to have uh kids and I already had my kids with my first wife
and uh
I had told her at first that I didn't want to have children and you know I had three
"Uh that and I was good with it and she hinted that she didn't want any children, so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant"
and changed our relationship and
I wouldn't basically give in and we were finally divorced
I don't know that I would have had children.
"would have had children with her, but I"
I wasn't very flexible.
what should be flexible
I don't know.
Sometimes I'm sometimes I'm not
uh
That stopped me.
Pulling my father out of life support
I kept going back to something he said to me when I was younger.
"that he would come back and haunt me, and"
When I know if I leave him there and suffer
"It took me a while to convince my two other brothers, but that's what we did."
something I could erase from my memory
To be locked up for a while.
I want to delete this from my memory <snort>
It's just
It's a daily hell
where there is very little humanity
and uh
You even do some things you're not proud of
"I've never slept, I've never slept much, and I'm one of those people when I wake up, I'm having a hard time falling asleep again."
So it's difficult <diffi> it's uh
I'm pretty much the same
I'm not changing.
So I had a friend <f> uh
"Things are good with the children and grandchildren except for the small incident with my granddaughter <granddaugh> uh my youngest daughter, but I recently had a friend who uh"
run over on a crosswalk and he's on
"He's on life support, so I didn't feel so good."
It influenced me.
"It wasn't like he was yaywalking or anything he literally ran on the crosswalk, and the guy never took the break."
and he's at this point on life support
mm not really just consistent thing about me I'm very inconsistent
uh no
no
but I had moments where I felt I was I was depressed
"Okay, I talked when you were talking, so I didn't hear the question."
Yesterday.
had a conversation with my fourteen-year-old granddaughter
I'm happy to have moments of happiness every day because I'm either talking to you or
SMS with my daughters and granddaughters every day
whether or not they are:
We're mad at each other.
"Oh, I have a lot of regret"
uh
I should have studied law.
"that's kind of something I thought, yes, started thinking about more in my life"
I was accepted I just didn't have other things I thought I wanted <snort>
uh <sigh> uh I played with uh wants to be uh uh uh a football kicker in a football team
had some tryouts things like that
but they have not whistled out
"And since that didn't work out, I kind of lost my desire to become a lawyer."
So I just did other things
I don't think it would make so much difference that I probably wouldn't listen to myself <snort>
around about me uh <hums>
uh
I could be uh
"If I don't like you, I could be very difficult."
if I don't like you
I'd like to change that.
it has in the past yeah <snort>
"Well, I have this theory that you could only make me bad at me if I gave you"
"and I'm not really big on letting people do that to me, uh although my first wife, if"
"When she left me with the kids, you knew it was my fault."
"And I wasn't sure I believed that, but I knew I was an ass"
and uh
"but I probably believed it and not in its entirety, but in parts <snort>"
<sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judging uh uh i'd listen to anyone
uh
whether I agree with you or disagree with you
uh
I taught myself.
"Control anger that I've got, that I've got, uh"
"And if I called you my friend, or if I told you I loved you, then I'm serious that I'm not doing something I'm doing."
Incidental
<snort> uh oh okay well I played eighteen holes golf with a
with an old dear friend and we were caught and
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
we spent four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner
met his new wife uh had a good time
many memories came back
mm
"I like my children, my grandchildren."
"I don't know if all children are like that, I think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology, but"
But I'm mostly because I don't.
"But if my grandchildren are any samples of it, I think they're good, I think they're pretty good."
Raising my girls
basically alone with the help of my mother
I think this is the proudest
or
"Okay, nice chatting with you"
See you.
