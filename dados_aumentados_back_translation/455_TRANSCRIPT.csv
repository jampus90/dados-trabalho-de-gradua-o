<sync>
Yes
Very good
"- Oh, you're kidding."
mhm
Uh finished school and came out to start my life
Uh not often now
not really often
because my parents both died and so that's my reason for that was my reason to go home
Before
There really is no comparison.
They know it's warm and
sunny
"and this has four seasons, so it's a completely different environment"
It took me a minute.
to adapt to the different culture
"But after I've been adjusted, you know the sunshine keeps you here"
I love the weather
I love the fact that I have the sea and the mountains
and all the things I can choose from and the diversity I find here
uh i
tend not to have things I don't like
"Uh, where I am, I know I'll find myself there"
"So and I like myself, so that means there's really nothing I don't like"
"Yes, I do."
uh i love to explore different cultures able to meet different people have a different set of experiences
and at the same time be able to share the common ground between
all kinds of people
It is a very rich experience
um
which
to the
uh i
I am thinking of Egypt and the wonderful experiences I have there.
I'm leaving.
the people and the
warm and loving experience I have the knowledge that I get to follow
by exploring the temples and pyramids etcetera things like that
There are so many there really are
But I can imagine seeing a baby in a mosque.
that was just really pure and it
"really stayed with me, how similar"
we are actually all
This is probably one of the things I remember most about one of my very first trips.
"Uh, there he is."
and
Let's see.
only the interaction of people the food you know incredible I love the food too
"Wow, I've studied a lot of different things I've studied, right, that I've studied."
Entertainment I have studied the communication I have studied
Whatever I want a pretty renaissance woman
< slaughter>
< slaughter>
It was always my way of exploring all the things I enjoy
Keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive
"and to allow me simply to be able,"
as a human being able to do this fully developed
mhm
um
I don't have a dream job
per se
What I have is a...
desire to simply be able to do freely what it is that I choose
on a daily basis
Uh probably more outgoing
mhm
< slaughter>
"Well, I start my day very relaxed because I start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that I perform"
before I move around uh I get movement
so that I keep everything in motion
and then on from there
Uh excellent <Laughter> I don't really have a
argued
um
can't remember the last time I actually had an argument
um
I don't know what this is about.
I imagine that the last time I argued about something might probably be related to money.
Situation I wish I had handled differently
"You know, I'm trying to take every experience, how they come and try not to regret"
Feelings of guilt about the way everything
uh went because they're all very positive learning experiences for me
"Uh, that I'm exploring who I'm through, so I don't really see them as"
"that they must be different, I have to learn from them"
or just accept what is
mhm
The hardest decision I've ever had to make
um
have not really a quote on quote difficult
Decision you know because I grew up in a way
where my mother was extreme
wonderful in the way she always taught me to know that it was my own life
"and so she would never make decisions for me, she always taught me to say she would always say"
It's your life.
And so
To make decisions for me not really come
as difficult to make
they're pretty easy to do because I've been doing them since childhood
So I don't really have a
Most Difficult
Decision I've ever made
mm
Event that I could erase from my memory I could not really think of one that I could think of that would be so terrible that I would need to
"delete it again everything for me is a learning experience, so there is nothing really to regret or delete"
"Uh very easy, once I hit the pillow, I'm out"
uh
great uh a little more
uh
physical exertion as normal
but uh still great

for my life and I'm only grateful for everything that comes into it

Very smart uh
very loving uh very intelligent

"Uh, going out."
That's probably what my friends would say
There's really nothing I think I need
"<Laughter> to do, have or be different uh about myself"
as if I were okay with everything as it is
I really am
< slaughter>
what advice I would have given myself ten or twenty years ago
to know
um
to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago
was important in terms of the development of the person I am now
and
so simple
be able to go with the river and go with the experiences of life to be able to
learn to move effortlessly through any situation that arises
Recently really enjoyed
uh
Uh cooked a very wonderful meal
Because I love to cook
So that was something I really enjoyed
