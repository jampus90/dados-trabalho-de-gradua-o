I took the train cooled in San Francisco hung with some of my middle school friends for hell long
then uh yeah it was crazy I was just walking usually I ride a bike everywhere but I was just like walking
this all the time and
it was cool I was crazy exploring
I was going to I came back home finally then after that I went straight to texas
and made some shows on the way to texas and stayed there for eight days
"and that was it was knarr, it was crazy"
"I don't even know, man, there was so much that you know I had fun."
"I went to this place, the salt sea."
and me some of my bike friends we around <sniffle>
We got into cars and went far out into the desert and we around
"Yes, it was tight, we burned things, we burned a car, we drove the car it was like a street warrior type of car"
And it was it crazy man
"Like it was like fifteen niggers on a car, like we went naked into a creek."
I have Hölla shrooms did Hölla Molly
a ridiculous amount of grass smoked
was left behind drunk
"Someone wanted to give me some mescaline I didn't want, but it was like March."
before I went on the other trip that was like the forerunner
to my other trip it was the Salton Seafaring
"but yes, it was tight"
I saw a lot of nudity this trip
"Yeah, really."
I'm fucking absent.
Going out for safe
Smoke herb
< slaughter>

"Um, um..."
oh i studied <Laughter> about photography and photojournalism
and uh
"Yeah, yeah, that's it."
must use the computer free of charge
must use baller ass cameras for free
"And I would just a little uh I would do man on the street kind of shit with students not man on the street, but the where you take her picture and it's like"
I forgot what they said it was a long time ago.
Not anymore.
This
Being me and just hanging out
I rape what I do.
I do small shows all over the country and I have a little fan base
"and I'm just always you know, just do that only art I draw"
my dream job is not working a job and am I
This is the dream job of getting paid for me.
"Well, that's it."
I'm pretty good.
like two weeks ago I was at this after hours
one I was already like super drunk and two it was after hours
Three it was like after hours
Man I had some pens
"These guys took away my pens < clears throat> Pens in my like Fanny Pack I had like a Fanny Pack, so I had pens in there because I'm doing art"
he's how close dog you can't record this and I'm like
All right.
I'll just leave her here and I'll get her when I get out and he was fine.
I'm coming out and they're gone
Accidentally overturning a beer
"And he gets mad at me, he's like you have to go now, and I'm like it's not my fault, that's your fault, but then"
"But then, while that happened"
my homie was attacked by these three great old security guards
And then you know when I saw them attacking my friend when I really lost him.
"And I and he and I should rather let go of my friend now, he's like what you're going to do, and I'm like what you're going to do and then how he threw me to the ground"
"then I and no, he had his arm over me, I put my arm over him and threw him on the ground and then it was broken"
But that was the last time
I got angry.
it was cool it was fun
Life
you know
huh I made <gibberish>
Perhaps this situation could have been handled differently.
"It could have been handled differently if they had handled things differently, then I wouldn't have to react."
It's not like I was angry that I was distracting from the reaction that I had to react like that.
"because like justice, like I couldn't, it was unjust, it was like"
"I'm not a mean person at all, but when I saw"
one of my loved ones being attacked I had to come
and how you know how to react that
And they were the hot ones
"You know what I mean, I was like yo ye niggas tripping like yo"
chill out this is a tiny little white guy
"You're a huge Mexican nigga, like you're falling back."
"You know what I mean, it was crazy."
< slaughter>
Guilty
"I don't know that when I'm hungry, I'm gonna steal shit from business."
when I don't have money
"I guess I'm not really guilty because I don't really know, yes I don't feel guilty about"
Food should be free
know what I mean
But...
"Yeah, I don't know."
I lie I guess I lie <l> Everyone lies sometimes I lie sometimes
Perhaps a little bit as idle here and there exaggerations
Okay <ok>
nah nah never
the toughest
I guess...
"I don't really know what the toughest decision was, but I get confronted with tough decisions"
and that would be like
I have so many friends sometimes
I can't really hang out with everyone on a weekend
"So it's like I have to make decisions, like I'm going through this sector of the city."
I'm going to hang out with x y z niggas when I go over here x y z niggas so it's like
"Hard, you know."
These are tough decisions because I never let anyone down.
so uh yeah stuff like the decision to hang between friends with
ouch
It's cool that I live with my mom.
I come home like every three to four days
So I am
Who
what can you repeat the question
um
my aunt
"Oh, she's just very nice, she's like a little blind old lady."
that cooks really good
and it's tight I don't know
something I could erase from my memory
I wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory
'Cause it's gonna be like
because how
the experiences you're going through make you who you are
I think weak people want to delete things or block things like
"There's no way, I mean, there's shit that was tough."
But I would never say I wouldn't want this to happen
Because you know you have to learn from experience that you know I want to make you better.
All this shit is like a test you know.
This bad experience is just a test you have to overcome
and be stronger and not like curls on and be like oh my God life is hard oh
You know that shit's for weak people.
I don't believe in it.
I have compassion for people who
"who want to do something like that, but I still like it"
I don't see logic in it
mm
"I mean, I stay up pretty late doing all kinds of reckless ass shit so uh, but when I'm home"
"And it's pretty easy, I could just go to sleep"
"You know, when I get tired, I get tired"
"Yeah, that's good."
lately I've been on this as I've been celebrating hell hard lately like oh my God for at least six days
how to come today to do this conversation with you
was the first time that I was able to come back to the qualer city since as Friday
Because I was in town and then it was like Cinco de Mayo
And it was like you knew random ass parties I went to with buddies.
Smoking ridiculous amounts of cigarettes drinking beer
"Shit, made some Mollys."
"Shit, made some coke."
Shit was crazy yo it was just like uh
It was a rock star weekend
or one week
or
Type of material
This is post-traumatic stress syndrome.
No I didn't
I have not been going on
But I'm getting
Oh I mean shoot Saturday I was hella happy
< slaughter>
It was great.
but I was under the influence so
But it was still great you know I was crazy empathic
For example:
Crazy like a flirty
mm I was freestyling like a g I was like kicking hella rimes <sniffle>
It was Dope you know.
analyze my life realized some things I'm going to change about my life and uh yeah it was I had a ball it was great
it was awesome i <xxx>
"Oh, yeah, that's it."
no
I didn't even have a crazy comedown.
I'm like I'm cool
"I definitely won a few pounds from last week I've drunk a lot of beer I feel a little foreign, but except that"
It's me.
Ready
It's okay.
I don't know how a lovable guy
People love me Man they like me not they love me
And this shit is crazy
"I'm just trying to be happy, I'm trying to make people happy, and you just know,"
"its really posi-core, as you have said"
how this is hella positive <p> positive you know
Man I really don't wish I could think I'd lose weight I think it's about
but except that I mean that I ride a bike every day like my legs are pretty strong
Maybe I'd just get more buff in my arm
"but that's the only thing I would change and I don't really <r> I'm not really in a hurry to change that, like if that happens just living through me and I ride a bike more"
"then yes cool, but I don't know <n> I'm not you know abrupt change I don't need, I'm sure my gradual change"
But I'm not I don't know yes
"I wouldn't change anything, but if I was, but really nothing, because I'm chilling right now"
uh
I don't know that I broke up with something like that.
in August that felt bad about me I think
"And yes, it was just someone I wanted to go out with, but they just broke up with me and like this shit sucks."
but that was probably the last time I felt really bad <Cough>
What exactly do you want to know about it?
"Oh, how..."
"I don't know that we just went out and then she was just fucking jealous and sometimes walked through my cell phone accusing me of shit, but then she ended up with me"
Just because she wanted to snoop around with other people.
and that was the relationship at a glance
"Life sucks, you have to adapt and change the man."
know what I mean
Don't walk away from it and walk to what you said.
"Yeah, that bitch gave me s_t_ds shit"
That's the only thing I regret
"Yeah, man, it's a cold game"
But I got the shot it was cool I'm like boom clean
But so is it.
I don't know that she's a cool person we're still hanging out with.
you know
she loses further I'll just keep winning know what I mean
"do not run away from him, do not run to him, know what I mean"
< slaughter>
wait wait ten or twenty years ago
I was only seven years old you what I say my seven-year-old self
"he wouldn't be able to understand the advice I'd give, what did you say?"
Oh oh oh yeah he wouldn't be able to understand the advice I'd give him
I'd be like
Just to fuck
Read a little more books or something guy like
uh
"I don't know, man fucking it's gonna be okay, you're you, you're great, just hold"
You do cool shit and you have a ball
I don't know.
I don't know.
"I wouldn't want to change, and that's why I'm saying that."
because
If I told my young self to do something else
I wouldn't have grown into the person I'm now
even being able to say something to my young self
if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all the shit are real and time travel you know
everything I do in the past
will
"this life would be a variable now, so I'm going back there"
"tell him to do something differently, the course of the story and then the time stream that I may not cease to exist"
You know what I'm saying so I don't want to.
I'm just gonna be like I'm gonna screw up even more.
but yeah make more mistakes because the only way
To be a better person is to make hellish mistakes you know
at least the
at least that's like my ruthless state of mind like you when you screw it up
Because you'll learn more from it
You know they say what they say
around experience is the best professor
"You know what I'm saying, that's basically what this is, how I think you know what I mean."
< sniffle>
I'm proud of this life that I'm here to do things like this <Laughter>
Like I'm so excited
"I was all over the country, I was on people's albums."
I write I do voiceover work from time to time
and yes I people know me I rap I ride bikes
I've infiltrated several
I subculture my subcultures and types of people in the city
Scrubbed_entry
"And I don't know, man."
"I guess it's like I'm living my life like I'm running for mayor, but I'm not really running for mayor, I'm just to be the best I can be"
So I kiss my hands and shake babies on the way and it was a great time
and it could only become bigger and better
< sniffle>
Are you sure?
woah
This is crazy.
See you.
I love you
<Laughter> You love yourself too
"That's tight, should I press the button now or what"
