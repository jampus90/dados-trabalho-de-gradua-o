I am originally from los angeles california
"I like the weather, I like a lot of things"
"Uh, the women."
Such things
Traffic is ridiculous as if it were out of control like
the way people drive here
Economy
uh I just wanted to be an entrepreneur how I wanted to work for myself
So that's why I did this.
"Yeah, I'm just..."
<tisk> uh to be a c_e_o of a company
"It shouldn't be that hard, but it'll be a challenge. It's a challenge."
Don't get me wrong
"I mean sometimes it varies I can be shy sometimes, but then I'm mostly starting"
"Sure, I mean, when it comes to certain things like say,"
"I'm going to a club or a party and I see a girl I want to talk to, I'm going to talk to her."
but when it comes to a lot of people like sometimes I get a little shy and uh reserved
"Uh, I'm training"
Hanging out with my friends
That's what I do
"I'm pretty good at it, I don't really let things come to me"
It's been a while since I didn't argue with anyone.
I had like a little little
"little argument about something, but uh, that was a few weeks ago and"
"It wasn't something that was serious, it's just..."
some things I had to clarify with uh someone
"It was about a girl, and I asked her a few questions about a few things."
"why she tried, uh"
Come back with her ex like this doesn't make any sense to me
um
<lip smacking> I'd say my relationship with my brother I wish we didn't have uh
I wish we could have done that.
without fighting each other
my relationship with my family is pretty cool like my mother who I am with my mother <sniff>
"And I get along with my sister, so it's pretty it's pretty uh"
Cool
"I'm pretty, I'm very close to my family."

"I would have to say, at the moment, my weight as i"
I put on a few pounds and I'm working on losing those pounds.
