I like that.

Meeting with other people and learning about their environment and cultures
The last trip I made outside of here was to Italy.
and
that was my second time to be there
and
I enjoyed it more this time.
because
I knew what I wanted to see when I came back and...
and I was better prepared
for
Italians and their culture I felt
"I wasn't like you know I was better prepared, I thought"
for this trip
<freezes the neck>
That would be
To be in the country and see a very small house
in the middle of
Hectares and hectares and hectares of grapes were only
Magnificent
Human Development
I didn't decide to do that.
started the school with the intention of being a lactation consultant
and I went to a program
in which you get a degree as well as your license to become a lactation consultant
and through the process I learned that I had to do a long internship without paying and at the time <t> and I miss
"I had one family, so I had to make another career choice fast"
and so the college offered
human development as an important
And I...
just walked right in and used my used <u> used my units that I had already purchased
on this particular important and
and I'm happy with it
currently no I stay at home I have a little
"Well, he's not so small that I'm ready to get back to work."
um
in the meantime I design jewelry
"Well, I've got three"
Children around I have an almost four-year-old and then I have two older children
seventeen and twenty-three
no
so that your children are the love of them and for them unconditionally
All the steps they go through are stages all the time.
for each age < slaughter>
and then everyone in my household is different because they are different ages
so
I think I'm probably more in line with these different levels
That's why it drives me crazy.
"Um, and I think my parents were parents back when my parents were,"
It was just like
"You know she's fed, she's dressed."
"She has a house, I mean a roof over her head"
and we do it great as parents and we love them and so
It wasn't about there wasn't too much I felt the parents thought about
"that in terms of education in this way and as you know today, there are books for every age"
every year month
"You know, ""throws out"" and ""rounds out."""
So I think it's different in this way

It was my husband and it was about
um
he asked me if I ever thought of cheating in our marriage
of him
Uh really tired to talk about the same subject
um
Now it came from < f> from
"a client of my husband, who is a woman, and she told him that she had cheated on her husband for a year because she had upset him."
many things
and around <free throat>
And so he took this information and came home
and decided to ask me if I ever thought about it and what
Think of fraud and
He knows I upset him.
and that made me feel like it made me cheat or thought about cheating
< emptied the throat> and around <sigh>
We've talked a lot.
"and uh I don't just mean that, but"
I don't just know about fraud in general
and all the more so I just said what I
Usually says that I don't
um
and that i
have thought about it when we were together for the first time
and uh but it was just a thought
and
um
And then his answer was I know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell each other
and that just kind of
<sigh> I guess I'm irritated I was really disturbed by that
And I was just thinking you know we're having this conversation again.
and why do we have this conversation <Laughter>
You are the one who cheats and so it is
the
went to
That...
Argument I mean it wasn't ayelling <y> Screaming I mean it was part entertainment and part SMS

Don't speak

mm
almost every situation that affects my children and when I screamed
because I really don't like
"When I got to the point where I screamed more, it bothers me because"
I was yelled at.
Much
and I just
feel bad about it and i
try really hard to not
"any kind of situation that affects my children, no matter how excited I get"
and lead to scream
hmm
that would be likely to keep
pregnancy or not
"Yeah, that's good."
"- Yeah, I know."
I didn't talk about it until yesterday.
and
"Oh, I was pregnant and"
I didn't want to be married and I wanted to be married
and I just...
Didn't think it was the right time for me
and
I had
Pretty much made my decision that I wouldn't keep this pregnancy
but I've made the decision myself
And when my partner found out uh that I was pregnant
he said he wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me
and so this decision was pretty hard
because I felt obliged to do so
and felt super guilty to not
and
<drops microphone> oops
and uh
this is correct to
hang on this earpiece falls
That's where we're going.
that was probably the hardest decision you actually know what no
"I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I've ever had to make, I'm sorry the hardest decision I've had to make"
was in my life whether or not < clear throat>
The hospital was supposed to kill life.
or a life support machine for my father
or not
that was the hardest decision
Because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that
and to have been
to draw on the situation in which he was
"not able to do anything at all, either speak"
for itself
was beyond
who he was and I just couldn't see him
like that more and he would be a vegetable that I was told
So I agreed
to track that
not
hardly ever

Too many things are going around my head
and pretty much around
mostly on weekends because my older children are traveling with their friends
Even if I
"I know they're coming, I mean, I'm worried all the time."
"Uh, how they are when they come home and so I really can't sleep on weekends most of the time"
But...
and you sometimes it's just so many days not a good night's sleep I'm just exhausted <ex> I faint
but it's hard
very stressed
My son is...
