value
Yes
I do it pretty well <Laughter>
I'm from Oklahoma.
mhm
yup oklahoma city
Uh the weather is great I love it near the ocean and palm trees and uh mountains I just love it here <Laughter>
"It was pretty easy, there are a few differences it is a huge city compared to where I'm out of so traffic is definitely an adaptation for me <Laughter>"
I just wanted to live in California. I hate being locked up in Oklahoma. I just wanted to go to the west coast near the ocean.
I studied psychology and minor art
"No, not right now."
"I think I misunderstood your question, but I'm not working on my degree yet, but I'm working on psychology."
My dream job oh
"I don't really know, I think I just want to help people, but I can and um"
"I like to work with people in the field of psychology, so I think I might already have my dream job <Laughter>"
to relax I like to read or watch movies around I like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends
Things that really drive me crazy... probably injustice to other people
"People who are abused or abused and people who are lied and deceived, including myself, I hate to be lied to <Laughter>"
"when I'm upset uh depends on the situation, but"
I'm just trying
"how to count to ten and take a deep breath and let my emotions react to me in a negative way, so I'm just trying to calm down before I say anything"
um
"it depends again on the situation and how I'm angry at around most of the time I'm pretty good at controlling it, but sometimes I think like"
like most people I turn to the people I'm closest to times and and these moments I'm not so good at controlling it
When was the last time I had a fight with someone?
It was probably with my parents.
I've been having some problems with the car lately and
"I'm also slow with money, so I'm sure I don't even remember exactly, but I'm sure we probably fought over the fact that"
I know that I have to take care of my own <Laughter> things like car problems.
"I'm very close to my family, they're still in Oklahoma, but I'm talking to them on the phone all the time"
Oh definitely I mean
"My mom, I think she's probably the person I'm closest to and she's just"
"She's a great role model, she's a wonderful person and she's very diligent and very selfless and I just want to be like her."
oh
probably the time I went bungee jump over the Nile river in uganda
"I still have flashbacks from this moment, just falling free, it was like the coolest experience ever and I love doing things that are crazy, so it was a funny time <Laughter>"
"Yes, well, I've travelled a lot these days, I'm not travelling that much anymore, but I've been working for a cruise line around Norwegian cruise line and so I'd go"
travel with them all the time and then I also have an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so I just went and helped in different third countries it was really cool
"uh I love to go to different places, see new places and meet all different types of people around"
because it is easy to simply be included in your own little bubble that you forget that there is a huge world and there is
all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet these types of people and just see the
Diversity and the terrain of the earth also and the way the earth looks in different places is cool
"No, I didn't serve in the military <Laughter>"
Yes
"No, I've never been formally diagnosed, although I'd say I've probably diagnosed myself with depression just after studying it a lot in psychology, during the years I've been"
"I'm probably ninety-nine percent sure I've struggled with depression from time to time, so yeah"
"lately it's been pretty easy, but over the years I've definitely had a lot of problems with insomnia around just like either not being able to fall asleep"
"or just as constantly waking up all night and so now I'm not really experiencing too much of it, but in the past it's definitely an ongoing topic for me"
I'm not a pleasant person when I don't sleep well Sleep is extremely important to me I think maybe more than a lot of people I like need good sleep to work
I feel really good.
"In the last few months, I've been unemployed after I got out of here and"
"this was really tough around and I just offered my job around just like last week, so I definitely think I've gone through"
"a lot of crap and just a lot of depression, but it's like I've picked up a lot of it because I don't have that pressure anymore, how will I end up hitting this city really expensive and I don't have a job and"
so I feel much more relieved than I had the feeling that's good <Laughter>
"I mean, just like I said last week, or so I've become a lot more."
Positive I was kind of like a feeling like a hermit in a way it's just hard to be like in a new city and not really know too many people and
"Of course, as I said, not having a job leads to"
Type of
"like in your own bowl I think, and that was kind of like it was like it was like it was like for me and just since I got the job offered I just got so much more"
"Trust and like positivity that things start to train for me, which is good <Laughter>"
"Oh, it was probably a few days ago actually I was going around"
I went to explore a part of the South Bay that I hadn't really been before and
it was I just wanted to go on a jogging along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and
"It was just beautiful and then I went for a ride of this kind like cliff, where there is beautiful scenery that I've never seen before and I just"
"how overwhelmed was how beautiful it was and I was just like oh I can't believe I can live here, so that was definitely a happy moment for me <Laughter>"
my best friend would probably say that I am very daring and
bold and fearless about
that I am unique
and artistic
"and I wouldn't suspect that she would probably say that I'm a non-conformist, I don't really think the way many people do and I question everything that can be a good or bad thing, but yeah < laugh>"
um 
likely
Just like
the fact that I really try to live my life with no regrets and just try to make a very
exciting life in a way and I think that especially since I finished college and travel as I have and
"I've tried to move all the different places from myself, so I just think the fact that I'm not really afraid that I'm not letting things hold back I just want something or if I want to do something, I can just do it and"
"I think in a way I like that about me and the fact that I'm really independent and can just go and do what I want, even though it's hard I'm still proud that I've overcome a lot of these fights"
"Oh, there's like little things I regret all my life, but there's nothing really important, because I think pretty much everything I've done, I've learned whether it's good or bad so"
I wouldn't change anything.
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,"
I'd say I'd tell myself when I was a kid that I
should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything someone says stop me from believing that anything is possible because
um
"I guess when I grew up to be an adult, I really saw and started to believe that really everything is possible and if you really want something, you can go after it and you can get it, so I would just"
Tell me never to give up and just always believe that you can do whatever you want.
oh 
"Let's see, that's kind of tough <Laughter>"
"Um, I guess,"
I recently went home for Christmas back to Oklahoma and to see some of my friends from college I hadn't seen in some of them I hadn't seen how since
I graduated so much as four years ago.
"It was really great, just going out with them and we went to dinner and we went out later and had only a good night and it was really really fun"
Cool
You're welcome.
See you.
