I_a <l> let's go close but
I currently reside <res>Residence in Inglewood
"Wait, did I answer your question?"
I don't know.
All right.
"OJ L 157, 15.6.2011, p. 1."
um
wall paintings
the sea
What else is it?
the people
My family's over here.
This is the best part
What about you?
"Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
um
I'd say
The Smog
"Yeah, the air could be cleaner."
and
"Yeah, that's good."
um
that's pretty <pre> I mean
There are also good and bad people.
"but yes, for the most part it's all good"
"Yes, I was in Mexico and the temples."
and Northern California so yes
Travel
like clean air that is good it is healthier for your body
Clean blood flow
who are for people
Culture
"and stories and when you come back, share stories like your friends"
"Yeah, anytime."
like now
or if:
"Okay, like this one time I was little, we went to the temples."
and it started to rain
"So let's just start going through and like if we got to the top of a thing I didn't know before, the higher you go, the higher you go."
the smaller the steps become
so
how people had it back then
Uh smaller feet
So what happened was
as I went higher towards the temple I had to walk sideways
so that my feet could measure up to the steps
"but when you get up there, it's a nice view"
I don't know what to do.
"General education, but"
Mainly Art
"Yes, I've taken a lot of art lessons"
"Uh, good."
When I was a child
"I crawled on walls with chalk, so I thought you know how it kind of stuck with me"
I was just following it.
so
"Yeah, that's good."
My dream job
would be paid for painting
Painting Art
"Yeah, that's good."
um
"Yeah, that's good."
Pretty simple
um
"It's not so much that it's hard, it just needs passion"
um
Persistence
and faith and will
"You just really have to believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself, the more likely you are to be successful"
mhm
I think I'm shy in some way
Time and Places
but I'm also going out when
how I have the energy
so
I have a feeling it's well balanced.
as if I were shy when it
I guess...
"Okay, to be shy"
you know
and I'll go when
like the need to actually
to have fun or just to explore
It feels good like
"if that makes sense, but yes"
< slaughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
to relax
um
"I don't know if I should say that, but I smoke weeds <Laughter>"
so this helps
and
I like painting painting pretty much helps me relax
You know especially when I blue the color
because the color blue relaxes around me
and also green
"when I use these two colors and take a picture, it calms me"
"Yeah, and you got a blue shirt, yeah."
My temperament
to good my thoughts
my thoughts control my feelings
and my feelings
"Yeah, that's pretty much like that"
"my temper, I'm trying to make sense, you know, how good it is to go crazy"
"or when I get angry, what will be the result"
you know
so
Controlling my temperament is easy
through the formation of my thought
To <sigh>
The last time I had a fight with someone
was with my father
"and it was because I wanted to eat, but he wanted me to buy wine"
"So right, when the food was ready, I was hungry to eat and he was like no"
so that somehow frustrations me
and
the way I treated it was how good
I could just eat when I get back and I'll do him a favor.
you know
"And then, after you know that I could just eat in peace"
so
"Yeah, that's good."
my family
It's pretty good.
um
my mother my father have a good relationship still < s> still married
and my brothers and sisters
We help each other out
"So that's good, it's just"
"Yeah, it's like a team."
a situation I wish I could handle differently
hmm
That's a good question.
"I mean,"
can I get a scenerio
All right.
um
a situation I could deal with differently
"Now see, that's the thing, how I feel like"
"If I'm quiet in any situation, I could find out."
"You know, but when it came to a Rubik cube"
Maybe
How would I deal with the situation just by
Uh fail uh fail make mistakes
because I would make the right mistakes and follow the right lessons
so
This is the best way to answer your question.
you know
"Yeah, that's good."
a positive influence
Pretty much.
Anyone who told me the truth was a positive influence you know.
For example:
"Yes, even if it may hurt like oh the truth hurts"
"Well, they're not trying to be mean, they're actually"
"good influences, so I would say my friends"
"My mom, my dad."
my brother my sisters
"Yeah, that's good."
mm
"See, that's kind of like"
You like me I've had some pretty bad experiences with as on shot tip and with a knife
"But at the end of the day, what it did was to give me more insight, it made me more conscious"
and
it taught me how to read people a little more like
"easy to feel things and also how to avoid situations so, although it was bad and it kind of like"
Scare me
It prepared me like
"the world you know because that happened to me when I was twelve thirteen years old, so I was already exposed like"
"You know, like rifle knives and all that stuff."
"It's bad, but it's good in the long run."
You know it because
when you get out of the burglary
It's like
"Nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know it in your head like oh I've been through worse, so it's not so bad that you know"
and
So yes.
the toughest
um
Man
see this right now uh for a moment when I was stuck I was like trying to think that was that was part of it
but uh toughest decision as far as life changes
Lives
whether the school should continue
Higher education
or not
mm i somehow chosen
to like
"I went to school, but I decided to pursue my own like"
I learn more by connecting with people who are already in the field where I want to be.
"So that was a tough choice, because there is no"
In order to guarantee that I
For example:
how to run the right people
"But I took the risk, and you know I met the right people."
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's good."
It's really very simple
Sometimes it's like I could sleep in ten minutes.
I could turn my mind off like I'm just calming down.
How slow down my air patterns
"Yeah, that's good."
mhm
lately
I felt
Good
I feel like I have free will.
how at this point in time I feel like
when I have chosen a path
Of a kind used in the manufacture of motor vehicles
My heart
I could
You know you're here.
But I'm kind of like
still decide it's like everything in all these paths in the air
"I'm just trying to make my own, I don't know."
that's where I'm at I feel like I have free will
So yes.
lately as in the last two weeks or today
< slaughter>
All right.
"- Yeah, you know."
um
"Yeah, that's good."
Things happen that would change like
my feelings and
"For example, right now it just happened"
What are you doing?
for now as
this experience for one is like a shift in my mind
because
"Yeah, it's like"
it's technology you know it's like a journey to see how far
For example:
you could think about it
and then do it
Reality
So that's kind of like moving my thoughts right now
this experience this whole experience
"Yeah, that's good."
Uh post-traumatic stress disorder
no
Depression I know what it's like to be depressed
but diagnosed by a doctor
Depression
How
how it feels
How does depression feel?
It feels like
It's like a bird in a cage
Being depression is like
a fish that cannot swim in the water
I feel like depression is like a bird without wings
um
Pretty much it feels
As if you were limited.
But then the thing is
To get out of this depression
It's like you have to
Awaken and change your perspective
and focus on
as I would say colors help colors
and help people who talk to people
"Yeah, that's good."
be depressed
mm let's see
mm
I don't know.
For example:
"It could come as if it could happen every day, like in small doses."
so
as I could say today you know earlier when I was just alone I felt a little depressed
but then what happened I fixed it like
called a friend and
met with him and yeah
"I mean, at this moment, I feel pretty happy that you know."
"I'm talking to a virtual person, it's pretty cool"
and
"Yeah, that's good."
Now I feel happy.
< slaughter>
um
sometimes hard head
Like he's trying to teach me...
"a certain lesson, whether it's art"
or as in my character
and
"Yeah, he'd probably just describe me like that."
For example:
For example:
he would listen
but at the same time he will still do what he wants to do
Pretty much like
I don't know.
"Yeah, I mean, that's what he's telling me"
but yeah overall good person
probably just exercise
around my diet food
my food intake
"and yes, just movement"
Pretty much it
my health
mm
I'd say when I was in middle school.
or
Elementary
also a little high school
but what it would
"Yes, what it would be, it would be either"
um
good pretty much my art <Laughter>
like if I ever did something and I thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kind of like
Like garbage
And then I'd be like oh
Damn it.
either I could accept it and be like yeah it somehow looks and then fix it
Or what I'd do back then would be like fucking you know
Just linger on that thought.
and then just like
Stay a little while and I'll finally get out.
Of course.
"Most of the time, it's people's words."
and ideas
the
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's it."
Regret
"Yes, I have some things I regret"
Like what?
All right.
Sometimes I feel like I should have finished a whole university thing.
but
I mean at the same time I feel like
if I really wanted to go
I had been going
So yes.
That's some kind of regret in my head
Ten or twenty years ago would be to seek spiritually
Feeling comfortable
you know
learn how to choose your thoughts your thoughts I would teach myself
um
Choose the right people you surround yourself with because it definitely has a big influence in your environment
uh certain events that you would experience
and as far as your general happiness
"Yeah, that's good."
"yeah among other things, but yeah"
what I'm most proud of right now
is my painting
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm proud of it because
I feel like these pictures I'm releasing are things no one else could duplicate.
"You know, it's like it's some kind of thing and it's like where you know it."
"It has its own signature, so"
"So yeah, I'm pretty happy about it"
"Yes, thank you very much."
"All right, thank you."
mhm
Goodbye.
