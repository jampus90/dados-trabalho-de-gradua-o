I'm fine.
new jersey
Yes
Three months ago
not very often
It's a lot different.
uh
"I don't know, it's just <Laughter> it's a lot more crowded here"
to start a new life for me
It wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh
It was...
"It was pretty hard at first, but I'm still trying to get used to life here."
I met some good friends here.
um
"You know, I love the Hollywood area around"
"And only you know the mountains are beautiful, they're kind of things I love"
hmm
Transport
not really no I don't
just didn't have the time or the finances to
digital media
All right.
I've always loved you.
< deep breath> computer and you know to design things and uh I don't know that I somehow fell into it
no
I got out.
"Well, I guess my dream job would work in something that"
Uh I went to school for you know I've never really completed my education
um
"But I guess it would be great if I went, you know it back to school, and you know, ready you know my"
Completion in digital media
And you know I'm done.
and uh started working you know something to do in this area
"a little of both you know that sometimes I can be shy, but"
"I like to push myself to leave me, you know it's a fight for me, but"
"I don't want you to know it in a shell, so I kind of force myself to be out"
I hear music sometimes I just drive and around
"You know, playing music in my car and that helps me relax"
or I smoke a cigarette
oh like what oh um <Laughter>
"Just heavy metal, that's all I hear is metal."
Good <sigh>
It's all about it.
how high my stress level is and how angry I am
but i
I'm doing my best to
not so pissed on <Laughter>
Scrubbed_entry
and
I don't know if she's...
She wanted me to pick her up.
She was a little drunk.
and uh we somehow fought over the phone all over some other things and
I just didn't pick her up.
because of her attitude on the phone with me
"Yeah, that's good."
it shall:
something I feel guilty about is not talking to my children
common
or as often as I should
I was just so busy trying to
I don't really have time to find my way around here.
You know I talk to my kids as much as I want.
you have no idea
um
"It comes naturally, but it's not easy"
and it's the hardest job I love to do
but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away
and I made this choice to come here
And I feel bad that I don't see them you know
but
The reason I got out of here was to improve myself so I could take care of her.
Anxiety
you know
Fear <f> Only fear you will know that you are afraid of what will happen to your children you fear
the
Something terrible is going to happen
and
they do not see
brings forth this fear much more
"You know, and I can't always be there with them, I can't see them, you know"
It wasn't that bad when I lived in Florida.
um
and I at least saw her
"It wasn't very often, but I used to see her, now I don't see her at all"
and
That's the hardest thing I've had.
Doing as a Parent
is
Get away from my kids if I just don't know for a while how long I'll be here.
I don't know what my future will bring
but
"The hardest part is,"
So far away from them
"only the joy they bring me, I mean, I could have a bad day"
And they're just firing me up
"I mean,"
i eh
"It's annoying to be away from them for so long, and they're so far away"
"and do not see their faces,"
It's the worst thing you've ever known.
but
i
I love to see their faces that just bring a smile to my face
and
I don't know.
"Well, um..."
I think
the fact that I can
up to their level
um
I'm a little silly <laughter>
"as a father, when my father was with me, my father was"
"You know, strictly safe all the time that he knows you, laugh and play with us, but"
You know he was always very reserved.
you know
"and he held a lot, he held a lot of his emotions just because"
"You know he was a strong, very tough guy."
um
but with me I am very silly and stupid with my children and I am strict when I have to be
but
I always love it
You know you're playing around with them.
as much as possible
you don't know
I don't want them growing up too fast.
and that this may
"Yeah, that's good."
Good <sigh>
a situation I wish I had treated differently
There are so many <Laughter>
uh
I guess when I was still with my ex-wife
in florida
I wish I hadn't
got so angry or I wish I hadn't let her get the best out of my emotions
She had a tendency to
go under my skin
And you know it
Pick me until I'm ready.
I exploded.
and
I allowed her to do that.
"You know, I just would've"
left when I could
And you know I can't get the best of myself.
no
no
no
Sometimes it's hard.
um
"sometimes I just lay awake in bed you know, thinking all the things going through my mind all you know, all the stress that I'm going through"
with work and you know
ensure that:
"You know, I wonder if I'll be able to give you the rent?"
You know what my kids are going through?
Do you know when I'll see her again if she even takes care of me?
when they know they have a father
you know
these are some of the things that run through my mind and
And that sometimes stops me at night
a little <sigh> but <sigh>
You know I got into this situation.
You know I have to
You know I have to take it.
"You know that you reap what you sow, so i <sigh>"
I have to deal with this my way.
lately
um
I tried to
Don't think so much about
You know everything that goes into my life
I'm trying to distract myself
and this kind of
"get me in a better mood, you know if I'm hanging out with friends or"
Look at something to get me distracted by you.
all the burdens in my life
um
the last time I felt really happy
uh
was actually a few nights ago I went drinking around
with some of my friends from work and around
I don't know.
We just...
pretty drunk and simple <Laughter>
That kind of helped me forget
All the crap that was there.
before went through my head
"So if I can distract myself, if I can forget all this"
Other material
then I am happy <sigh>
some of my best qualities I think I'm convinced <Laughter>
um
I'm kind of like a
I guess you'd say a consultant to some people you know some of my close friends
you know
"I like to persuade people to do things they can regret, or I mean, I'm sorry to talk to people about things they might regret in the end."
or I can
You know you only listen to people so you know.
I could say that you know that I definitely know you're listening to my friends and helping them in their time of need when they're going through something.
Scary times like I'm going through
Scrubbed_entry
uh who lives in florida
You know I talk to him every once in a while and
He's having trouble with his girlfriend and
You know I'm just kind of
To talk to him about his problems and listen to me mostly <mo> I hear mainly because you know that I don't think he has anyone else to listen to.
Do you know when I was living in Florida?
I was very close to him so you know he always relied on me.
and now that I'm here in l_a
"I don't want to lose you knowing the connection to him, because I mean, I've always been there for him, so..."
He... he... he... he... he... he... he... he... he...
he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him advice
You know what I think you know he should.
um
"So I think, <th> I think he appreciates that and I and I'm glad he knows you rely on me for that"
He trusts me enough to tell me all this.
I don't know.
Sometimes I wish I wasn't like that
kind or generous
"it seems bad, but sometimes I don't know that people can take advantage of me"
and I can't see it
and
I don't like to say no to people I like
People always to please
So if I can change that maybe I wish I hadn't fallen such a people
sometimes financially in difficulty <Laughter> <low breath> sometimes I know
you know
help others and don't know you
that can break me sometimes yes I can not have enough to
"Paying invoices, but"
I feel better to help people
I don't know.
I regret
not
Breaking up with my ex-wife earlier
I regret <re> I regret <re>
Because she's been through so much crap in my life
and
I've always tried
"Be a people I like, I tried to please her."
"You know, try,"
Please my children as much as I can
"by not dissolving, you know the family"
but
"You know, there's only so much a person can take."
and I probably think if I left earlier
I could have been happier
and things may not have gotten as out of control as they have done.
you know
during all the years with her
so
Maybe if I got out early.
"I don't know that I would have been happier, I guess."
um
It's okay to be selfish.
It's okay.
you know
Sometimes think of yourself
you know when you keep putting everyone in front of you
"then you don't think about yourself, you don't think about what makes you happy"
and even if
Falling People May Make You Happy
Uh you sometimes have to think about yourself and your needs
because
you know
They play an important role
in
the life of your close family members
and
to keep everything above water
Sometimes you have to worry about the one person who
You know you juggle everything and stop everything you're yourself.
Be a little selfish sometimes it's okay
I don't even know what a weekend is anymore.
my ideal weekend would be
Alone locked up in my room
Watching movies that only listen to music
with my
Turn off mobile phone and
you don't know you're with someone or it could be at a bar
You know or know you see a metal show
so
I like being alone
"But sometimes I want to go out with others, as you know I'm with people."
Crazy <Laughter>
He thinks I'm...
I'm crazy because I got out of here.
but
I guess he'd say I'm committed and I'm strong-minded
"And that you know what I imagined, I can do it, you know it, no matter what."
How hard it is that I won't freak out
so
"I mean, I really respect him for giving me his insight."
"But I guess, yeah, I guess he'd say that I"
"crazy, but"
Strong-minded <Laughter>
my children <sigh>
"You know, this is the one thing that brings me joy that you know as real joy."
are my children and
"You know, having her in my life is the"
The proudest thing I can ever achieve is that you know that she's
in my life
and even though I don't see her so much
"Even though I'm thinking of them, they're just thinking of you."
How far they've gone
you know
what they have achieved in their you know
in her short time I mean anyway it makes me happy
And I can't wait to see her again
one of my most memorable experiences
I guess that would be
Scrubbed_entry
in florida
You know to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch
"It was a great night overall you know, one of the night I'll never forget"
just because we were looking forward to you knowing so many months and
"You know, when it finally happened, it was surreal."
um
it was a great night after all and overall
sure that you are welcome
See you.
