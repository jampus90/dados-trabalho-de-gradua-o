value
Yes
Today is my daughter's birthday.
california
Yes
around the beach
I love the water
the violence of the gangs
Violence
I've lost a lot of friends growing up.
around through primary school and high school
only to lose them through gang violence
"Yes, thank you very much."
It was pretty hard out there <Laughter>
um
"hasn't been to any place in California yet, so not really."
I'm an optician and a certified optician.
and I also have the degree of my employee
"Uh, actually, I went in."
I didn't really know what I was going to do when I first applied
I only knew that I wanted to change my life and do something successful
before I settled down and you know that my daughter and everything
To actually my consultant somehow helped me and i
I always thought they were so cool because their white long lab coats
To be an optometrist
Because I'm already an optician and that's like the first step
and what I'm asking why is a good question because
then I would be able to have my own business
and I would have something to leave successfully to my daughter
"and she wouldn't really have to want something, it would be like a"
"a family business, but an a to help the Community as well"
and something I could leave for my daughter
My daughter is five years old.
She's going to primary school next week.
and today is her birthday five years ago I had her <Laughter> around her is
"I taught her at home that I taught her for five years, and..."
"She's adorable, she's my heart."
no
That's like the hardest job ever.
It's very hard.
provided
Provision of uh ensure that:
They wash their clothes because I mean it's hard enough.
"to be a parent, but I'm a young parent and"
I'm a little more mature than her father.
It's...
"It's the deployment part I would basically say to make sure you need everything they need, it's so"
"complicated, let alone..."
It gives you enthusiasm to be more to walk the extra mile around
"Even being here today would probably have been in bed, but today's my daughter's party."
and I've tried whatever extra little money I could make you know to
make sure they have a good day so
It's all about going the extra mile.
"to do everything you can to provide <pro> for them, but it is a very hard work"
um
the moment of the day
when your child tells you how much she cares for you
and
my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me I'm her I'm her heart you know and and
how many
"I mean, just call your name it"
It's a sense of reality.
to be called Mother or to call Dad and
"It's just like it's in love with you, it also lets you know what this reality is, that's my life, that's what I'm living now, and"
it is a very good feeling that is the best part of being a parent
Thank you.
um
many different things I actually am
Take care of my daughter <Laughter>
I'm here with her.
I was raised by my grandparents.
"I mean, I didn't really learn that I wasn't my mother until I was sixteen and"
"My father, I mean, I couldn't point him out."
on the street on the sidewalk so I don't know who he is
I can feel it.
"I'm very different from her, because"
No matter how hard the job I always don't give up
"Yeah, that's good."
um
I guess I
There were a lot of different people who were very positive.
in my life I can say
My sister had a good influence on me to get into the medical field.
she's in the uh she's a l_v_a
She's one of my older sisters.
I can say:
I believe in God
Being in my life God has to be in my life
"also keep my strength and know that I do not have to take over this world alone, because God is there for me and"
um
hm
I don't know.
I don't really look up to a lot of different people because
People lie like that
and that's the best I could think that was positive for me
I think I'm going out <Laughter> I used to be shy
"get up as a child, and"
I don't know what happened to me.
one day I just broke out of my bowl and
I was...
Very accurate
shows my personality of <Laughter>
um
I really like it
for
to collapse the waves against the rocks on the beach
and I like to just sit there
"and all the others who are there, just turn them off"
and rub my toes in the sand
and that's so relaxing
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
Excuse me for apologizing.
I've learned not to do it because it's a form of knowing who's in control and it's your life or someone else.
and I feel my temper is controlling my temperament
shows that I am responsible for my life
So I don't even let things come to me
"I don't even really remember the last time I had to control my temper, because that's how much I'm trying to"
negativity
Mm probably my husband < yawn>
My daughter's father...
"Uh probably about how uh you know the dishes or how the little things, but not uh"
physical confrontation as with another person no
Wow
"To be honest,"
I feel somehow guilty
about how things like uh basically ended up like things
"Before my mother died, I wish that"
I could have done it.
helped her a little more
Even if people say I shouldn't feel bad
Because she wasn't really there for me when I grew up.
"But I feel guilty, as you know."
not to be there as much as I could have been for her
Before she died.
I think this is something I still feel guilty for.
um
passes through my mother
um
I felt like...
"Basically, that"
it was I felt somehow
"Robbed in one sense, as I felt that everyone had other parents and"
I grew up with my grandparents and then
for me to go so many years without really knowing mom and dad
to be 18 years old for me and then she leaves me
It was kind of like
"I don't know it was annoying, because"
I felt
You know it was.
I didn't have them all these years and then now that I'm older and I don't even have them now
so
um
Signing the newspaper with a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter
"I was so nervous, so scared."
"To really not know what to do, how to take it"
"And I mean, it's so scary"
It was the safest way to bring my daughter into this world.
Yes
It's hard <Laughter> I didn't even sleep last night
"That's why I'm yawning, but..."
"I tend to,"
try to do everything and I have to get
back to the stage in which
"I have to think about myself, too."
and give me time
"Uh, a little like that."
but actually I'm a little nicer today <Laughter>
um
Only groggy
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
lately I felt very confident
on the need to make a positive contribution to to the
the extra mile of being a good parent
uh
"Yeah, I really don't care what other people think."
"I've always been bothered with it, but not anymore."
no
no
um
"Today, because"
I was so happy that I was
my daughter into this world today on her birthday
to meet people
mhm mm at the moment not
when I go
uh to see who I associate with
my weight <Laughter>
uh
I'd say my grandma
mm
"Um, um..."
It's just...
I'd rather not.
for my daughter
this is my pride and joy
"Wow, thank you."
See you.
