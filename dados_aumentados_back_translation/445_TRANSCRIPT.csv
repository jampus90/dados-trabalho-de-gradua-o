value
<sync>
Yes
I feel great
I'm out of los narrowes california
around the weather
the opportunity
And the sea
It's crowded.
Overpriced
and a little dirty
I've been
good it is nice to see other places in the world and meet other people and cultures
I worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer
and traveled to alaska the Aleutian Islands
korea japan
and the Caribbean Islands
um
be in galena alaska and be in a small plane
and travel in a snowstorm
and surviving
"as if I was on the brink of death and life, but I lived"
the art and economy
I don't know that I was attracted to the arts at a young age.
And the business went with him
Yes
Yes
to be able to entertain people and feel them and earn enough money to have a pleasant life
more outgoing
um
I always feel very confident with my thoughts
and I like people to know what I have to say
I listen to music
And I'm sitting with my girlfriend
and she calms me when I'm stressed
I could work on not being very good at it.
last night
with my girlfriend
she asked my advice on something and
when I talked to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud I wasn't angry
"But I was irritated that I was told to calm down when I didn't really want to help, I just wanted to relax."
<Laughter> I agree
um
"sometimes when things don't go my way, I get depressed or excited"
and I wish I could calm down and just realize that I should count my blessings
"and look at the bright side of everything, no matter how bad things get to the bright side that is my goal"
"It was very difficult, but I'm working on it and it seems to be a little easier"
When I took care of my mother and she died of c_o_p_d and then it became lung cancer.
I decided not to tell her that her condition had deteriorated so she wouldn't be afraid
"and I had to sit because I knew her symptoms were getting worse, but I couldn't tell her the truth."
And I made her think that everything was fine
It was
uh
my mother sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and I saw her health decline
that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if I could erase that if that never happened I would feel better
"Oh, I don't know I'm trying uh"
Be thankful that I am alive and try to focus on my own goals
and do not dwell on the negative things of my memory
my girlfriend is a very good positive <po> positive influence she wants me to be a better person
"Ever since I met her, she's been trying not to make me angry."
"not to feel negative and to be a nourishing positive zen-like person,"
"What she wants is something that makes me better, so I have to surrender."
It's very simple
I sleep well
"Sometimes I wake up when I have nightmares about my mother or something, but I go back to sleep."
"It's unknown, I don't know."
It just happens
I feel good.
"anyway that's my reality, I've been hit with a lot of financial"
Uh problems but I handle <ha> dealing with them well actually
"I looked at it like my girlfriend told me I had to do this, so it's at the top of my mind now"
no
no
today
when I woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and I had a lot of goals to achieve and I'm each one by one to reach
it gives me a feeling of performance and happiness
"my ideal weekend would play music with my girlfriend, because that's something we like to do"
healthy <hea> go to a nice dinner with healthy food and maybe exercise and feel good with my body and mind and mind
uh
likely
as a strong-willed person with a big heart
but has a short fuse and
Maybe complains too much about his own life
I wish I couldn't complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side
"Well, once I had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings I did he thought was terrible and then I felt it was the best I had ever done"
so that and I wouldn't understand how someone could feel like this
and I didn't know if it was out of jealousy or it was an honest opinion <opi> review so that I felt bad about it
as it is my goal
nothing I regret
I felt
Ten or twenty years ago
I don't know.
To <sigh>
"good everything I do, I enjoy it is hard to choose an exact event that I really enjoyed"
I don't know.
How to put one over the other
when things don't go my way and finance xxx come and I don't get jobs I'm qualified for but I feel I won't get
My fair chance
on occasion
It's very frustrating
I don't really feel guilty about things
"sometimes maybe when I'm angry and I shouldn't be, I feel guilty about never wanting to be"
Short with my girlfriend ever
She wouldn't deserve to use someone with vulgar language or screaming.
"or something like that, so I don't want to be around her like that, so I'm guilty"
my accomplishments of my skills through my music and my other skills that I have and my hard work has paid off and uh
I am very proud of this
"Okay, thanks."
Goodbye.
