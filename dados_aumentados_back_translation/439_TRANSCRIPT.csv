value
<sync>
Yes
I'm fine.
I am born of los engles and in los engles
Yes
They have many places to visit many people to see many things.
Smog
uh the environment has grown over the years uh xxx
I've been nineteen and fifty-two.
I was born here in los angeles and see such changes as far as environment with smog
and
mm basically it is the
I was in several places in the United States yes
uh try different kind of cuisine uh i like going to the museum like the historical i am a historical buff i
um
I'm going somewhere else than where I've been all my life.
Let me start with uh
I had never been to Boston before and when I left I could look at the historic uh the buildings and I went to uh
I saw it.
um
anyway the lake charles and the and the boats and so and it was just it was a good experience and around
There's another place where I went to a ferry and it and I got my mind emptied on it around
My God!
I can't imagine it right now.
"But unlike the new Orleans I was at the new Orleans, I didn't go to the mardi grass, it's just, I don't like to go and it uh to mardi grass if they have a lot"
"Guys, I was just in a low season."
I enjoyed this and I was on atlanta georgia
and I made a cruise
I went to the caribbeans and took the Mexico cruise.
uh i my next cruise I'd like to go is alaska because i'm able to see uh certain areas we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environment
I'm going out.
I have no problem eating alone.
I have no problem meeting people.
I'm just shy of talking to a stranger <Laughter>
"Oh I have a favorite thing uh I like to go on the Internet and I like it, competitions I'm a person who"
loves to try in a lot of competitions and I have been very successful since I was a child
I've won a lot of competitions and
Uh in the evening time uh I find like an hour of time and I just go online and just
"I'm so good at it that I know exactly the right time to even enter it. Normally I try to enter it before midnight when everyone else is asleep, so it was successful for me."
um
married and my children have <Laughter>
mm
"I have a 27-year-old son and I have a thirty-one-year-old son, both of them, uh, one of them is married, the other is not"
"and I became a grandmother not too long ago, so I have a grandson"
and uh my uh son he uh works for the county los engeles as a promotion < co> a property promotion promotion examiner
and the other is a computer engineer
"So, and I've been married for thirty-three years"
and
Basically Uh Marriage Pretty Strong
You know what
when you build a foundation with your children
and have a good relationship with them
and talk to them and find out what's going on.
"And tell them you love them, uh, son, I taught them all the time when they left the door, I love you."
"And even today, when they call me and hang up, they say, Mom, I love you."
You always have to make them feel good when they leave the door.
That you'll take care of me
and I've never had to go to any prison to get her out
"I mean, boys will be boys, but I never had a problem."
as far as they are in any serious trouble
"and I'm very proud that especially with boys I don't know how it might have been a little different with a girl, but <Laughter> with boys I have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law"
Uh the best thing is to see them grow and themselves become parents and see what they basically learn from you
and I watched my son as I said I was just a recent grandmother watching him deal with his son.
and it seems that he has learned a lot from his foundation that he has learned at home.
"about dealing with his son to be responsible to go to work every day, and he knows that hey"
"I have a wife, I have a son, and it's my job to make sure I keep a roof over her heads."
so it pays off
And I basically he treats her well
around my mother was tougher on me <Laughter> uh my parents around
"for some unknown reason I think because I'm my sister and I are the girls they were not strict on the boys, but they were tougher on the girls"
"so they didn't let us go to many places and then my parents weren't type, who like to travel"
"and I used to look at them and said no I won't be like them I'll travel I won't just stay home I mean, I mean, I mean, there's nothing wrong with them because they"
"Love found at home <Laughter> and did things at home, but she never really traveled anywhere and my mother used her fear of airplanes for a"
"and I tried to get her on a plane and go somewhere and she said, oh I'm going here, I'm going there, but she never died, that she never did to make a trip"
So I made it up to her.
and uh I want to do something different and that's more to travel than and more to be out there
"I was more of a social butterfly, my mother wasn't a social butterfly."
So I made it up to you.
I think before I speak
and then I'm the kind of person also around
I accept other people's feelings before I...
cover up the wrong thing I'm trying to
Uh analyze the situation first
before <bef> because sometimes you can open your <yo> mouth too soon and you can stick yourself into something you might not be able to get out of
um
"It's probably something about my husband that he did, oh he, I know what it was, it's about, uh, good probably about some new construction that my husband is working on at our house."
We had a disagreement about that.
Men have their own kind of things to do and to
I had told him not to have a certain uh
eh person to work at our house
"but because of the personal relationship he has with that person, he went on"
And now he sees all the falls
"And he didn't listen, and I didn't say I told you."
but I guess he can see by my facial expression
I told him I said you were losing money.
"And it became one problem at a time, so now all the building is in the air because he knows he's done wrong."
"and uh but he doesn't want the fact that he knows well, but he doesn't really want the fact, so he says look it's my project no it's our project"
This is one of the biggest arguments we have now.
that I can imagine that this is new
I felt that he didn't really listen to me.
and he looked more like that uh a cheaper economic way that he can do that without going through the right ways because I told him that to
You need to do your research
I'm the kind of person I do my research before I jump into something I'm trying to do my I's and cross my T's
But my husband he's not so he likes oh I can do this person this project for x amount of money
"And he's a good friend of mine, so I don't care that he's licensed."
"he doesn't look at all the stuff he is, he just jumps in <Laughter>"
what cost him some extra money unnecessary money he spent when and then I mean it was a lot of money
and so I was really very upset yesterday and I was very upset about it because
It was just wasted money that we could have saved because in the end we're all doing the same thing again
and it didn't make sense
um
I'm retired early.
To I was very happy at the age of fifty I retired two thousand and two I worked for the state of California
"To be an invalid analyst and what happened, I was able to get the reason why I could retire so early because I had worked since I was eighteen"
and I had as thirty and a half years of service
and what was so nice about it that only took <n> to get West in as ten years in my health insurance
"So I was able to get full health insurance, but the only thing about it when you retired was I was with Calpirg and I don't know if you're familiar with Calpirg, but"
We have an excellent pension system and since I have worked with them for so long
um
"I didn't get the full percentage I should have stayed until I was fifty-five, but I got out at fifty and I didn't get the full amount, but that's okay."
I found myself doing a small part-time job.
because of the economic reason and then I have wounditis <laughter> so around
"I think that was the kind of mistake I should have waited until I was fifty-five, but I see it now as far as the health insurance that I really benefited because the rising cost of health insurance has increased"
and I don't pay very little money
So I think about uh negates the uh uh uh uh the money I get
um
Let me see the most difficult thing
It's probably when my mother died because I'm not used to someone dying.
and my mother around
Died in ninety-nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma
and
"I'm packing her funeral around my brother and sister, we'd never see anyone in the face who dies."
or put together a funeral and all responsibility <responsi> because I am the oldest it was placed in me
and I'm like oh my God what do I xxx
and so around me was kind of like left out there trying to find her insurance policy because I had asked her to make sure she'd fix everything.
"and she never came to her, so the hardest thing was to go through her house and try to get all that stuff together and find things."
"You know, I keep my things organized myself, but... for some unknown reason, she didn't organize hers and..."
I think that was the hardest thing and knowing how much I had to pay because I had to come out of my pocket on some of my things
and unfortunately my mother <Laughter> this is interesting
"She had a little barrel insurance, but she had a million dollars accident insurance, and of course she didn't die with an accident she had."
"a medical condition, so that was something, so we had to pay for everything"
"Yeah, it was, but..."
"and now I can with i i around < laughter> that will sound strange, but to"
"since I learned from it, so I made it available for my children"
That my husband and I met
and we always land our insurance uh uh uh police xxx not insurance policy but um
What do you call that?
Barrel insurance we had that
"and it just we have it for mm many many years, so it's almost paid, but xxx ten years it will pay for everything around the plot and everything"
and uh another thing I did I even wrote my own obituary I know that sounds strange
so
my son
I don't want them to go through anything.
I went through it.
And my husband agreed that we agreed on one thing.
and
he said he doesn't want anyone having any problems uh people coming and telling them what to do it's already written we have a living trust
"I mean, it's nothing they can do but make a call."
And that's it.
I have no problem sleeping I sleep very well <Laughter>
pretty good
um
"I was a little tired, but this is just because of the physical condition around I have found I have vitamin B deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency, so it is more physical, but not in the mental"
um
Exercise walking more so
"No, not really."
no
no
"I'm basically happy all the time I'm mm more, so I make other people happy I get more phone calls from people want inspiration about things uh"
when they have projects they work on and I try to encourage them
"Uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know, hey I really appreciate your input around"
Thank you and then I'll track them and see how they're doing.
oh uh resource person I was around
described as a resource person from my superior
to my friends because I'm the kind of person I'm researching everything I'm getting into.
"I just don't dive xxx into any situation, I'm trying to search for information uh"
some I know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the Internet but also back to the old school as well as find this place
"I mean, I've googled the card but also I love the thomas brother I'll never give up my thomas brothers card"
"yellow pages would be surprised, I don't give up my yellow pages, so there are certain little things I don't really let go, I know we have technology, but"
Sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can find a lot of things.
"that although technology exists <gi> you have it right on your finger, but you can find things"
and they say I'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to look for things
And I get this because I like to look for things and find it
And that gives me satisfaction
uh
I wish I could...
"Stop, stop and stop my weight <Laughter> I will lose weight, I will go on this great diet before the summer and"
and then until Christmas I am one that they call a jo-yo weight problem
and when I can stop bingling and make food my friend
um
I think this is just a nervous disorder that I just like to eat and to
but also I don't like being overweight because I have a lot of beautiful clothes at home
and I can't do it on xxx now so
"I know I say when I go to this binge and try to lose weight for summer time, so I get into these some beautiful clothes, so it's mm mostly uh"
"not happy with my weight, that's it"
I'm sorry I didn't hear you.
um
"No, not really I regret <Laughter> that I can't stay skinny <Laughter> I can't lose I mean I can lose weight, but I can't regret it to keep it I fall back on putting the weight back on"
um
let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago
mm
I would have saved a little more money before I retired. <Laughter> and uh xxx uh basically around
Put more money away before I retire
instead of retiring too early
the proudest of my life
um
Meeting with many people who came in my life
Uh I have good friends I still have fifteen of the best friends I went to primary school
"and in very rare you could find someone can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends that we were in a sorority together, went together to college"
lived in the same neighborhood and fact that we just had to good all of us had our sixty years of birthday and our high school
Group we together a 60-year birthday meeting
"and here all fifteen of us with the exception of one that we all live and are healthy and we stay in touch, so I think uh"
It basically holds the same friends I think anyway we'll probably survive each other <Laughter>
All right.
You're welcome.
See you.
