value
Yes
I feel really good because I...
I've been sleeping
"all day yesterday almost and I usually do something when it's not work, it's school when it's not school"
"It's work and then social life and all that, so I actually didn't have work yesterday and I don't have a school"
I only have school on the weekdays
so I actually slept probably like
"Eighty five percent of the day, so I really feel good"
"but I'm actually kind of tired and I've got other things going on, but different from that I'm good today"
I'm originally from Bakersfield.
california
really
I moved to l_a when I was a child and then
I left here when I was about three or four.
"and I was moved, I moved back here"
in oh seven and I have lived here
Since
um
wow since I've been here since oh seven I'm just back maybe <clears thoat>
Maybe how
a few times <ti> well I went there for like a summer
As in oh
"Eight, I think I've been there almost all summer, but I've only been back a few times since I got back."
"Unfortunately,"
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
Uh it's similar to l_a
It's not really comparable to l_a i I grew up in sacramento actually I didn't get to tell you I was born in Bakersfield then I lived here and then i
"Anyway, I don't know if I forgot anyway, yes, there's nothing really to do, it's really small, it's the valley around"
I have everything to do.
Oceans and it is located by all kinds of around
through many cool places like vegas and uh
san diego and what have you not so <s>
"but yes, otherwise I miss my friends and stuff, but I don't miss"
like the actual city
I just miss some of the people who
I grew up with
"Oh, I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel much, actually I was just out"
california like six times
I'd love to travel
once I uh
have enough money to do this
um
I originally wanted to be a filmmaker
and that I still want to be a filmmaker and I want to
Studying <stu> I was
I took the communication and uh
have also general ed things and around
took classes like video production and around <tisk>
has done a lot uh in terms of to films
"and I've learned a lot of things and I still have that knowledge, but I haven't really used it since I've been back"
here in l_a I did all this in Northern California in Sacramento
but around and then I switched <trans> to be
"Um to the business I took some courses in that, but now I'm actually studying to be an optician and I'm actually almost done"
with schooling and always ready to try to get into the field and
become an optician so
"But I still want to be a filmmaker, and that's still one of my plans."
and I still have to actually play in to poker
a few years ago and I really like
the idea of becoming
"a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player, but both of these jobs are"
extremely hard to earn out and you
must be like the small percent so that we can see if then
hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere
to be an optician
"Oh, uh,"
"I guess I was just trying to find something that it was like it was like a trade, it's good, it's a private college, but"
it just as specific
Trains you in...
a field and you just learn that you don't like your g_e and
all these other classes as you would normally do for how to
"like one around a major or whatever you're going to do, so it trains you specifically to be an optician and jump into the field"
I took it just because I really want to be a dentist assistant and since <si>
It sounds like something I might be able to do.
"It sounds interesting, but then the consultant actually"
"to get my attention on an optician, so"
I'm trying to be an optician now
and it's so interesting
"It's fun, it's..."
"really hard, but it's interesting and it"
and it's
and it's fun it's got to be rewarding
um
Benefits to the extent that it is worthwhile to be able to help people to see
better and feel comfortable with
"Glasses or contact lenses, whatever they feel"
more comfortable with
Cool
"I'm definitely leaving, but I can be shy"
sometimes like I'm a little shy right now because
They're talking to you and you're in a computer and you're a cartoon
or uh animated or whatever <Laughter>
so
Cool
but none normally ninety eight percent
"To me actually, what it's actually kind of funny and I think maybe"
This could go for some of the poker players to
"I've never really spoken to a professional poker player, but as far as I want"
"Uh, actually..."
Playing Poker Is About
actually something that
"helps me forget everything, as far as e.g."
Things in the past or present
Um or future things that come uh as far as I'm really relaxed <rela>
I just couldn't think about anything and just think about poker and it's actually kind of like a therapy
"for me, because I don't like it, I guess you could say it's some kind of drug because I don't think about anything as far as stressed or depressed or things that have happened in the past"
"I focus on poker, so it's actually kind of exhilarating"
"Playing poker is also very stressful, so I guess it's kind of like"
"Catch twenty-two or whatever, but uh"
Yeah so no poker I play like basketball
I like watching movies I like going to the beach actually
One of the things I like to do is go to the beach because it does
I feel good.
But I didn't leave.
I usually just go to the beach when it's hot not during the
Cold season
"So it's coming soon, so I'm looking forward to being busy, but uh, I'll try to go to the beach as much as I can <Laughter>"
"I'm really good at controlling my temperament, actually I've just been in like"
"I'm thirty years old, I've been in six fights, maybe and"
All six were launched by the other person.
"So I've never started a real fight in my whole life when I was a little kid, but"
"to talk about real things, like when you put it on a"
thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no I'm good like every once in a while when there was
"a few times maybe in the past, where like i"
was not able to control it
but as far as ever to be violent or anything that never happened and never would
But for...
most of the time yeah I didn't like
People do stupid things all the time and I just like to leave it especially like
"on the highway and stuff, but uh"
oh well I mean I argued a little bit with my ex-girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really
"Little things, I guess maybe we're just"
"I think we were good for each other, but maybe another life because uh"
We just knocked our heads too much.
"Obviously, she's probably my ex-girlfriend for a reason like this."
about which we have only quarreled
Girlfriend friend things
uh
um
I guess my film production <filmm> to
Other treatment
"There are a lot of things I could have handled differently, but uh"
Uh maybe when I was really good when I was younger and
I worked for
Scrubbed_entry
Production assistant for filmmakers around
"Where I lived in Sacramento, so I did everything I wanted to do about my dreams"
and had a lot of my stuff together I had my own car my own apartment
And then I got involved with the wrong guy.
Group of people I appreciate and
somehow downhill from there and how lost everything like car job apartment
So I just wish maybe I'd never go with
"this kind of people, this kind of girls"
"Um, um..."
per and per
"Uh, because I'd clean my throat"
probably my life would probably be a lot different now but I think everything happens for a reason
and obviously I think you should also like when things happen good or bad uh
"<sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again, you..."
do not make this mistake or try it not so bad I think so
you know
mm
"Hardest decision, I guess"
"I guess, uh, toughest decision"
the hardest decision I've ever had to make
would be...
I guess you could say I don't really know.
wanted to say that uh
"Maybe like my ex-girlfriend, like I could've liked"
stayed with her and I really like still in love with her and uh
would love to be with her and miss her
but I guess the biggest mistake I had to make was how
I know it wasn't like a healthy relationship and
I know if we liked to stay together or if we married or had children who
I don't think it would work in the end anyway
I guess the decision that would be my hardest decision
To really stay away from her and not come back with her
and uh
Don't be like that with her
I guess that was a tough really hard decision because...
"I could have done it easy, and I guess maybe it would have been me."
"in this way happier, but stressed and"
in order to be irritable or whatever and have to deal with the other way with it I guess with each other our relationship so
It was really hard is still so uh I think that's it
do not choose to be with someone I loved and loved
or whatever it is
Cool
"Oh, what was that?"
I beg your pardon.
nevad
I do not understand the first part of this question.
Oh an event
Oh an event okay around that I could delete
Uh event I could get out of my memory
"My ex-girlfriend, I wish I'd never met her."
"My first girlfriend and my last girlfriend, I wish I'd never met her because we were"
we were in love together for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard
so
I guess both of them
"Oh, it's extremely easy that I could fall asleep"
"somewhere I actually broke a record I almost fell asleep standing, that would have been strange because I think I would have"
I don't know that I just got caught.
"I think I was really <r> I mean I was really tired, but I do a lot of things so it's hard for me not really get so much sleep"
"as much as I want to like <l>, but I could sleep when I'm dead or whatever."
as they say
<tisk> uh no
no
"lately I'm just tired, but I'm fine I guess"
"I'm dealing with this separation, but it's only a month a week."
But it's actually not I mean I've happened worse things I'm going to happen worse things
had worse things happen so yeah
I guess...
"Well, I'm a religious person, I'm Catholic I believe in God I know that there is a God so around I obviously even dedicated everything from him"
"People to God, no matter what they are, sometimes they lose faith, so sometimes I lose faith, but it doesn't take that long and I know there's a God I know."
"that I'm gonna be okay and that everything's gonna be okay, but you know, it's hard to deal with, I don't really know, I just keep going you know, go to school and work"
"and I just have to keep going, I can't give up, so I can just"
try to stay busy and
Staying busy helps somehow and how to sleep
"a lot helps, but I can't sleep much so"
I don't know.
Uh play poker
Play basketball
Deals helps me deal with it and how uh
Hanging out with my friends sometimes helps me
why
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
I felt really happy on Friday because...
I went to San Diego for the first time.
"It wasn't as cool as I thought, but we were like under certain circumstances, as far as my boyfriend had business to worry about and it took a long time so"
"I would have preferred to be free during this time but I wasn't, but we had fun and it was cool uh I enjoyed it so yeah I really liked uh I had fun and I was"
happy to go to San Diego for the first time and I want to
had a good time
oh
She's
To <Laughter>
"a lot of things, but I think I'd say how"
Be nicer to like
Family members You know a couple of family members I wish I had been
other than:
"acted differently than not that I was like a terrible, but I would have nicer in some cases that if I didn't know the situation at hand uh"
I never really wanted to go around and celebrate all the time as I did
like high school and various part-times from outside high school I would have only
really focused on re-training and so and then
"The party would not have gotten any relationships later, so I would have basically told myself to be more."
"Uh have more direction to be focused, I guess uh"
"Stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people I don't appreciate that I'm the healthiest but < sniffle> around yeah I just would have done a lot of things differently, but"
"I don't know if I said that before, but I think it's all happening for a reason."
um
So I guess it all happened.
now for a reason
So I'm just gonna keep going.
uh
"<tisk> I guess they would have the few I have, or few I had because I have best friends now a few I think a new"
"and I've lost a few best friends as far as we just don't like going our own ways, but I guess they'd probably all describe me more than how"
to happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy
Umm aloud uh
Don't be silly.
Uh intelligent
and uh
I just think in uh in general just like
entertaining to be around
have
"I wasn't always the best best best friend, but I'm trying to tell you my toughest"
So that's how it's like
Cool
To <sigh>
change me uh
I wish I'd been around
<xxx> I wish I was 15 pounds lighter
um
I wish I didn't have to.
uh
How can I say put this uh I feel like
um
I feel like I'm I feel like I'm
I must be like in a relationship with a girl
I feel like I wish I didn't have to be
as if I felt like
that I had to have a girl all the time
and so I could help me focus on how more
and I wish I didn't need it
Sexually around
I didn't always think about sex thing to girls all the time as far as
I have to be in a sex
with them like
As far as sex wants to do as much as I do because I feel like
if I have not concentrated or have to
how to be with girls or like in a relationship
"Well, who I don't know how to say it, but I'm just saying how I exist like guy friends I know"
"I don't need as much sex as I do and I feel like I need more than I sometimes feel like I wish I didn't need it that much, so I think I'm a little addicted to it."
where I could focus on more things than just
"I mean, I don't just focus on sex, but I feel like I'm focusing on it if I don't need it or think I need it so much that I could do more things in my life."
but
"Yeah, so I'm trying to work on it."
<low breath> <sigh> what I am most proud of
uh
I'm very proud of
<makes sounds with the mouth>
I'm very proud <prou> oh I guess I'm very proud to work for TV stations back in Sacramento and on a lot of around
"Movie sets, because like me"
I was sixteen and I decided I wanted to be a fimmaker and then
"two years later, a year and a half later, I started taking steps to become a filmmaker and then I worked."
Work in the economy and as a filmmaker for a real
Really...
Really...
"good to cinematograph a really good to freelance cinematograph, which is based on living in sacramento they have a lot of things, so I'm proud to have had a dream and I went for them and I and actually end up doing things to my dream, which in my dream so"
"Yeah, I guess that's one of my greatest accomplishments, like"
over ten years ago but I hope I know
Something like that could happen again soon or you know it like this
Perfect
Goodbye.
