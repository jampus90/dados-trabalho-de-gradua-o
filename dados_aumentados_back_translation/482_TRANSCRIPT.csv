value
<sync>
Yes
I'm fine.
I was born in texas and I moved to California when I was three and grew up here in California yeah
I was
I've never been there.
um
I don't have any relatives there.
I have no reason to go back there.
um
<makes sounds with mouth>
"Well, my family's here."
"this is one, uh, the weather is great"
Uh the beaches and mountains are here
all these things are very good
"Uh, transport"
that's probably <probab> probably say most people
um
It's expensive to live here.
that's probably the first two
Recently I've traveled
um
you get to see new places and new people
Learn more about other cultures
and uh different ways people think
oh uh at the end of the march I went to ecuador for a week
uh
I spent most of the time one day with
"with an ecuadorian who speaks only Spanish and I speak very little Spanish, so we have"
"It was a challenge for me to communicate with him, I felt like a little child."
try to:
"You know you know what that is, what it is."
It was very humiliating.
um
"You know, just see that"
"You know if you don't, if you're not able to communicate then that this can be very difficult"
I'm probably more of a shy person.
Genetics I don't know why
"I'm an electrician, so I studied electrical engineering."
I also studied uh computer networking
um
It was
I guess...
just uh kind of circumstances
I needed
the
the work I did was not to care for the family
and
I knew someone who could get me a job at the electrical work and so I tracked it because of the financial gain
mm
It gave me a lot of opportunity.
But I don't think that's what I want to do for the rest of my life.
I'm going to be a missionary.
Uh my wife and I are looking at the move to ecuador in autumn
uh for four years
and last year we trained in North Carolina
for one year
And that was like theology and bible training
um
Essentially Putting God
a um
a desire in my heart to go beyond
To get beyond myself and do something for other people
to go and
and learn about other people their culture
and to share the Gospel with them
good in my immediate family
um
"I'm married, I've been married for ten years, this June, and we have four daughters."
and then
but I have an older brother
No sisters
um
What do you want to know about my family?
um
I'm really close to my wife and daughters
I'm not very close to my brother because he's mentally handicapped.
He has the mental capacity of a seven-year-old.
Although he's five years older than me
"So just because of this dynamic, it's hard to have a close relationship with him."
but I'm pretty close to my parents my brother lives with my parents
um
I'd say my
my youth pastor in high school
he was a really positive influence in me
um
only he has a
he has a drive and a zeal for
for the persecution of the truth
um
and just...
"study of the Bible, and"
and because of its influence this kind of
To want to study the Bible
I think I've gotten better at it.
there were
Times in which
You know I'm getting angry.
and uh
You know it can only
somehow really reign over me only the frustration
and I'm the kind of person that needs me
Usually it takes some time until I get angry and some time to
to calm down again
But I did
I've learned...
"Over time, the really angry"
And keeping that anger within yourself doesn't do it.
It doesn't.
"attack the other person or the thing that I'm angry at, just somehow attacks me"
and so it's really not a it's not a good behavior to
to keep it that way
"If things piss me off, I'll try"
uh
how to talk to the other person tell you know that this situation makes me angry I try to talk through them somehow
and to resolve it and come to a resolution
"To compromise even more than just, but try to really solve the root of the problem"
To <sigh>
"Well, a"
a few weeks ago or maybe it was even a month ago
um
my wife and I were on a trip with her parents
and her parents had already left
We just drove down.
orange land area for this trip
and
"My wife wanted her to expect certain things to be done before the trip, or that certain things be packaged."
and
but had not really
"In my eyes, she hadn't made that clear, but in her eyes she had"
And so
when I tried to meet these expectations
they
um
You know I didn't get her after what she wanted and she got angry and so from my perspective I did what she wanted
And somehow being attacked for it.
so
Then I started yelling at her.
and
"And we know that we had this conflict, but then..."
you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had somehow talked by
and we had found out what was the cause of this conflict
um
ask the moment during the conflict
uh
very you know only mm very angry you know that you can feel it
In the body
um
Part I
"which I guess, the"
"Anger was probably the secondary answer, but my initial answer was that I felt that the feeling was attacked and that came out as anger"
so
I'd think...
yeah so at first I felt attacked and then that led to anger
mm hmm hmm hmm
I guess it was...
decide to go
To go to our training last year
I felt that God had put my heart on me.
that this was something I was supposed to pursue
My wife didn't feel that way
and
i
I just felt very strong that this was something we should pursue
and
but at the same time I knew that if my wife did not support it it would somehow fall apart
so
I kind of gave it up <r> gave it up
"Um, and I and I said to her, you know I'm not gonna force you..."
"You know, if you want to go, then we're going, but if not, then we're going to do something else, we're going to look at something else and we're not going."
That was difficult for me because...
Do you remember that kind of felt like a loss because I felt deeply that I should do what I should do?
um
"But then, after I kind of gave it up"
then
um
"then she came to a point where she said no I have a peace about doing this, and then we went ahead and persecuted it so"
"So it was kind of difficult for me to give it up, was <wa>"
tell me about something bad or something I can erase from my memory
um
Oh let me see
I'm not sure.
"I don't know, I can't really"
think of something very traumatic
"I'd want to delete it, but I think"
They know good things and positive things and bad things they all somehowa
shape who we are
and
So I can't think of anything I want to delete
Usually
It's not usually that bad.
um
are you referring to the questionnaire where I said that I had problems < trou> some sleep disorders
um
the work that I work the
the
"The way the planning has shifted, so that i"
So lately I've been working some night shifts
or cemetery layers
so
um
Come home in the morning
"You know, when it's bright, it was hard for me to sleep."
But it was mostly because I stayed up so late because of work.
"Uh, it's pretty simple."
um
"if I don't sleep, then I'm gonna get crooked"
uh
I've been feeling good lately
"No, not really."
no
no
um
hmm
I don't know.
I can't think of anything that
The way of the ordinary
but
um
yesterday
we took my wife and I
took our three < th> our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest
to stay with her grandmother
But we took her to the park and they played.
and
"Yes, so those are always happy times when we bring the children to the park"
um
I think he'd say I'm a
a family father
That...
I'm sure he can count on me.
Usually my friend I'm doing at the end
um
various work around the house for him
Because I'm a craftsman.
So this way I think he'd say I'm kind of reliable or someone he could go to to advice
um
I guess I'd...
I guess I'd like to be able to
um
Start conversations with people
Simpler
sometimes
I'm in trouble.
I'm just talking to people.
"especially if they're in a group, if people are one on one, then it's usually easier for me to talk to them."
but somehow talking to people in a group
I wish I was a little better at it
"Now, if there is"
All right.
"what I wanted to say before that was,"
"When I give a speech to a large group, I don't really have a problem with it, but if it's more interaction, it's kind of difficult."
uh
Advice I would have given myself ten or twenty years ago
um
Probably it would have been to go to college immediately instead of going to school later in life.
um
That's it.
I thought that made the biggest difference.
in my life I think
um
"Well, I have four children and"
I hope I raise them right I hope that
That...
"You know the mistakes I made, I can somehow lead them"
through their journey in life and I hope that they
at the end a little
better for them than
when I
um
"Yeah, I just hope"
Hope somehow through them
that I can
you know
leave <lea> something rewarding
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
