My brother and I were arguing about rents.
"Yes, it does."
it is very good very strong
"Yeah, that's good."

I can't say I don't feel guilty often.
I don't really have something I want to erase from my memory
What drives me crazy
Ignorance of Racism
Things that like it
I wish I had behaved differently.
um
I don't really want to discuss it.
"Well, I'm kind of in the middle of it, now I don't know if I want to move to New York."
