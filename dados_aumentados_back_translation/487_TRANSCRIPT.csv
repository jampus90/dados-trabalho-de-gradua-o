"I moved to Ia in two thousand and seven, but my family came here."
many years ago more than forty years ago
I'm not going back to detroit.
I really don't like the weather and I have no reason for most of my immediate family is out here
in California and
Uh totally different around
for me was detroit just very cold it wasn't
the best for my personality I prefer l_a more space
a warmer climate warmer people
only one other
different Uh-Vibe
that I like better
"after my husband and I ended relationship, I had family out here, so I thought it would be easier"
"to start here from the beginning, as some of the other places I had lived"
or stay where we were at
extremely easy I came to visit here every year while I was in college so I was extremely used to it
plus I had also
taken out of school by six months and lived out here
"and went to school out here, so I was totally used to it"
"Well, like I said, the weather is number one it's just uh"
less crowded it is more free space it is a
a quieter friendly atmosphere
less hurry
The smog would be one.
and when I drive the traffic
"In certain areas it may be, but"
um
in general
"There's not much I don't like < l> it's, as I think, the general threat to the earthquake, but that's"
is not really such a factor because it rarely happens
the price of real estate <Laughter> that's another one I don't necessarily like
I can't see your shoes I can't see your shoes at all
so
I don't travel as much as I used to.
but I've travelled all over the world
new experiences
"Well, I used to be an international flight attendant and then I traveled later"
through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so
I have visited many different places and
I have to say it was them.
all quite a lot of fun because you know there are different cultures to learn to see different things
Enjoying Experience
my experiences I would say in order
I visited Europe more than that I also visited
Uh in South South America I guess because the cultures are so very different
I would probably say rather shy around in general
in comparison to people I know are really very outgoing
but also
I let them describe me as starting
I like to read I like to walk or go electricity or walk
Listening to music you know
I'm very good at controlling my temperament
oh
Probably when I was
married to my husband many years ago
"there could be many things I don't even know in specific, but just everything in general quite a lot could get into a debate slash argument with him"
It could be a choice.
uh
some of the cases if I could have been with him and I
"you know it got emotional, or"
"let me bother him that he's such a big deal of something, instead of"
um
You know you saw it.
"not reacting something, maybe, but it would always be, we were also urged to respond like this"
"You know you can't always say that you can ignore a person there, because it's often just about ignoring the situation and it doesn't escalate."
but some people
You know you're not responding to the so-called norm.
if you ignore it
"They'll only know they're escalating, but that's not always the case."
I taught middle school children and you can try to rest
"to use methods with them, but that doesn't always work, but you always have to take care of how the teacher"
You know your professional behavior so that you don't really
Even if they know that the children do something outrageous or potentially dangerous for themselves or other children.
"Well, that could be"
several
mm
I guess it's a decision in...
together with my mother decide to let a relative have surgery
uh
"that you know that the result was uncertain, it could go either way"
and in this case she died so
you know
"It's a pretty tough decision because you don't know, but you also know if it couldn't be very serious."
Results also for them
mhm
"Oh many different things that could happen, you know in life that you are always second guess"
"Things you might be able to do, but"
"They can also be learning experiences, so it is necessarily a good thing,"
Delete them you know if
"They can see it as positive, sometimes people can have a"
strong reaction and they don't really stop by
uh Impact of the event
Because there could be something that
you can choose from that
But there I grew up in a house of
Dysfunction so there was
Just domestic abuse you know and...
"There have been many cases, so you can't just say one thing because there are many traumatic things."
But it would also have been a different outcome if one had learned to deal with some things.
"who appear as adults in life,"
sometimes I see among acquaintances or friends who
had not really strong experiences
"fall apart or just have very difficult times to deal with,"
"You can listen that you know that you and I, because I understand that not everyone has the same experience you know."
Go through them
Levels of
"understanding and you know,"
how you know someone
They have a balance of background information on
which will help them undress and see that you know that things will
Progress in a better way know that this is not like
the end of the world or as terrible as it seems it could be
and you can also tell other experiences with them
"of things that were worse, or"
"You know, seem to be"
and of course there is always in general I mean
when you look at all the misfortunes of the world
You know that most of these things don't affect
we or the people we know here
", so that"
"ü perspective, which"
You know that you're someone from her
"I won't necessarily say self-absorption, but the apparently"
Intensity of her experience at the moment
Now we have a good relationship with her
anyway in most cases there are different levels of
"To stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced, so it has"
made them interact with life and people you know more than others
some have not been having
so much
Experience in life that helps them to deal with things you know in a different way
so it keeps evolving
and i
go into positivity as a trace of
You know how I react to trying to testify.

very strong reactions or reactions or interactions that they may have
Excuse me.
I didn't hear you repeat it.

Situations sometimes much more difficult you know how to deal with things so
"Most of the time, it's important that you know it pretty well."
"It depends on whether I'm dealing with a lot of things or study, or"
You know.
"I'm trying to get more hours a day because I have to do things, then you know it's less, but"
um
in general I have no problem sleeping
It's only if I let myself stay awake because there are more things I want to do
I have the feeling that okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it generally goes because I have several projects that I work on so
But generally good
For example:
"I mean,"
Not particularly
"I mean, I just seem"
um
less stressful as I get more things done I just get and the stress comes from sometimes there are a lot more things to do

Things different when I was younger than spending my money differently or

You know you could have done some things differently.
