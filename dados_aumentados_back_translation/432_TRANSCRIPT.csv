value
<sync>
I'm fine.
Beautiful
New York
yep
about six months
Six months ago
nicer pace
Photo work
That's a good move.
mm
I love the weather
cool people
Relax easy to talk
uh
beautiful surroundings
mm
Crimes if you go through some sections
"Yeah, that's good."
I've done my share
uh the ability to <sigh>
Record events
a part of being a part of exciting things like
um
Olympic Games Festivals uh
Special Show
"Yeah, that's good."
Get to know new people
"Yeah, that's good."
which
mm-Canada
It was nice.
uh very refreshing mm clean environment
People seemed very lighthearted.
but you are able to do serious work
I love the landscape
I think it was aboard an Amtrak train.
"Yeah, that's good."
Uh exempt
Photography
"I think I'm doing it, you know?"
I really have <re>
I really think I'm doing it
not very difficult you don't know uh uh at least not for me because I think I have a natural inclination for it
Uh and around I connect well with people
"I'm more shy, but I'm forced to leave because I know you can't really do anything, to be shy"
"But if I had a choice, I'd rather"
You know.
a little more withdrawn <Laughter>
Until I know I feel like I'm just going the next safe way.
so that somehow circumcised with my spirit of adventure sometimes I think
an example
"well an example of what exactly you mean, which aspect"
All right.
good example like uh travel
Sometimes you want to go to a certain place
and it's uh
Something big is happening there
"Even though it's a great place, but it's not such a cool place to take as for example as Boston I went there a lot"
um
Now you know that everyone I'm talking to is a little nervous if they should go there <Laughter> You know you know it.
xxx know you have a great time you know I think it's because of all the interference that just happened somehow you know throws you out of the track a little make you rethink
um
is this a good place to escape at the moment
something like that you know
mhm
mm
"Uh, I got it."
I'm going for a walk
I'm calling a friend we're drinking tea or something.
I think I got this under control.
mm eh
uh
it was probably something stupid in a work situation that took about five minutes and oh pretty much didn't fight again
I'm not really staying.
negative things too much
uh
I don't regret it now.
I can't think of anything.
the hardest decision I've ever had to make
was uh
Do not hire a good friend
for a job that
You know they weren't qualified.
That's hard.
"Because you have to tell them it's not the friendship you hire, it's their competence."
My father
"Uh, he's just..."
taught me how to
"You know, uh overwhelmed"
uh trouble when I grew up and how important it was not to give up
uh
and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it disappears you know if you keep there long enough
"and I found that to be true, so"
mhm
um
it's okay except for <exce> except for some of my uh
my
"distant siblings, you know, I don't see as often as I can"
- Yeah.
"You only know that if you travel a bit, you don't see people because they're not always there you know."
It's nothing like Mhm yeah
mhm
uh
"Well, you know, I'm I'm pretty excited when I'm working on something or developing something like that"
"I tend to overlook the time at some point, but unlike the"
"You know, when I get out, that's all."
All right.
I think I'm going to be a little uh
uh try and figure out how I'm going to sleep
"You know as soon as I can to make xxx, but to"
Uh I'm trying not to be uh grumpy or anything I'm just probably a little tired mm
I feel okay now.
uh
Changes like what
mm
"Well, I see a hopeful future you know and I see uh"
"I see a lot of new things unfolding, I mean from this perspective, yes"
no
Never
I feel okay now.
I went to a great party last week.
that was really cool
"Yeah, that's good."
"Well, it was like on a roof uh"
and a lot to really uh
nice people
which are basically in the same kind of uh
Mindset
Uh Pursuing the same kind of uh uh objectives
and it was actually very inspiring and I got a lot of information
and many good connections have been made
mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome
my ideal weekend
is uh
Cooking my own food relaxing
you know and
when I'm in the mood for company you know
I have friends and uh
"You know, uh family members come to me"
All right.
"I'd like to put more weight on it, but it doesn't seem to work."
I eat like crazy and nothing happens
mm
"Well, you know, I think people in general sometime uh"
uh misread <mis> misread you know if you like anyhow uh
if you look different or in <i> in a different kind of
when another set of things
make you uh excited or you're in a different way to think
People tend to misjudge you
"You know, and that really pissed me off someday."
"But, um, I'm I somehow figured it out and I'm pretty over you know, so I see it as their loss and don't mean you know if they didn't meet me"
You know that's hey
"Maybe they don't need it, and I don't really care that I've worked these things out somehow in the time you know."
"Yeah, that's good."
um my best qualities probably around
"Look, I think..."
< mumble>
and uh
Maybe just talk uh
"uh you know, on a talkative level"
uh
"Yeah, that's good."
"Sometimes people tend to burden me with everything they have, because of the"
But you know.
I guess that's probably one of the things that come with the lawn so
"when I smoke, when I see too much of it, I just pull back"
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
to go for your dream
Believe in what you do
Don't let anyone discourage you.
and you'll be fine
And that's how I feel now that it's evolved itself.
very proud of the
I think my...
mean my kind of spiritual relationship that you know and my my peace about
not too anxious
about <bout> things that can walk around me and see that you know that there are no mistakes that really happen
and you shouldn't really uh
I'm proud to be able to
arrived at this point
in my
my my thinking my frame
I think that saved me a lot of problems that might be different.
< mumbles>
very good questions
uh i
See you.
