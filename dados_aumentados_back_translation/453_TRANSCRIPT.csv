Meet old people <Laughter> I love talking to old people
um
good I work a lot with uh my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California
"And I spend a lot of time with the elders, and I speak to them, and they help me greatly"
So I hear good stories
mhm
mm
I go to the mountains and see waterfalls that no one else had seen except my people.
"Yeah, that was the most beautiful thing I found."
mm
Mhm <Laughter>
It depends on the situation if I'm dead when someone comes to me
"looking for me to help them, I take control"
"But if I need help, it's anyway I work at asking for help so"
it depends on the situation
mhm
i Garden
And I paint
I'm very good at it.
"Three days ago it was about communication, it was the lack of communication on the part of the other person."
and
I needed them to communicate better so I could understand
"They didn't communicate, so we fought."
and uh has cleared it up <Laughter>
I felt ignored.
because this is an individual with whom I spend almost every minute of my day not being told what was going on in the person's head and then creating a situation
"You know, I was kept away, I didn't like it."
uh
I'd rather have <Laughter>
mm
uh
Probably the lack of time with my grandparents
growing up
"It's just when they're gone, you're sorry you didn't miss the time with them."
so
mm
uh one thing I really wish I could remember I was a
I was a professional athlete at once and
I had celebrated until four in the morning and then I had my event at ten in the morning.
and uh
I was my xxx captain and I embarrassed my whole team
and uh
this is one thing I really regret
"I was a professional fighter, so..."
yeah <sigh> like no party thought about other people but me
mhm
uh
I studied massage therapy and got my nursing degree
um
and much of it was just on job training
around very close
uh
Because of my own injuries.
I had just gone through the therapy process and believed in people and saw how it worked
and I decided to do that I also wanted to help people
"Yeah, that's good."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Yes
I want to paint.
That's all I want to do is just paint <Laughter>
um
"I have two sons and it's time for me, uh"
to continue and they are older
and they can now take care of themselves
so I leave the area where my sons are
It's pretty hard.
"Yeah, that's good."
oh
the reflection of you <Laughter> the reflection of you
Reminds you so much.
who you are
Consistency
even if you are sick <Laughter> are consistent
I don't suppose my children are right or wrong.
I'll listen to her first.
And then I make my decisions
and I'm not trying to come from an emotional
increased space
I think logically and I put myself in her place
"Before I do, we'll discuss how hard it is to communicate in my family."
"Uh, because that's the only way we can get along is through communication."
how to communicate
"My family is pretty much separated, so my family and my relationship with my family"
on the reservation is very tight
"the rest of the family we are all fragmented and scattered around the southwest, so it is not very close to all"
uh
I have too many to count.
start with my uncle my uncle was like my father pulled me a good way
Uh xxx
"Uh he paid attention to me, he told me that he taught me hard work at a young age."
um
"He taught me to protect my family, too."
and taught me glory
taught me love
He's a good man.
"I haven't slept good night in years, so I got broken sleep."
uh dreams the dreams become too real
I get up and go to the toilet <Laughter> and go back to sleep <Laughter> I try <Laughter>
"Um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
my years of struggle it just uh it caught up to me
xxx
Uh reserved
"Yeah, that's good."
reserved and I'm trying to find things to distract my brain I'm thinking about different ways to do things
uh
mm
"Well, I got rid of t_v about eight months ago, so I got rid of this distraction, so what I'm doing now is"
I either paint
i Garden
or cleaning house washing dishes
"You know, or go out and go, that's another thing to do, a lot to go out these days"
Uh Anxiety <anxi> Anxiety <sigh> uh for a lot of worries
But it's good that I have techniques to calm down now.
um
nothing new
out of the normal
Yes
Uh three years before <sigh> around there three <sigh>
Insomnia
It was about
Two years ago around there
Two years ago I was released from therapy
"Oh, the therapist released me."
um
"Well, I had noticed that I'm still dealing with pictures and emotions"
"But what I do now is that I practice really hard, taking care of myself and coming to these places, the things that"
Hit me to get scared or excited or angry
I've learned how to
to work out of it and to realize that it is not real
It's not real.
It's just the emotion it's not really.
So these are the things I say to myself like little mantras
And that really helped me a lot from the therapy because it taught me that these emotions and pictures are really not real.
"and yes, so therapy has helped a lot, I mean, it's just it's changed my world"
Yes
at the same time as the p_t_s_d
Three years ago
♪ in my dreams ♪ When I dream ♪
last night
I only dreamed of fighting and then in preparation fighting fighters and that was another thing to build fear dreaming about preparing fighting fighters
and then step before thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams
So it's always mm what scares me in all my dreams that I would have made the train and ended the fight and I didn't
and so it builds fear and stress in me and then I tend to act in my sleep
"Yeah, that's good."
"as if it were real, as if I were there"
how I smell taste feel everything I was there
"Yeah, that's good."
This morning.
<Laughter> go here
Talk to my girlfriend
This mm
Trusted
he loves me I love him
He's our best friend.
I have to change zero
mm
I don't remember.
Regret
uh
just don't spend time with my grandparents and
"I think day to day problems maybe you know a couple here that I would have in the store first or something, but I mean"
"Yeah, it's nothing like this xxx"
"Stop thinking, you know everything"
"Yeah, that's good."
My Loyalty
my trustworthiness
mm starts a new art project yesterday
It was nice.
mm
"Well, I know."
We were in Santa Barbara and we found some stones and yes some old rocks that someone had made a pile and just threw a dump of old rocks out of the way and I walked through the heap of rocks and
I found this old rock that was in the middle.
"and I took it home and now I'm making a work of art on it and for me it was as if this thing was totally forgotten, was just looked at as a rock"
"And now it might be sitting on my grand table, you know, it's just for me that's really cool I like that"
mm
Start something
the
I'm so bad at it
that I don't think there's no way that I can be good at it and that I suddenly
"to be better at where I don't even have to think about it, just so good at it that I could just touch and feel it and I don't think about it"
These are the things I'm proud of.
I like that I like that
Performance can be said
