value
Yes
All right.
from Santa Monica
The people
mostly
"No, not much."
I can't afford to travel as much as I'd like.
mm I was an English major
Uh I just liked reading a lot at the time so
it sounded like the best thing good to study the funniest thing
not more
"Oh, I guess my dream job would be,"
manage a uh football club
"Oh, it would be pretty impossible for me"
I have no experience <Laughter> in this area
I'm very shy.
I play music
What do I do if I'm angry?
I don't know.
um
What do I do if I'm angry?
I can't think of anything I don't know.
I don't think I'm doing anything special.
"I would say very well, I don't lose my temper very often."
When was the last time I had a fight with someone?
I don't remember.
"Yeah, I don't have a lot of conflicts with people I can't remember the last time I had a fight with someone."
Let's see when I...
a small child
I was in front of my grandparents' restaurant.
and there was a robbery and I saw it well I saw it when the robbers went
um
"Yeah, maybe I'd want to erase this from my memory if I could"
"Well, I didn't know what was happening at that moment, so I didn't feel"
"so bad at the time, but I felt bad afterwards, because then"
um
"They know my mother was upset that my mother was there, and she had to call the police and it was"
It was disturbing to see her.
"You know, really disturbed, but"
"at the time when it actually happened, I wasn't really upset, it was more the aftereffects of him"
mm it was <wa> it was
< sigh> situation that
I don't know.
"Well, I can imagine that there's probably a million situations that I'd like <Laughter> I wish I'd treated differently, I can't think of one in particular"
um
Maybe
"I think when I was a kid,"
"Well, I think that when I was once seeing"
"Well, I've got okay, I've got a good one."
um
I didn't marry the girl I should have married.
so
That's a big one for me.
"Yeah, good."
we were together for about four years
"And I think I took her for granted, and I just didn't commit myself."
and
"That was a long time ago and now it's been so many years that I know I don't know that if it's a realization, but I think now that"
"Yeah, she should've been my wife, who we meant for each other or made for each other."
but because
my selfishness and because I just uh
had this fear of commitment at the time I just felt like I wasn't uh
"I didn't do what I should have done, what the smart thing would have been."
"Well, the last thing I can imagine I'd say I felt guilty about was"
No I feel a lot of guilt about my friendships I don't feel like I'm so good of a friend
"how I could be, but then at the same time I don't really know exactly what uh"
how I could be a better friend I just feel a little guilty that I'm not that I can't help anyone who has a problem I can't
I never feel like I can help anyone.
"who I know, who has a problem like this"
"Oh, that happens every day I think it happens to everyone I know and everyone"
all my relatives and all my friends I don't
I can really give them anything or help them in their lives.
"Well, they're..."
"It's very far away, it's just"
It's very warm and it's very uh
I don't know what it means.
"It's kept on a very surface level, I don't think they know that I don't think my family really knows me very well"
"and I don't know her very well, even in one not in a true sense"
so
"Yes, it is."
"I think a lot of families are like that, but it's"
It bothers me that mine is like this
"Oh, it's very simple, I sleep a lot, and I..."
"Yes, I have no problem sleeping at all"
No not really I would say
"she's like me, now it's the way I think I've been like this all my life"
"even when I was a little child, I also slept a lot and"
"No, I don't think I've changed a lot."
mm pretty low
But as I said
"in a way I could say, yes I feel really depressed, but then again"
I've always been like this
it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently like this
Yes
a long
"Oh, a long time ago, I was..."
about ten years old; or
around there over
I just missed a lot of school.
"I didn't want to go to school, so they sent me to"
to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh
It went from there
"No, I didn't go to therapy."
Since I was a teenager
All right.
I don't feel like it's even helping me.
so
One day I just...
decided that I don't want to go anymore
eh
"Like I said, I don't feel like it helped me."
So I guess I don't know it influenced me very much
"No, I wouldn't say"
Disturbing
no
mm
good I feel pretty happy when I see my nephew
and uh I have a
"The kids of my best friend are, I feel like they're my nephew and niece and I'm pretty happy when I'm around them."
My ideal weekend would be...
I would travel <tr> I would probably travel i would I
really enjoy just from the city every weekend around
Anywhere go really only everywhere from the city
"uh just see how different people live and how people are different wherever you go, I really think people are different when you're in different places and"
how they interact with you and how they see the world
different foods
um
and I also like historical places I'm in history and I and I enjoy just visiting somewhere that has some kind of
historical significance
"Oh, I haven't made a trip in a long time."
"the last trip I really did, I went to France for a wedding a few years ago"
and I had a really good time there and I always wanted to go to Paris and so I went to Paris and then I went to a small town
um
That's a few hours from Paris where the actual wedding was
"and yes, it was really funny, I think the church where the wedding was uh like a thousand years old so"
"Yes, it was a really cool trip"
I don't know what would be considered unforgettable.
uh
an unforgettable experience
probably the most memorable experience I guess would be easy
nothing special than living with the girl I just told you earlier that I think now
that we would have
Married
um
"this is something that remains in my memory, so I say it's unforgettable because"
It's still with me and...
"It's something I don't think you know well, I know I'll never forget, but it's not just"
mm specific day or moment you know
"Oh, a lot..."
I wish I could be healthier.
"for one thing, uh more energy"
and
more friendly good no I think I'm pretty friendly
but more uh more based on more social <s> more uh more social
around these two things mainly I think I would like to get more socially excited and more
and healthier
"Oh, that's a good question, my best friend, how would my best friend describe me, I think"
I think he'd say that I
"a very <sigh> good it sounds cheesy, but it <laughter> he would probably say that I am a very spiritual person"
and that I give very much I think I'm much more selfish than people think I'm but people think I'm not selfish
um
and probably he would say that I'm creative too

good my advice to myself
I don't understand the question <Laughter>
"Yeah, but we've already talked about it."
I don't think I really believe in being proud or proud.
"I don't think it's really something you can be proud of, but I can't really think about it."
Results achieved
"anyway, even if I had something <laughter> to be proud of no, I can't think of anything <anythi> some kind of performance I had"
uh something I recently did that I really enjoyed
"Well, I sang karaoke with some friends of mine"
"<Laughter> and I don't usually do that, but"
"Yeah, I had one, it was a lot of fun a few days ago"
Thank you.
