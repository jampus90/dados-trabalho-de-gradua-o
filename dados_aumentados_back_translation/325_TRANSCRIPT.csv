"Um, I'm fine, it's a little weird that you're talking to a virtual person."
around I was born I was born in l_a I was raised in the suburbs around I have lived everywhere I have lived in the valley long beach and now I am in the culver city
um
there's good food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it's not getting cold I don't have to shovel snow
there are many ways a lot of variety all different types of people uh I think this is really great
This is a much longer list I like to get out of here
"The traffic I think is number one, I think everyone hates traffic and everyone's so busy, all the time it's really hard to be with someone who's so interested in their job and, uh, we're also in traffic."
I just graduated to have studied marine biology
"I was I was going to school and I was originally studying graphic design and I found this kind of unfulfilled, so I made a trip for a while traveling around the world and started diving and I realized that I really loved marine biology so I came into it"
"Everyone asked me that lately since I graduated, I think I'd like to take a breath."
"Um, I think maybe"
Management of research
"You know, I'm not sure I'd like to."
something in tropical marine ecology perhaps like a nature reserve to manage something like the
it is a difficult question to answer <Laughter>
I know.
um
I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world
Now I traveled to Central America for eight months
um and I visited a variety of different countries i
I went diving.
I think I think intolerance injustice in the world these are probably the things that fire me the most
vent makes my friend that count <Laughter>
"I'm pretty good, it takes a lot to really get me to the point where I kind of blow my top the very few people who have seen me angry around"
"up to the point where I scream and scream angry, I don't know that I just don't get there, I think I'm a little afraid of losing my temper, so I keep it under control"
"It was yesterday when I was arguing with my friend about it,"
"getting a job, I talked about taking a job somewhere, and he was very supportive and I really wanted him to say no go not take this job for six months because I miss you and he was just supportive so around"
"We argued about this <Laughter> and it was ridiculous, so we laughed at the end and that was the end of the fight"
"To meditate, go into nature to stay away from the computer, away from technology, away from people."
I'd say not really around I'm a single child and it's just me and my parents and we're very dissimilar for example around I'm a pretty adventurous person and I like learning and my parents are uh
"Couch potatoes that they like to watch reality television, so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do to as far as common activities, so you know I love them and everything, but there's not too much common reason"
"Yeah, I think I'm a very social introvert, but I..."
"seem to find the most social encounters to empty out where, as my friend for example, he around conducts a lot of joy and energy to people for me it's always a little the opposite that I need to charge"
"I don't know if I have a best friend, but I guess I'll tell my friend he's kind of my standard best friend."
"He would probably say passionately intelligent, he always tells me that I'm really hard on me, which is true to be loyal."
"I think I'm just proud of who I am xxx I don't know if that's the answer most people give, but I think I'm"
I'm really proud of who I am I'm trying really hard around I have a lot of things in my life I'm a really good person I think it's kind of rare to find people who are friendly and I look at myself
"a friendly person who cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so I'm proud of it"
< slaughter>
No I didn't
no
Yes
"I was probably about fifteen at the time, so I think eight was that seventeen years ago"
Yes
I cut and my
named one of my best friends
"to call my parents and let them know and at this point they took me with them for treatment, I wasn't the first time I'd ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before it was more, they thought I had a_d_h_d so much"
It was more <m> I think my parents really took me in instead of asking me for help
"I haven't stopped for about three years, uh, because it felt like I checked in with a probation officer I just didn't enjoy the relationship I had, but I still have the psychiatrist I'm going to for medical controls"
< slaughter>
"I think it's useful if you have the right therapist, I think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist, it can be incredibly harmful that I have spoken to people who have had bad experiences and will never go back."
lately I've been a little down around I should say a little down as usual because I graduated and
my routine to go to school
and make school supplies twenty-four seven has come to an end and without the routine it is a little
Strange to find out what to do with mine
to find a way to be productive and to know what to do with my time is also a little bit to
Depressive statement that my intelligence and good grades at school do not translate into real world skills and there are not so many jobs for marine biologists in California
"Almost impossible since I was a little kid, I've had trouble falling asleep and..."
"About four years ago it really got bad, where I just couldn't sleep through the night I got about four hours of sleep"
"sometimes I would wake up every hour and I would only wake up a complete wreck in the morning, so for about four years I've been taking Trazadone so I can sleep"
"You're a virtual person, so you probably didn't see that, but it's pretty much like I"
"I'm just a panicked, terrified wreck that I'm losing my ability to deal with."
"I'm losing my ability to deal with things I'm much more likely to lose my temperaments, I can't regulate my moods, I'm just really volatile"
Probably a few months ago I think I might have been on a trip away for a weekend and forget to take my medicine with me or something and then I can't sleep and so it's what happens
uh <makes sounds with mouth>
really happy I mean to
"I don't know, it's easy for me to keep track of when I feel really bad really happy I think I felt happy on New Year's Eve"
"really happy on New Year's Eve, that was around"
Ten days ago I was with my friend and some friends and we went on a trip to Palmspring and Joshua tree and it was really nice to see them
"I can't see them very often because I was in school and I was so busy, so it was really a nice reintroduction to real life."
"I think I'm nice, I'm considerate, I'm tolerant, I'm pretty open-minded, I'm aware of my mistakes."
I'm just trying to be nice to everyone and
I'm very curious about the world and things I don't know that I really like to learn
Uh from the top of my head first thing that came to mind is diving the blue whole in Belize it was really
Me and my friends we know have jumped off the boat and you come across the edge of this
Uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just fall on about forty-hundred feet in
"something like two minutes, we did it pretty fast not everyone could do it so fast and around when you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge, they're bigger than people and because it's that"
Cave system and it is really cloudy and there are sharks swimming everywhere around you so
that was pretty good <Laughter>
I try to remember that I haven't had much free time in the last three and a half years when I was in school around <Laughter> so I guess reading hiking around
I'm just dating my friends.
relatively low key things going in movies with dinner parties cooking with my cat playing
"not that I can really think about it, I'm sure I made mistakes in my life, but you know I'm still here, so I can't be that bad"
hmm
um
"I don't know if you're holding on to your clothes, 'cause the '90s are back in fashion."
hmm
to be cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets in around outside in nature
Type of away from the hub of the city get a good note <Laughter>
"I think my friend just gave it up, especially last year, he really inspired me that he stopped drinking he stopped smoking he's"
"He really inspired me that he stopped drinking, he made many positive changes in his life and I know these things aren't difficult or not easy, I should say to <t> to see someone overcome such a thing that"
I was really inspired.
All right.
