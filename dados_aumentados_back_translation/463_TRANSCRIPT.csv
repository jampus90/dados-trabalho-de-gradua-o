value
<sync>
"Yes, I am."
I'm pretty good
Uh I was born in los angeles california
Yes
I like the fact that everything is close to all the shops the shops
xxx
around the traffic <Laughter>
"I traveled, but not too much."
Uh going away from your usual days to explore new sights
um
three weeks ago a month ago I went to read vegas
uh with <wit> me and my friends and we just went sightseeing
um
in las vegas we went to the Hoover Dam
and around it was breathtaking around
which it was really big and we saw the great gorge and it was impressive that I have never seen anything like this
I studied nursing
I graduated two months ago.
So I took my uh board exam to be licensed
"and I passed, so I'm just waiting for my license in the mail"
my dream job is to be a registered nurse
um
"A long time ago, when I was a little boy, I was hurt"
And my parents had to take me to the hospital
and
The doctors came by and they had to sew me on the leg.
and I saw all this and that made me want to track it the medical field
"Yes, I'm very happy"
my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it is it between <Laughter>
"I'm close, I'm very close to them."
mm
"When I have a problem, I go to them for help"
um
Someone who was a positive influence was my best friend.
since primary school
Yes
"Yeah, we've known each other since we were in third grade."
And we went to primary school and high school together.
"and he lives like two blocks away, so he's basically like a brother of me"
I'm shy
um
I really don't know that I've always been a quiet person.
Since I can remember
What do you want me to do?
I'm going to my room I turn on my a_c
and I just relax in my bed <Laughter>
I'm pretty good I'm pretty good at controlling my temperament yes
The last time I had a fight with someone
was about
um
Work
I was disappointed
"not angry, just disappointed"
because my manager
He wanted me to do it.
do something faster than what I usually can handle
and he already knew that
"My workload was a lot, but he didn't understand how sad it made me."
mm
I can't remember one.
the toughest decision
I ever had to do was
Early school leaving
um
I felt that I wasn't really part of it
far away from home
And so
I just thought I was in a major I didn't really like.
And so
I have decided not to go the next semester and go home l_a
"To the moment I see it, yes, I'm very happy that I did that"
because I didn't go to nursing school and I wouldn't have been a licensed nurse now.
I don't have an event.
um
It depends on the days I work or where I don't work.
Yes
I work at a store early in the morning.
I'm leaving at 3:00 in the morning.
And I'll be out at ten.
So it's really hard for me to get a good night's sleep
"if I don't sleep well, I can be a little grumpy"
Irritated
or just frustrated with the situation
"I've been okay lately, okay, I've been good."
"No, I didn't."
no
no
hmm
the last time I was really happy and excited when I found out that I passed my license board exam to be a nurse
< slaughter>
my best friend would have described me as a nice sweet shy quiet guy
"To speak physically, I would change how I look from the outside"
um
I'm a little overweight
and I'd like to
lose some weight and just look good from the outside
hmm
I don't have any.
"No, I don't know."
To this one time
"When I work, it's a store."
i
I took some goods without buying them.
It was a risk that I took
but
since no one was there and
the opportunity <opp> the opportunity was right there for me to get it I just got it and I took it home
I don't know.
Yes last weekend I went to I went farm sale with my family
and it was pretty funny and going on different yard sales and
find uh random things
To I bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was
on it was only for two dollars and so I got it
and now it's in my room and I'm sitting on it <Laughter>
I'm very proud of the fact that I'm a nurse
that I'm a nurse around I'm just waiting for my license in the mail and
after that I would simply send my resumes to various hospitals and xxx and nursing homes
See you.
