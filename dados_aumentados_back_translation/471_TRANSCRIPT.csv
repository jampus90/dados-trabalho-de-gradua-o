value
<sync>
Yes
"I'm fine, thank you."
from los <l> los narrowes
mm-sports outdoors
Surfing Uh Snowboarding Mountain biking Climbing
Transport
Yes
Experience different cultures
I love going to Mexico.
"and uh anyway it's so much different from California and Western culture, so to say, Mexico is a Western civilization, but"
the height of the
Entertainment and level of education is so much different that they are like two different worlds
Traveling you mean
uh
"I would have to say to go to an island off the coast of Figi, the name is tavarua"
and it is a very small island around which you can walk in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes
and it's a place where you go to surf and it's an incredible
uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place
I've studied biology
"I was pushed from behind by my father, who was a doctor, and he wanted me to be a doctor."
I don't work at all in
Business Units Now
"Yes, I am."
my dream job would be to be a missionary
Yes
"The original goal of my father, when he became an M_D, was to become a missionary and he is a very"
Generous person and I think I'm also I got that from him uh hereditary
"But I'd like to help people, and I don't think a doctor helps people, I really don't think it's insincere to say that you help people while you stuff wads of money in your pocket."
I'd like to build uh people houses and help them find freshwater springs things like this if I could afford to travel to remote places like this
I'm practicing
I think I'm pretty good at it uh
I think I'm pretty effective at that.
it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend
and it was about their lack of consideration
um
I felt frustrated
hmm
a situation which:
I wish I could handle it differently.
I anyway in my later years I would say anyway I didn't have many regrets in my younger years I uh
people are sniffed and I would keep my mouth shut and I wouldn't say anything I wouldn't express my dissatisfaction about their actions or behavior
I would just close my mouth and internalize my feelings that I learned that
It's so wrong
And so
in the probably last fifteen to twenty years I have made it to a point to my vocalize
Dissatisfaction with someone's actions immediately and that
Uh takes care of the anger right away
"Yeah, it depends on what you mean with trouble, uh I think"
anyway all the way around as soon as you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end
It diffuses the problems rather than
prolonged or delayed the disturbance
I go back it would be not to pursue uh medicine as my father wanted us to argue
Length for many
Months and years over this and uh finally I've overwhelmed and uh I don't go
"I didn't go on this route, but that was probably the most..."
uh difficult period
in my life
mm there was a time when I wish I could erase a female interaction uh friends and their
Uh betrayal uh but now I realize that
Keeping these memories makes me who I am today and
and dealing with them defines who I am today
uh my parents died I had very good relationships with my parents uh I'm very grateful for the
Although my father was a little bit a uh
Hard Hand Uh
and draconian < laughter> person uh we came to an understanding long before he died
And uh my brothers I get along well with my younger brother
but my older brother has problems he has uh psychological problems and she continues to plague and influence him
"Me, too."
just knowing he's going through uh turbulence
"Well, I guess I can't handle it because..."
He's clinically depressed.
And he has suicidal tendencies
"And he doesn't work, he's very educated."
And he's not talking to me.
"and his family abuses him very much, it's a not happy relationship for his family"
Yes
"You know, I'd have to say my father's my hero, he's my model."
"He's my archetype for what a man was supposed to be, and he was inconspicuously honest."
"And kind,"
But on the other hand he had high expectations of me and my two brothers.
"eh normally, once my head hits the pillow I'm dead sleeping like a tree trunk, but lately I just uh last night I couldn't sleep I woke up at two"
and I feel it's because of a cancer diagnosis I received a month ago
um
xxx i using my own personal uh methods of dealing with stress
I'm okay I'm probably 90 percent okay
Ten percent of uncertainty about the future
on the question of whether:
I'm gonna survive this or not
not really
no
Never
Never
oh I was either surfing or snowboarding
or climbing or mountain biking uh I always experience joy when I train at a very high level of effort
funny
jovial
uh uh intelligent a perfectionist
No one asked me that.
Maybe
will my uh submerge
Hedonistic Self
"I look at myself again, my father fills my consciousness, he was the ultimate..."
Uh Postponer of Satisfaction
he
Set
now behind him and he put what will be in the future
"in his eyes, and he never let go of it, and that made him the self-made man he was."
Considering that I am always looking for the present
"How I feel now and it's difficult for me,"
Uh slog through a mile full of uh shit to get at a price that's so far away
< deep breath> it would be
My ex-boss
"And he started using me on my last day of work when he fired me, he started using me"
I turned to him and I said you can't talk to me like that.
and he continued to use more profanity
to uh
"I spoke out against it again, and then he fired me, and that's still in my head, and that's what happened."
A year and a half ago
mhm
everything I regret uh yes I don't regret getting married and having children
"I suppose I could, but I think that"
That would have taken away the many opportunities I had
and I took to travel the world and experience different cultures because
that's what I enjoy most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my consciousness
"For the united states are not the end of the world, but only when one can travel can one find out that we are not."
we have not been going to
Uh level of uh life around the world other people think that we're the only ones who think that and I don't agree
mm
that's a good one I'd say
<Laughter> I'd say just enjoying life because you never know when it's coming to an end and I think I've done that
and uh I could come to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so
"I think I've done it, I'm so happy with my life"
i
has been
Climbing lessons I have a uh part-time task of teaching climbing
and many of these people have never done it before
and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this could have changed their lives so
that was very gratifying to me
< Deep breath>
I would say <sigh> my
Devotion to
Environment
"I wasn't always an environmentalist, but..."
I used myself vocally for being an ahem.
"Uh, a steward."
"the environment, because today they are a lot of people who"
Environmental pollution with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septically uh things like this and
I get up and I've been talking on t_v and on uh youtube against these people who pollute the environment
You're welcome.
Goodbye.
