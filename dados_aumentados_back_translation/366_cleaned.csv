value
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm fine.
and you
Uh los close california
Uh <sigh> I like the variety
I feel that l_a alone is a country where there is so much to do to explore
And there is nothing like that.
Traffic <Laughter> I'd say traffic and property prices are kind of crazy compared to the rest of the country
"But unlike that, you know it's okay."
I've traveled around I've traveled a bit
"I'd like to travel more, but I've travelled to a few countries."
I've been with you before.
"I will not say that Europe is a continent, I was in London, I was born here, but my family is from Nigeria, so I was in Nigeria."
a few times I was in Denmark
um amsterdam
I was where else I went.
um
"and I think that's it, I think that's it yeah think that's it"
"Yeah, that's good."
simply explore uh explore <exp> discover new places to see new things that meet new people a different culture
It's definitely...
um
gives you appreciation for life
and the diversity of it and also go to countries that may not
"how developed, how the u_s it definitely gives you a greater appreciation for you know this country"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Okay well, uh, see london I accident actually when I first heard that I was going to london, I wasn't really interested because I didn't know much about it, the only thing I remember I remember"
Sees Mary Poppins <Laughter> and around
"But when I went there, I absolutely fell in love with him, just breathe."
it still has the hectic pace of l_a
but at the same time you can drive at a very slow pace around we have no we just
went on the tube
It's her way like the subway station I totally fell in love with.
and
just to explore different parts of the city we went to know you large Ben Westminster Abbey
"In fact, when I went there, they had the premiere of, uh, what a movie that was."
Slumdog Millionaire
and they also had the premiere for
seven seven pounds it was a movie with Will Schmied
"They did it so that the blacksmith was over there, and we knew it."
"Me and my friends were like screaming like we were like groupies <Laughter> just you know, just knowing <Laughter> just for antiques, but, um, it was a lot of fun it was a lot of fun"
"Yeah, that's good."
"uh business management and an option in personnel management, which means I have no idea <Laughter>"
um
Good question
I've always been
I've always wanted to go to business.
"and I've always wanted to study finance, but"
I didn't think I'd learn too much about finance.
"college per se I think I've learned more in the real world, which is not"
"So the other option was Human Resource and I'm always fascinated that you know relationships and people always like to read articles about the stuff, so I went for the"
"No <Laughter> Well, I still kind of use what I've learned, but I work in real estate management"
"So, um..."
It still has to do with people who have to do with people I'm fascinated by.
so
"Yeah, that's good."
That was a good...
my dream job wow
I'd say I'm a life coach.
"I would say that would be my dream job, because I love helping people to succeed and I help"
"I love it, part of someone else's success even not, no matter how small it is"
Whether it's words of encouragement or helping someone to find a situation
"I like to help just how to help people have a better life, so I think uh"
"You know, but I'm doing it for free, I'd do it for free, like all day"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's good."
more outgoing
In any case more outgoing I'm usually around
"life is good it's strange because I'm usually considered the life of the party, I'm the one who cracks jokes and makes everyone laugh at the same time, I can be very"
quiet and for me
so
"Yeah, that's good."
Right
"<sigh> to relax, I usually listen to music"
I usually listen to music to relax or i
Pray
to relax or listen to some really quiet music
so
"Yeah, that's good."
Very good
very very good I used to uh
"I wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but I was known for it."
"Go off quote on quote <Laughter> not in one not in one you know, don't throw chairs or something, but"
I'm a very patient person.
but once this patience <patien> is gone and for you to do that you really really really really need to press my buttons for a long time and when it's finished i
I'm just going away.
Not mm mm
no
The last time I had a fight with someone I haven't had a fight with in a long time.
To <sigh>
Boy
mm
Uh I argued with my
no
I'd say my father had a fight with him.
um
about <sigh> xxx what was it about
um
We disagreed on some things when we wanted to go back to Nigeria.
and
He didn't listen.
"It was a kind of group discussion, me and my siblings."
and he was very subjective he was not open to other people suggestions and suggestions and concerns
So around it started an argument
Very
uh
"I wouldn't say angry at myself, but I felt very"
It's like I lost control.
I'm the guy where I like to have and feel control over my emotions and thoughts
"As soon as this patience is gone and I start to run away, it's kind of like"
This...
you know
"I won't call it blurry, but"
I'm very funny and fast with what I say so
I'll say something you know right away
"until not necessarily hurting, but to very directly and to the point and I make sure that my point over"
"Yeah, that's good."
around I have three brothers one one younger two older I am very close to my family and my mother is one of my best friends
To <sigh>
My brothers are great around
Love her to death
oh my father anyway he's more like that from the picture
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm not really the culprit <Laughter> I don't feel
"Guilty I am not to shy away from what I have done and I definitely own up to what I do, I am not a shy away from responsibility, but I don't think I'll ever feel"
Guilty
for everything I do
"Yeah, I don't think I feel like I don't usually feel guilty."
"Yeah, that's good."
Pretty simple
To be fairly simple at <a> at <a>
"Yes, I'm pretty good at falling asleep except when I'm excited and when I read < laughter>, when I try when I'm, when I'm focused on something like learning, I'm going to read and read and read"
Even when it's past my bed
But now I'm trying to work on
Wake up much earlier
"then when I am now and this is kind of a fight <st> a bit of a fight, but I come to him so"
Good
um
"I have the feeling I feel good, you know I'm generally I have a very happy disposition"
And so
no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever I feel like I'm going
I won't allow myself to go to this place.
nah
no
I'm sorry.
Thoughts
I'd say
"Well, it's I wouldn't say necessarily changes, but I would say moreso behaviors learn how to"
Let go of the past decisions
Maybe and somehow how they played their course in my life
um
I just look back sometimes and say what if I had done what
How would life be now
no
"So these are some games I play, but different from the"
That's it.
hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter> hm <Laughter>
Regret
uh
no
no mm mm there is nothing I regret
Ten to twenty years ago
I'd say you're not afraid of who you are
to be authentic
um
even more important with yourself
Delete from my memory
uh
"Boy, that's a good one."
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
uh
Wow
Delete from my memory
uh
I'd say when I told my father to behave like a father.
Maybe I shouldn't
"Yeah, there was..."
That was actually one of the times I used to go around with him another time
uh
Basically I had decided not to go to a private to not go away for college
So I decided to stay here so I could take care of my little brother.
and around my senior year I was overloaded with everything I had maybe like
uh four a_p classes
I worked at I worked three jobs at that time and I was also in track and field
so
"Needless to say, I was <Laughter> i i i i was kind of like burning myself"
I was kind of like burning myself out.
and
I was not good at a_p calculus because I decided to go to a j_c first and also transfer to save money for college
And when I told him that you know the teacher said I was going to fall asleep in class just because I was working an eight-hour shift after school because I was a retail manager back then.
"So, um..."
and I would come home after the shift to do homework mm calculus let alone
Uhm so uh
"He would get upset and I told him that I talked to my advisor, I already told him that I don't need this course to go to J_C, is not something I'm going on with, so I just can't get off."
"at this point in time, so I'll just know,"
You just know it
Take the
d or fail whatever
And he didn't like it because he's a teacher <Laughter> I think maybe that's where it might have come from.
And so
he started blaming like my jobs and wanted to call my boss and it was just too much and I told him
"You know, since you're my father, you should act like that."
but I was it was a more aggressive <laughter> as I said it so
That was...
One thing
oh I really do I remember I regret one thing
"And that's, I wish I'd keep going."
To go with college in the whole
"As if I burned myself out to spread myself too thin, I was actually on the right track to graduate from college."
I'd like to say nineteen
Because I started doing college classes in the high school early Sophomore year
in high school
"but I was working with this stuff and stuff with my dad and I kind of stopped working to school for a while and just worked, but I went back to finish so I wish I just had"
"Continuation maybe that's a small thing, but"
That's a little thing.
"Yeah, that's good."
hmm
I'm very
I am a very compassionate and understanding person
um
I like to learn new things around I'm a very happy person People come to me for advice I'm very objective
"I'll tell you what's good, what's bad, what's ugly."
and
"Yes, these are some of my best qualities yeah"
"and I'm fun I like to have fun I'm going to have fun in any situation I can make light out of any situation as I'm the type of person I can break the tension in space, the type of"
this type of uh <tisk> around
Personality
"Yeah, that's good."
I wish I was bigger <Laughter> around
Except my size
hmm
"I wish,"
ah
Maybe
I don't know if it's uh.
be more
"I won't say more in contact with my emotions, but I think"
I'd say
Understanding people is how people think about me in their shoes
I think that would be one thing because I'm the kind of person
where:
"People say they love me or take care of me and I'm okay great thanks I appreciate that, but I don't know how much"
I think that's a realization of how much they care about me and love me.
That's one thing I like
Getting more
on a
Take a look at this.
<laughter> my best friend <deep breath> uh she describes me as someone funny
Crazy
um
Objective
to be loyal
Ambitious hard work around
"If I'm just kidding, she says you're so mean, but..."
"I just like it, I joke around all the time and all the way around"
"We just planned, uh"
a friend of mine or a friend of ours to have a baby shower
"I'll give her some ideas, and there's another friend who's been invited,"
"We've had some problems in the past, and someone I don't talk to or hang out with has always been very close to us, but I don't really talk to that person, but I don't mind them being there."
So she also talked about celebrating her birthday
also at kind of like after the baby shower
"And there's another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower, for whom we really didn't do anything, and I'm like good, if we celebrate this person's birthday, we could just as well definitely"
"You know, honor this person's birthday too, as we are closer to you know that the person xxx birthday has passed"
And I said you know exactly why we don't all celebrate birthday
<Laughter> Forget the baby shower just do the birthdays
and then that's when she said you were so mean <Laughter> but she laughed about it so
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's good."
of which I am very proud in my life <deep breath>
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
I would say to be there for my family.
to be a spiritually and emotionally strong person
Family has gone through a lot of challenges and many times I've been the one to make sure that
everything goes all right and everything ensures that everything goes all the way
So I'd say more than anything to make sure I was there for my family.
"Yeah, that's good."
oh
"Okay, thanks."
"Bye, you got a good one."
