hi
Yes
today is a wonderful day I just do absolutely wonderful
I was born in Cleveland ohio I was raised in Tucson Arizona and came to go narrowes when I was sixteen years old
Yes
I've only been back once since I left.
It's a completely different one
Community
When I grew up I am so glad that I grew up there because it was a great feeling of community that I think we're not going to be in los anles <sniffle>
My grandmother died and left property for my father.
So we came here to manage their property.
It was pretty easy for me to be young.
"and it was easy to adapt, so I'm pretty good at meeting people, so uh, that's never been a problem that I traveled a lot as a kid"
So I was used to moving and going to new places
"meeting new people, seeing new things, it's an adventure and I like the adventurous life"
"Oh, one of my best trips I've had was in"
"Nineteen I am with myself, but nineteen sixty four < sniffle> I came out here to visit my grandmother from Cleveland"
Ohio and I went to an Indian reservation
"and I got a little note card about the reservation when I came home, I wrote to the reservation and I told them when I came back <ca> went back to school in September I would have to write"
"Uh, a talk rather about what I did in the summer and I told them I wanted to,"
to talk about going to the Indian reservation and they would send me something and they sent me this
Large
Kachina Indian doll
"and that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth it now, if I still had it, I found out like a quarter of a million dollars so"
mm
but this is one of the best xxx
I could be a little bit of both.
"I'm pretty when I have to be, I can be walking because I'm good at meeting people and meeting people, but sometimes I have a little bashful side, a little shy side of me too"
So a little bit of both
I studied business administration <ad> Administration with a focus on marketing and advertising
"Well, I really started in computer science, but that was when computer science wasn't what it is today."
"and around me I liked <li> I was good at it, but it wasn't interaction with people and I love people"
So I wanted something that would bring me
"Interaction with people, so I went into marketing"
and I worked for a t_v station where I go to school so that in line in marketing advertising fit so
"No, now I'm a photographer I'm a celebrity photographer I shoot many stars"
I shoot on the red carpet
I shoot a lot of special events and everything else people pay me for <Laughter>
"It's not hard at all, it's my passion, I love it, it's like not working"
I'm in my dream job
I just need to get more.
"Jobs <j> Jobs pay me well, because there are many times as a photographer that you have to do many things <thin> to get events known for free"
"so it's a process of building relationships, so I'm still in this process of building relationships"
"so I can get more paid jobs, but this is my dream job I love, what I do"
"Well, now I'm really back in it I've got it for a while, then I got away from it, but it's meditation"
I practice meditation and try to do it twice a day in the morning
"and the night before I go to sleep, I work with Oprah and Deepak Chockera and everyone else who provides me with meditation and I use that to"
Calm down my body
"I can generally control my temperament, sometimes I get hired, I think like any other human person <per> Being, but I'm working on trying to keep a moderate and moderate"
uh temperament in the personality
oh wow we I argued with my daughter the other day about something I said and I didn't want to say it hurt her
But it has obviously
and we argued about what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt them mm and maybe what I said did
and that's what the argument started
"Oh God, I felt terrible because I never intended to hurt my daughter"
And I'd never want to hurt her
"and I felt bad that she had been hurt by what I had said, so I had to guard my words and watch my thoughts"
"Well, I don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away, so it's just my two daughters here with me"
"and we have a pretty good relationship you know we're trying to work my daughter is a make-up artist and I'm a photographer, so we work a lot together in the industry so"
Sometimes I think we're too close.
we need a little more space
"Yes, if I say the wrong things <Laughter>"
"No, it's never easy to be a parent, it's a job in work"
sometimes making the right decisions
love the feeling of consummation
that you could educate the highest creation on this planet
to be a
uh wonderful and productive person
"I'm not as strict as my parents, I give my children a little more freedom to find out who they are"
"I'm not really religious as they do, but I'm very spiritual"
So I raised her differently from myself on the religious tip.
and
I'm more I listen to her more I think than what my parents did it was
You were to be seen and not to be heard when I grew up and I let my children's voice hear
"One night I had a bad night that changed my life and I don't know that I want to go into details, I feel bad about that night <Laughter>"
"Yes, I could have stayed at home <Laughter>"
Wow I'm trying to think about a situation
Maybe dealing with how I and my husband divorced I think I could have treated this a little differently
We really loved each other very much and it was just something that made a
an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive
"And I think we both could have done better, but I think I've played a part in keeping a lot of drama going."
"Because I was hurt, we broke up and somehow ravaged, because I wanted my child to be raised with her father."
"So I think it's looking back now, what you know, that the review is twenty-two visions."
"I could have handled things a little better, but what can you do if you knew better?"
the hardest decision I've ever had to make
The hardest decision I've ever had to make was that I was on my way to work on a plane when a enrollment consultant had a stroke.
wanted to establish a connection
and
to get into the other plane and then go to the hospital and a doctor sat behind me
And he told me
that I couldn't get on the plane
Because I could have another stroke that was a tough decision because I was all alone in Dallas texas.
"I didn't mean that I was in there with an employee, but I would be left alone because my employees had to go on."
"to Montgomery Alabama, where we went"
and I had to make a decision should I stay or should I go
but my life was in balance
"So I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital, but that was a tough one."
"ugh overwhelmed I mean here I'm on my way to work you know, I flew to different states every week"
and uh to help get kids admitted to college and here I'm on my way to work
and I'm on a plane and I feel this
Strange feeling coming across the left side of my body
"and I say my prayers and I go to sleep and then when I wake up to get out of the plane, I can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment that I did every week, so I knew something was wrong"
It was when you came into your life.
"and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's going to happen next, so it was very disturbing"
Very traumatic
"And I know you don't know what's happening to you, it's the weirdest thing you're riding to."
the hospital in a
medical ambulance
That was a strange experience.
"Yeah, but I'm here."
"I know I survived, the doctor told me no one survived a stroke on a plane and I survived so"
the universe wasn't finished with me yet
"You know what that is, sometimes I have a little problem with it."
Sleep a little sometimes i
"I'm wired <Laughter> I'm wired just because I'm one of those real energetic people and I have to finish what I was going to do and until I'm done I can't go to sleep, so sometimes it's hard for me to sleep other times I can lie down and just walk, but depends on what's going on in my head"
I'm sluggish.
Probably a little at the edge
but I'm trying to keep a happy personality I'm a real energetic person
"So I'm trying, but you know, when you're tired, your body's still talking to you."
so
"lately I felt really good, except"
I ate something.
"Problems because I've had one since I had the stroke, I have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so I thought it's been over a year since I had the stroke, but I thought it would have gotten a little better now and it's not but I'm so grateful to be alive."
that this is really small <mi> small compared to the larger picture and I wasn't
Fortunately <for> luckily
I have not lost my facial structure or
"You know, my face isn't messed up, how many people are, I can still use my hands, which I can still shoot with my camera, although my left hand in use is diminished."
but I can shoot as a photographer with my right hand so I can still do my job
So you know I have to hold a good blow
Energy goes on for me to keep being successful for me
"No, but I've been through depression."
I was beaten unconscious five times when I was a teacher.
"every ball there was that you could call football baseball basketball names, the ball hit me in my head and I suffered from"
how to have sleep apnea and cannot sleep
so often to be hit and knocked unconscious in the head
so
"No, just I'm not going to therapy because"
"I don't have medicine right now, so I can't get therapy that they only offer people with medicine."
it's hard to get it < sniffle> and then I don't work < work> yes it sucks I don't work now because I'm still trying to get my disability
so that I
Get healthy
Because I want to be a fulfilled person and I want to be total and you know the system will take almost two years before I go to a hearing.
So that's kind of depressing
"to think after all the years I've worked since I was sixteen and it takes me, it's been over a year, it's been a year"
I had the stroke February two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and I will not be hearing by September two thousand thirteen just to tell me if I
"getting the disability or not, that was very depressing for me because I wonder where I lived from my savings last year"
"and I brought my daughter through college, she's done and now she has to take care of me and she's still looking for a job"
and my life is kind of in the air right now
"'Cause I wonder what's next, so I'm just praying for leadership."
I feel happy every day I wake up
and I can breathe and I can see
and I can go and I can talk and I can still shoot my photo I'm glad it's just a good thing
to be alive and alive in the present moment
"You know what I thought, like what are good regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change here and now"
So just go forward live <li>
What advice would I give myself < sniffle> let nothing in your way
you know that you keep a good personality and an energetic mind and just push on
energetically talkative
uh won't take no for an answer uh follow by reliable
good spirited
Lovingly Give
I'm very proud of it.
"I could find out my creative side, I was a visual artist, I've never taken an art lesson."
I taught art < sniffle> around I was
"in my late twenties, before I even discovered that I could draw and paint"
I'm a doll collector
"I am my creative side, which I am most proud of because it was able to help me."
"being creative I can do no matter what, even though I was still very sick of a stroke I could still walk"
and just go take pictures and that was so
Reassuring for my soul
that I am I am glad that I have a creative side and that I have found it and have used it
mhm
uh huh
And that's that it's good-bye
See you.
