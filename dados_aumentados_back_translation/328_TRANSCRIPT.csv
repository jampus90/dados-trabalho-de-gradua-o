value
Yes
< slaughter>
How are you?
uh watts california but now I live in west l_a
<Laughter> yes
I love the sunshine I love the palm trees I love that around you are thirty minutes away from everything it is a great city
the traffic is terrible
I studied child development
"Yeah, actually, I teach kids how to be safe in uh traffic situations"
"Oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker, that's what I want to do, I want to die by doing this job movies"
"Well, when I was in high school, I did a lot of theater productions and I love everything about film, so I once had the opportunity to make a movie because I didn't get a job as an actor, I just became addicted I love film making"
< slaughter>
"Last time I made a film, only this last October made a short film."
"There are about three people who connect, but they come to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they originally imagined."
Thank you.
really crazy uh
<Laughter> really crazy i
"You know, I guess what makes me really angry is when my daughter is acting stupid at school, when she doesn't do her job, and when she doesn't watch and I get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences, that's what makes me angry."
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, yeah, it sucks that she's one of the smartest kids in her school."
"No, it's very difficult because many things in themselves that"
"They're going negative to them and it's as if you're fighting against yourself trying to change, but you know that little person you are"
"You know a hundred times, and it's just hard to deal with, but..."
"except that it's okay, but being a parent is never easy"
<Sigh>
the hardest part about being a parent
"I'd say,"
try to give
"this little person so much life experience, so they don't make mistakes or so they don't get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away, but then they don't do it so"
It's getting very uh
um
"annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the information and they don't want to take it, they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt"
"It's sad and then they want to come to you and you're like ugh, I tried to tell you, but you can't be mad at them because everyone learns their own way so"
mm
"Yeah, I guess for a while, when you think about it, uh, when you see them go through their fights, it's hard to watch"
"but it is a necessary movement of life children must learn how they want to learn, because as soon as they get it they will have it the same way, however they get it"
You as a parent are glad they have it.
All the love the children give you
"yeah she loves <lo> you know love you and especially my daughter, who she always wants to give me hugs"
she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me I do a great job when I'm like < laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but
They know that they have this unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for
that the children tell you that you're a good person.
I like that.
hmm
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,"
ooh <sigh> You know it as if Albert Einstein said it best that our technology has surpassed our humanity.
"And there's so much technology out there that kids learn so fast that it's almost like they're little adults, but..."
"They miss the steps to being a child, they miss going outside, they miss learning about things naturally, rather than just going to youtube or"
They know where always Facebook and get it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information
and they just have to fight through all this information and they're not growing up organic kids these days it's not organic it's puffed up it's pushed
"and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world, so that's what's wrong"
hmm
me <Laughter> just breathe in and breathe out or I'll just walk away from the situation
argued
I had a fight with my fiancée a few months ago.
God I forgot I forgot I don't remember
It was petty.
"Yeah, but it didn't take long, because she's like me, that she doesn't like discussing things that we like to care about when it happens and that's it."
hmm

"as close as possible with the distance and certain decisions that my family have made over the years, you know, far away and"
"But my immediate family like you knows my fiancée and my daughter, like we're close and it's great."
< slaughter>
"I don't travel enough, but I've traveled a few times uh within the last five years I just came out of new zeal and so that was a great experience"
"Yeah, that's good."
"I enjoy meeting new people who are the biggest in travel, I like to see new things that I like to immerse myself in different cultures and situations and I like"
"Just being away from her, that's good too."
"Well, I went to new zeal and uh not too long ago and I had <ha>"
"I've been learning about Celsius for a week because you know, here we have Fahrenheit and that was fun, uh, I learned how to play cricket"

Scrubbed_entry
had this bag M and M's and we had gone to a game
"And there were two girls who were a few rows down that you know we weren't particularly interested, but you know that's what kids are like, just that they don't know how you know they don't like anybody, but you know,"
"Anyway, we got this m and m's and while it was dark, we started to throw m and m's and hit them in the head with the m's and m's and then we came to school like three days later we were called and there was a sham process"
to get
Scrubbed_entry
so we could free ourselves from it as if the whole group of the crime did not make us guilty
"And then we got into trouble anyway, because our teacher just didn't want to allow us to get into trouble, so we had to clean up the farm for two days."
"Oh man you call it uh I love diving I've only done it twice, but I love it wants to go back into it like traveling"

not
go to Will Schmied when I had the chance
Yeah uh wants blacksmith came up the street and I saw him and I got so nervous I jumped into the bushes and
"I haven't met him yet. My boss thought it was funny, but I wasn't ready to meet him yet, but I think I regret meeting him."
Advice I would give myself ten or twenty years ago
"I would probably say that if my stomach told me to do something, I just kept doing it and did it instead of sitting and analyzing it you know days weeks months later, if I feel it in my stomach I should go for it with my stomach more"
Really Happy
hmm
"really happy I had a film festival that I put together and things were so intense that we went wrong, but then it went right, but then people came and grabbed the house"
"I was really glad we had a packed house at this uh film festival, so that was about a month ago."
"Yeah, that's good."
"<sigh> let's see, I think now at this point I'm very proud to have a short film along with a minimal budget, but it has amazing actors it has a great plot line and"
"I didn't think it could be done, but it's done or done nearby, and I'm proud that I was able to get it done I think I could go happy to know that I gave it a really good"
shot and I think this movie will bring me and the rest of my movie crew friends to higher heights
"Oh, really."
