value
Yes
pretty good
I grew up in Boston
About thirty years ago
yep
not too often
Maybe once a year sometimes less
"Oh, I love living in l_a, I never want to live anywhere else"
"Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and"
the weather was good and
That's part of it.
very simple
good maybe something easy the beginning of the first few weeks was really hard
"just being in a new environment and being away from everyone I knew, but after a few weeks it was great"
Radio journalism
"Well, it's something I've wanted to do since I was 12."
and all I did from the time I was twelve until I went to college was somehow in pursuit of this dream
No <Laughter>
"Well, it's kind of a long story, but I was fired from my first job when I was"
"in my twenties, and"
It's just
"Once I had done this work, I realized that this is not really what I wanted to do, it was also"
"It just wasn't suitable for me, it didn't make me happy."
yep < sigh>
my dream job works with football players and helps them to recover from concussion and other injuries
<deep breath> good the work itself is not very hard I'm very good at what I do the hard part is to find the right people and work the connections with them
it
I'm not so much on the road anymore.
I love to see different places and different things like I love to go to places that don't like
where I come from
my favorite trip is that I was in Australia for my thirtieth birthday.
Because I wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday when I crossed the international date limit.
and I went to this really small place on the
"Uh West Coast of Australia called Shark Bay, where native dolphins live and swim"
and is for the most part very isolated and I have to be there for a whole week and only really a lot of myself
with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you
and it's amazing just a beautiful place in the world
more shy <sigh>
< deep breath> why < sigh> hm that's a good question around
The first thing I think about is because I've always been like this.
But maybe that's an excuse I don't know.
I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than many people
So [sighing]
I'm looking at a lot of t_v <sigh>
"or that's probably not the best alternative, but it's something I do"
"and I also go to the beach because I live near the beach, so that's one of my favorite things to relax"

"it depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good"
"I don't think I tend to argue with people, I think I just get angry about situations"
but not in humans directly <sigh>
I don't know if I'm feeling guilty about anything right now.
I don't know if I have one right now.
<deep breath> Sounds of other people's noise make me really angry
I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and disgusting.
not considerate
about her neighbors that makes me really crazy
"Yeah, look at me."
hmm <sigh>
"Well, the only one that comes to mind from the top of my head is when I bought my apartment"
it felt like a really hard decision at the time
"You know, I didn't know I could do it, I wasn't sure if I had the money to do it."
"So that felt like a really difficult decision, but in hindsight of course it proved to be a big decision"
but at the time it was really difficult to do that
pretty easy I sleep pretty well <sigh>
<deep breath> mostly good I'm just really worried about money at the moment so that's my biggest so I can't say I'm how big
"But I'm worried, but you know I'm confident it'll work."
No <sigh>
Yes
hmm <sigh>
I don't know I can't remember.
"I mean, I don't feel"
"super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either somehow like just uh"
even
Kiel
"Well, I have to go to the..."
my friends work at the Film Academy so I can see all xxx oscar-nominated films
Scrubbed_entry
"She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and"
"to see them again, so that was very pleasant <sigh>"

Loyal < sigh>
and
considerate and considerate
I've been working really hard on it.
I think
"There are many things I might do differently, but there's nothing I really regret"
um
"Well, I think there are things."
the
To <sigh>
as if it wasn't worth wasting the energy
Thinking about things I regret
so I didn't regret much xxx about things
"♪ Deep breath ♪ Oh, that's a good question ♪ ♪ Sigh ♪ ♪ Don't worry about that little stuff ♪"
and save more money <Laughter>
For example:
"Well, there are, uh, you know, normal things like I'd lose more weight and I'd like to"
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
think a little more fearless maybe <sigh>
be a little braver
I don't think I have them.
"I'm self-employed, so I'm working all the time <Laughter> so my ideal weekend is to have a lot of customers."
um
this is something I enjoy
um
so that would be ideal at this point my weekends if I were really busy
<deep breath> that I was really able to take care of myself and that
You know I did pretty much everything I said I wanted to do.
I did this.
and I don't and I have no regrets about things there's nothing really that
eh
is unfeeling undone
Surely in my life there are many things I still want to do
"Um, but..."
I feel like I did what I said.
"Yeah, that's not so great, it's okay, my parents both died, and I have a sister and a brother."
um
"I feel closer to my brother than to my sister, but..."
they both live on the east coast and I live in l_a
and then I have my sister has two girls
"So I feel very close to my nieces, even though we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers."
they have other things in mind
<deep breath> to probably my teacher
a person from whom I have learned my holistic bodywork
"I really like it, <sigh>"
model my work and my way of being after him
as if he were a good example
for me the way he keeps his work and how he lives his life
"We're pretty close, we don't know the best friends, but I know I can call him anytime I need him."
around <sigh> put me in a good mood <sigh>
usually with my friends or go to dinner
or by < sigh>
"Yeah, I'm just spending time with my friends"
All right.
Thank you <sigh>
See you.
