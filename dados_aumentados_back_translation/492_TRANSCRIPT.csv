I know.
Tend to some shyness from time to time
mhm

"Well, I had an argument recently not really an argument, but a disagreement"
with a woman in my church who
It's over
this special department in which I am
and it's a voluntary position uh
I use my uh administration assistant to get more executive assistant skills
to uh
to uh
I make minutes for meetings I cover
and around and then I have to produce the minutes and send them to all and such things.
and this person...
"is micromanaging me uh, but not micromanaging the other"
Uh admin assistant who
did not get their block of people in this special meeting
So the meeting should have been made up of a hundred people.
but we had maybe thirty no was not even thirty twenty
Yes <Laughter> around
Now she doesn't know that I realize that you know this part of it.
"So, um..."
"there was a little argument and uh again no argument, but a difference of opinion"
And when we talk again I will
points out the person who is above both of us that there is a separation
and the energy it invests
in me is unprofitable
for what we are trying to achieve
doesn't sound good <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
"Well, a little attacked"
you know
so
it depends on me being very good in controlling my temperament
it's uh you know there are places where you can
Allow your temper to come out
Even if it may not be appropriate and then there are other places where when it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot
So uh I'm pretty good at controlling my temperament
"Yeah, that's good."
um
I don't have a situation.
"The other day, I can think of"
likely to say
um
I'm just dealing with a neighbor.
"I answer the neighbor and ignore the neighbor, so I wish I'd done something different."
"Yeah, that's good."
hmm
Thankfully
I didn't have to make that kind of decision.
in my life still
mhm
hmm
um
mm
I've...
what I do in my life and you know in my
You know how to keep going.
everything that
I've done everything that's happened.
i
to accept it as something that
must be:
to get me to move forward
Uh I'm a reborn Christian and so I know that
that God is sovereign over my life
uh and also according to his word
the Bible says that every day of our lives is written in his book
So events and circumstances
um
I feel that I feel that she is ordained by God now obviously I am not too
In order to enter a
Burn fire or do something ridiculous
But...
"I feel that things that had happened had happened, even if I treated them in the wrong way."
It's God's.
be sovereignty < s>
"Total sovereignty has control over it, and it will work for my good"
So that's how I feel
um
I have all the brothers
And so I'm not really that close to my brothers
and my mother
Say that again.
People I grew up with.
Neighbors off when I have

I was about to.
"Um, um..."

uh
Weaknesses better than my strengths

the other chips fall where they can
but doing what I know to do is right
