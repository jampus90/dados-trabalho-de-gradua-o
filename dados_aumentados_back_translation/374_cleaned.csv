mhm
I moved to I_a.
End of two thousand one
"Yes, it's crazy <Laughter>"
um
a few times a year usually like for holidays
It's very different.
I think it's much softer
"Um, it's much more like suburban."
It's nice.
"there's something comforting about it, but it's always like I'm getting a little restless when I'm there and looking forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>"
I went to college in U_s_c.
"It wasn't bad, I mean my program that I was in."
was so intense that
as for the first year
"it was all consumed so that I really didn't have much free time to think about the adjustment, it was just like I was <Laughter> my life wasn't my own so"
That did it somehow
to easier I appreciate and also I was like in a community of people I knew with so automatically I knew people and you know friends and so
It wasn't bad.
Film
"One day I had a revelation, I was no longer undergraded."
I was kind of a little flundering I didn't really know what I wanted to do
and
just one day I was kind of like you know what I'm really excited about what I'm really passionate about
and
"I realized that movies are the thing I love the most and I'm most passionate about it, so I decided to go to film school."
"a little yes and no it's not me I'm so <s> I'm like in a little transition at the moment, but yeah as in recent years I've produced uh like freelance producer <sniffle>"
So this is the question of the moment <laughter> around
I think that uh
"I don't necessarily have a job title that's my dream job, but I know it's kind of"
What's that?
"I want and because basically as I live a freelance lifestyle for a while and I know this is how exhausting and I don't want to do that anymore, so I'm looking for something that's stable"
"You know, full time"
nice benefits and I definitely want to stay in the entertainment industry
um
and I like to know what I love about producing is that it's just like there are constant challenges and you don't know anything about it.
"what will be thrown at you that I, that you know that it is always interesting and exciting"
So I'm trying to figure out what a good one would be right now.
To be a place for me where I can reasonably be challenged and you know have a kind of
as space to grow and advance and all this
"Yeah, that's good."
I can't see your shoes.
I like to travel around
"I don't know that I haven't done much lately, but I've known you in the past,"
a fair amount paid
um
I love the adventure of only you know new experiences new places new people
"I think it's just good to get out of your little island world and see what's out there, and you just know it."
see
Beautifully remarkable
Places and things and simply experience different ways of life and different languages and cultures <sniffle>
um
"Let's see, I went to Costarica a few years ago."
um
my best friend from growing up she and I went for like ten days and it was likely that
this could be like my
"Favorite trip of all time <Laughter> as if it was really awesome, but <Laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful"
um
and we just spent like
"we went to three different places and to explore just a lot and how sightseeing we walked a ton, which was amazing"
"and then like the last place we landed was this little beach town, so it was at this point as if we felt like you know that we had done all this like amazing physical effort, like Ziplines and all these walks, so that when we came to the beach, it was like"
We deserve the right to step back and relax.
It hit everyone from the
You know it as fed this kind of desire for adventure and activity around but it also
I'm also a great fan of vacation where you just like veg out and relax and how to lie on a beach with a book so it somehow hit everything
What do I do to relax?
"I mean, depending on where I am, like when it is, you know if I'm like at work or something, and I'm stressed out, I'm just gonna..."
you know
take a minute and breathe just like really deep and try to calm me down
um
"When I'm home, I might like it."
you know
throw on a movie or like a t_v show that I really like and only that gives a feeling of how
Type of escape relief
"Pretty good, I don't mean"
"It takes a lot to make me very angry, it doesn't happen very often."
um
"The last time I had a fight with someone, my mother was <Laughter> and it was about money <Laughter> <Depth Breath>"
um
I felt really frustrated because I felt like she was
how to judge me unjustly
and that was disturbing
Yes <Laughter>
um
"It's good, uh you know they live all over the country from me so I don't see them often, but as I usually talk to"
my mom on the phone probably like once in the week and
my parents are really supportive <sigh> around
they are
You know how when I go home to see how I enjoy I enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time
So I'd say we have a pretty
Pretty good relationship
I guess because I'm like that.
Type of work Hunting
Phase I feel guilty sometimes that I don't like
do enough you know how there are times when there are like days where maybe like I should have
sent a few more summaries or more things as I feel guilty sometimes for not how productive enough <sniffle>
Usually it's pretty easy the last few weeks as was atypical as not as good
I'm not sure I haven't figured it out yet.
But I just had more
uh
"like nights, in which"
either
takes me a really long time to go to sleep or I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason
um
"I also have a lot like really strange intense dreams that wake up like me sometimes I wake up myself sometimes <laughter> because I'm talking, which is weird <laughter> the so yes, it's just I don't know"
not that I was able to identify
"I mean, I think maybe I'm more stressed than usual just because I'm doing my job situation like"
"in the river, but"
I don't know that there was no similar event.
"I appreciate good sleep, and I'm used to it, so it's just not good."
Feeling
um
not really no
Yes
To <sigh>
as < sigh>
I think in how
October or November
"Although this is actually the second time that it happened in my life, but the first time was like"
many years ago <sniffle>
um
I felt like I was
a really low and how too low for me to free me from
To <sigh>
just a hard time
Work on the most fundamental
Level as only
Get up and
in a shower
and go to the grocery store
And you know
Answering e-mails was just like
It took so much energy
um
"So yeah, I just wasn't really"
Normal working
"Yeah, that's good."
Yes
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"<Laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall I would say, so"
< deep breath> I think that the therapy
is good for me because it
helps me to open up
my kind of patterns...
and also like
ah
"just how to observe how I am like reaction to certain situations and just think it's < deep breath> it gives me a more elevated like kind of self-consciousness around, so that unlike just like"
um
Kind of just react to situations I'm like
mm
just as if I noticed more what's going on around
"and it just helps,"
um
I don't know it's just helpful <Laughter> I don't really know <real> I don't really know how to explain it <Laughter>

I can't think of <Laughter> I can't think of anything <sharp inhale>
"Oh, maybe about uh"
about Christmas at home with my family
"Yeah, that's good."
um
"Well, it was just"
It was like I just started getting out of my depression.
and
"as you know, I live alone here I have a dog, but so I only had a long time of"
Feeling
not
<Laughter> Great and easy to do everything alone and somehow wish my family was around me
um
"So, when I was with them, it was just..."
It just felt very much like
safe and comfortable and just as you know it
warm family hug
To <sigh>
<Laughter> I think she'd call me
funny
and smart
and
um
a good listener
Not legally binding
um
I don't know that <Laughter> enough <Laughter>
All right.
so
this happened
the last like
"Job I had I mean I was it wasn't technical I was a freelancer, but I worked for this company for how"
one and a half years almost two years and uh
"I had a very small company, the boss had a really good relationship with my boss, and he's kind of pissed off."
he's kind of out of nowhere
uh
mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and around
essentially as
the agreement we had is that he would pay me like a monthly holder for my services and then I would get paid fees per project
"So he liked to put me on this conversation and was like you know our big customer who's like you know the bread and butter of the company that they really cut back, as you probably notice that things are getting really slow and I was like yeah"
And he's like I'm gonna stop paying you for your hold.
"and that was a total surprise, but I was fine and he went on to talk like"
he
I would still have the right to the first rejection of all the projects that came through the door and you know because that he seemed like you know
Even if I didn't get the Retainer anymore
"He would still throw me enough work, as if I didn't know it wasn't like a drama."
Decline in the amount of money I made <Cough> excuse me
"But um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work that I love to work with you, you're fantastic"
yada yada so
"To make a long story short, what happened then, that he fired me."
"Um, and he was his way of pushing me out of the company and letting me go because from then on,"
"he stopped calling me, he stopped e-mailing me."
and later like a few months down the street
I had to go back to the office because there were some projects that still
"running like the customer took a really long time to get back with their notes and when I was there, I saw that around"
This guy who
had worked with us a number of similar
"If we needed another producer, like if we were beaten, we would get him to do something else."
He did my job like that.
"Yeah, so it's just like"
It was a real <rea> <laughter> it was a really crappy way of getting fired without being told that I was fired around and it was just like
that uh the reason I want if I could erase that is out of my mind because I don't really think of another situation that makes me feel as angry and frustrated and just like
in a way that
"that, although this was as you know a few months ago, feels very unresolved and makes me somehow like"
"angry when I think about it, so yeah that was a very long explanation, but that's what I want <Laughter>"

i um
a very loyal person <deep breath> around
I'm
smart I am organized i < deep breath> around
very like caring kind
um
I'm conscientious.
and I work hard <sniffle>
<Laughter> uh
Man
I think
to uh
Be More Confident
and
Less passive
um
to really
Focus on
what I want and the things I know will make me happy and just go out and get them instead of sitting back and waiting for opportunities to imagine
hmm <sigh> um
probably just a few of the
Relationships I Formed With People
um
Just like really
you know deep friendships
You're welcome.
See you.
