value
Yes
I'm fine.
I'm from Greenwich Connecticut
Yes
I moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago
"I try to go back at least once a year, sometimes I go more times less"
Overall I think I like where I'm out better than l_a in general
um
I think that
"other than being somewhere, I'm familiar with the kind of people that are there"
are just more my
guy and what I'm used to and
It's less superficial.
"I moved here after my high school degree, and my mother and sister live in California."
At first it was easy because I felt like
"it was a new experience, so you somehow adapt and just"
"experience everything at once, but then after the first years, when it really"
how different it is and
"what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally"
uh Visual Art and Photography
I was interested in photography since high school around I have a lot of programs and
receive awards and such things and publications
so I decided to pursue art
"Um, yeah, I got a degree in fine arts that I got last year and"
Scrubbed_entry
"Yeah, I really enjoy working in forensics or intervening."
"I like this better than at first, what I wanted to do was freelance photography"
I feel it's a safe job and it's very interesting
um
That's an interesting question.
I think just my childhood in general
growing up
"Well, my family is very close."
um
also my extended family and they all live <li>most of them live
within the area or on the east coast in general so we would always great family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that
"yes, it's really fun and we try and all together as much as possible, that's"
more difficult now that everyone is distributed among different countries and countries
I think I'm more shy.
um
i
Seeing reality TV I find it kind of funny and lighthearted
around I look like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and
like funny things you don't really have to pay attention to
um
"I'm good, I guess I don't really have a temper when I"
when I stressed more it definitely shows up in my attitude it but I didn't really like anger
um
"Well, me and my friend like Bicker <Laughter> all the time just like"
Insignificant things
but different from the
I had a fight with my dad a few days ago.
um
There was some kind of tension going on.
then I went and visited over the holidays in this last winter
Things about his girlfriend and
He thinks I should be the one trying to
have a relationship with her although he does not think for any reason that it should go both ways
so for the thirtieth time that he
We were on the phone and he was
"I told myself how to call her and talk to her, and I told him I would do it last weekend because of the Jewish holidays and"
he was very mature and told me oh forget she doesn't want to hear from you now and somehow like I might be less interested because i
"I don't care about having a relationship with her, so if she doesn't want to hear from me, you know it's easier for me."
um
"I mean, every time when <t> I mean, it was the same recurring argument a lot and I wish,"
"that I could do sometimes, but I wish that the times it turns into an explosive fight, that I could just bite into my tongue"
"But the thing is, he says,"
certain things that are not true
or things he knows how will tick me
"who are really mean, and"
"that he shouldn't say to me, so"
So I kind of lose it and I can't really
Mm like nothing to say
um
"Well, I guess the toughest decision I've made that I don't"
I just realized that it's the hardest decision to look back when you decide where you
After graduating from high school where you go to college because for me I basically
changed my whole life and moved away and did all this alone
"so it didn't seem so difficult to make a decision at the time it felt like a progress of the next step, but now looking back"
this is probably one of the most difficult decisions I've made
um
"Well, I wish I could erase"
the event or the sight
"my grandmother's funeral,"
"Obviously, it wouldn't change anything."
but
It wasn't
Seeing her wasn't something I wanted
how to have in my memory
around her she was a very positive influence and always
was not judging
um
and now I mean my parents are great role models just in general I mean they are very successful people
"So whether or not we have differences of opinion, that we are separate people"
they are good role models in terms of what you want to have if you
are older
Usually it's easy to stay the problem aseep
"No matter how late I go to bed, whether it's ten p_m or four a_m"
I'll be up like clockwork
At seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and I can't seem to
Find out why I can't sleep anymore
"No, I'm just..."
"In the morning I'm probably a lighter sleeper, but I just wake up as if I just couldn't stay asleep anymore, which was never a problem that was so consistent, but now it's"
I can't remember the last time I slept the morning after eight thirty.
"I mean, it's easy when I have to do things during the day, it makes it a lot more strenuous."
but it's not really I'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday life
um
"I don't know, I feel kind of very"
mm
like that
only
no extreme highs no extreme lows it is somehow
a note country
I mean nothing like lately
um
as recently it is just I would say over a period of years I have a kind of gradually settled more and more
reserved only; and
not very outgoing
no
no I was diagnosed with fear
I had a few breathing problems for a day or two and had to go to the hospital.
"Because I thought it was more serious because I couldn't breathe, but"
They said it was a physical manifestation of my fear
I think in the right environment and
with the person who does it when they are open-minded and the therapist
is helpful
"And good in what they do, then yeah"
"No, I haven't been in therapy since I was a kid."
I left because my parents thought it was a good idea to like
to deal with all the problems they had with me
But it was never I mean we just sat around talking about my day
It wasn't
"I don't feel like I needed therapy back then, so I didn't really get much of it."
"Well, I was happy when I was home with his family at my friend's house for the new year."
"when I'm there, I can only"
We save our money so it's a complete vacation I don't have to
"Paying worrying about bills I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with every morning, we wake up and hang out."
Just enjoy the day
in general
um
"I regret the college I chose to go, I didn't"
"From the east coast, the entire collegiate system is very different and"
universities are not the same as the tightly knit Californian school system out here
"So, when I was researching colleges, I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College at home, or"
You know every other school called College at the end of that I didn't realize until you knew the end of my first year.
that it was more like a transfer school like you
You can't even know you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I left.
so it kind of creates more problems for me
"Well, considering I'm twenty-two, I'd probably say ten years ago."
"I'd give myself the advice,"
Probably stay near home
and to have
"really pursued other options, rather than just being fully invested in moving to California"
um
my best friend would describe me
as great charismatic funny ending
socially enjoyable person who is different from how
People who are not my good friends would describe me
What I mean I don't mean I mean it's what it is I
I am very outgoing and have a great time when I am with my friends in my element but around strangers and in how unpleasant groups and things I just
I am very shy and
Not really.
Speak a lot
Recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clipper basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that
"Yeah, that's good."
um
I'm very caring.
i
I am a very good judge of character
what I mean I think I mean I consider it a quality < qu> quality for myself
um
I am very loving <aff>
"I mean,"
"I'm not very tender, I'm more"
"I mean, I guess I guess so"
Thank you.
