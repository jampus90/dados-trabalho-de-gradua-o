value
Yes
"I'm fine, it's still tomorrow, so..."
I'm from the east coast of Massachusetts
Yes
"I moved to l_a when I was a child with my parents, pretty much had no choice in the matter <Laughter>"
"I wasn't there the last time I was there, three years ago for Christmas."
um
"It's very hectic, there are a lot of people who are angry."
and many people are not interested in the other person here in l_a
in which in the east of the east coast the thought pattern is much different you know your neighbors you are friendly to your neighbors and to everyone you see on the road

"Yeah, that's good."
"Well, since I was a kid, I was pretty young at first it was hard I was in trouble a little at school"
But...
after all that surpassed I was <wa> I did well in high shcool and so and even took some college courses
um
"Well, I love the beach"
and I love the mountains I like to walk
"Um and I like walking along the beach I live only a few blocks away from the beach, so it's easy"
no
Not at all
just not interested uh I was on mexico a few times when I was younger
"went to Ensenada, but except that I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what has happened lately"
To go abroad
around <Laughter> actually child psychology and I was in the care program for a little
"but I had some problems at home, which caused me to get out"
"Oh, that's all right."
(a) the value of the goods in question shall be equal to or less than the value of the goods in question;
um
I don't have any.
to be honest around
"I admire people who do the job they love, I mean like football players who like to play football, and they get all the money paid, how big is that <Laughter>"
so
I'm pretty intrusive when I meet someone first.
"To say, if we want to"
continue to communicate with the person or not
and once I have decided that I like this person or whatever I talk a lot
so
Yes
um
I like watching movies
"I like reading, but lately my concentration wasn't that big, so it's hard to get into a good book"
not good in times I uh I have a
some breakout every time in a while so anyway it depends on how angry I get
Yesterday
and it was with my partner
and
"To be honest, I don't know what it was anymore, it's just"
Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and I don't appreciate it and when I feel that I'm disrespectful or whatever I'm going to stand up for myself
so
um
"Sometimes some people can be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and I say what I am, what is in my mind"
I don't know.
deliberately go and hurt people's feelings or anything of this nature
but
I'm not being bullied and I'm not being made to not return when I feel like I'm being challenged
so
um
My mother died last year.
so
I wish I could've done it differently.
um
It stirs up <ups> it upsets me
so
It's okay.
Let me see.
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
"I think I'm going to pass this on, too, because it's getting me more upset, so <Laughter>"
"that's sometimes awful uh sometimes actually falling asleep can be no problem, especially you know when you're done working and doing everything you had to do in a day, you're tired"
"But staying asleep is a completely different thing for me, because"
It's like I can't uh
I get up and then I'm awake I'm going to the living room turn the t_v and watch t_v I'm lucky when I sleep three to four hours
Maybe because I have a lot in my mind.
"uh you know, think about bills and"
and
"the stressiness of the work and then all the other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it"
"It's not hard, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes to overtime mode"
it just affects everything your concentration your sleep your food
Everything like this
I'm a little grouchy especially in the morning I'm not a morning man <Laughter>
"I like the nights, but I don't like the morning, it's like leaving me alone until I get my first cup of coffee"
"Yeah, that's good."
so different from the
I'm
I'm fine.
"Well, I was depressed."
for some time
and I still have difficulties <diff> difficulty
Because after my mother's death four months later my uncle died
"So I've had two deaths last year, so I'm still wavering and trying to"
"to get back together, I'm just recently I've started to pursue like interests that I used to do"
that I haven't done in a year because of what happened
"Um, I'm just..."
I could get angry a little easier I sleep a lot I eat too much I eat too much
um
I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep
"so sometimes it's hard, it seems like I'm fighting to get through the day"
"Yes, I have a psychiatrist who prescribes me medication on a regular basis."
oh I was diagnosed some time ago hm probably
Ten to fifteen years ago
and it's just something I never have
I don't know if or not
"You can, so I've always taken the medicine."
um
I was
fight with each of my family my friends and so and me
was desperate and hopeless
and I had tried to take my own life years ago
What took me to the hospital
And then uh
"They started treating me, I started seeing a therapist"
so
"Well, right now, I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance covers the psychiatrist and not the therapist."
but I work with a friend of mine who <ha>
Ways to go to seek help for a therapist and I don't know if this will really help me
I mean at some point it depends on what kind of therapist you sometimes just sit people there
"And they just listen to you when you talk and go on and you think, my God, what's good is that?"
and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback
how to deal with emotions
Tools to help you deal with your emotions
so
um
"as I said, I didn't go to therapy recently just psychiatrists just medications"
um
There were no real changes.
"I would probably do well because I did well before my mother died, I was her nurse"
and uh
even if many times i
I felt overwhelmed or
missing <l> uh missing patience with her
uh
I was still much happier.
when I am now
so
um
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
I'd say when my son was born years ago
"I'm not a parent anymore, he died."
so
um
and that was also difficult
uh
hmm
around I am extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me
"Because I get everything done that I should be done, although sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained"
and
"You know, these qualities are admirable in people who can keep their word and be responsible"
Excuse me.
"Oh, I have a lot of regret for"
Things I've done in the past that I'm not too happy about
But you know I met someone once in my life.
that had this saying and you see it on a bumper sticker
uh
live to never regret
"So you know you can't go back and make changes, it's too late, so why you know you have the situation."
but sometimes it's a lot easier said than done
To I'm not the advice somehow getting person <Laughter> I know I don't really know
give my friends every advice I can
"I find most of the times people don't listen to you, so why bother"
um
"I'm just saying my opinion, that's all."
I'm on a diet because I ate too much.
"After my mother died, I was much thinner than she was alive."
I just went crazy with the food and a lot of sleeping
You know that sleep eat sleep eat
"and now I'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight, because it's very unhealthy for me"
um
hmm
I'm trying to believe it's been a long time.
"Actually, there's nothing, because"
Now I just keep my thoughts busy
"I haven't been in a movie in ages, I haven't gone shopping all the time."
um
So it's been a long time since it's been so long.
I was content and happy with who I am and what I do in my life.
around my weekends Saturday <sa> uh like Saturday I usually work
around Sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house
um
running some errands going shopping for food
You know that.
so
"It's not that if I was younger, you know, it would be fun to do clubbing or whatever, but I'm too old for it now."
xxx
um
There's nothing I can imagine.
there's nothing I can be proud of
hmm
um
some a good like comedy or whatever I like to see that around
sometimes my partner could do something stupid I like
'Cause I like to make fun of him
um
"But mm only that's what you know, go maybe go for a walk on the beach, that's it"
All right.
"No problem, thank you."
See you.
