Sometimes it's hard for me to express my own thoughts
"Well, you mentioned a fish tank and uh"

not as I would have liked to have treated.
guess the toughest decision was just before
of
how to
Continue with
Further development
a
Employment opportunities
I had to
decide whether or not to:
if I would
suffer more emotional pain by leaving
my family and whether the financial gain and
Knowledge
This experience would outweigh the benefits
yes yes yes yes I am
"Well, it's a small family, but..."
have a mother and a
Uh sister and a brother
and two younger nieces
older they are adult adults
It's a good relationship.
and
uh
things could be better
Sometimes it's a kind of difficult pain.
Scatching
Uh relationship sometimes
There are a few days when I
I need time for myself and i
would rather give the time to
other people instead of taking time for me what my experience was
"Uh, and so on."
This has caused me very emotional
Pain uh a little spiritual
Uh fear for my future if I keep doing something like this
wow there are so many things <Laughter> what about you I know nothing about you
I'd say there's some...
but of the most recent
All right.
"Things are going pretty well, I'm"
can't really say that there's something else I can really change or regret that I can remember
It was pretty good.

I suppose it made me a more confident person and more
um
in accordance with Uh
the land in which I live and the people
uh
to be more noticeable watch where I live
to hang out with some friends uh
on a really nice weekend and uh on a boat
uh or on a skiff a really small boat and around
