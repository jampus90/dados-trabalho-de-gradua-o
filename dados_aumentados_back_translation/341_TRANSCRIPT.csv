The hardest part is...
Raising a child with a disability
You don't know how to help him.
It's very hard
I don't paint it.
I only have my children.
"You are a blessing I love, <Laughter>"
with all the good and the bad it's a part of me and I just love the fact that I'm helping her in shape
good people <Laughter>
We're really close.
"I mean, my family is small, we live in blocks of each other, but yes, we're close."
Good or bad

Most memorable
just the birth for the first time it was just amazing
"My son's nine now, so I remember how it was yesterday."
< slaughter>
how I was
being born again I don't know how to explain it just very much
Emotional <Laughter>
"I don't know <Laughter> I guess I have a lot of regret, but"
none I really want to mention I guess <Laughter>
stay in school <Laughter> do not interfere emotionally
and to leave the people
deter you from your goals <Laughter>
"Oh, yeah, that's it."
Definitely
Did you want to move on?
"I'm all right, I mean, I'm pretty loose."
for the most part I don't really have a temperament in itself
Things frustrate me more than they annoy me

"Oh, that's just <laughter> with my mother she's like"
"I guess the argument came from me wanting,"
Socialize <Laughter> she feels that
"I'm married to children, so I should stay home"
like ninety-nine percent of the time
And I wanted to go out and join some ex-colleagues
and they
in principle
"kind of let me down for it, like I'm not spending enough time with my kids <Laughter>"
it shall:
And I love my mother I hate even the thoughts of being frustrated with her
Because I always think I don't want to get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day
but
She's getting kind of intrusive <Laughter> I don't know <Laughter>
oh I know about ending after the semester when I noticed that i
"You know I was good at school because it's been a long time since I went to school, so..."
when I got my grades you know a and a b I was like wow okay I can do this and it made me happy
and that was about
a couple of weeks ago I guess mhm
Thank you.
My mother I know it's good and bad <Laughter> I mean for the most part my mother was a positive influence you know it's only sometimes
you know she's getting a little
"as she wants to raise me up again or something like that she doesn't understand that I'm an adult, I'm going to make my own decisions now and"
Pretty much have to let me do what I have to do
< sigh>a quantity
"Heavy breathing <Laughter> I mean, I go sometimes when I get a lil' frustrated, whatever I'm just going to take a walk"
You just don't know or try to think about it.
Thank you very much <Laughter>
Yes
Yes
the Navy
I was 19 years old.
"Yeah, that's good."
<Laughter> yeah
I had no other options.
< slaughter>
"I'm probably supposed to stay in a lil' longer I was only in for four years, but"
"You know I wanted to experience life outside the military, so I did my job."
enlistment and then I got out
It made me a little more responsible than some of my friends who know you can't join the military I can make a big difference as far as you know how I live my life and how they live their lives
Just to make me a little more responsible
Thank you very much <Laughter>
I worked in the medical field for about five years
and uh
"Oh, thank you."
"But it wasn't for me I wanted to do something lil'bit differently I didn't want patient care I wanted to work with people, but not necessarily as patient care"
This is the case for suppliers.
"I started going to school and then I met my husband, I stopped going to school."
married and I started working in an area of telecommunications
and then you know that we have begotten our child and after
You know <Laughter>
< slaughter>
I think I take good care of myself I know I'm very caring you know I'm very honest to a mistake sometimes you know that I'm trying to
be as honest as possible with people
"Sometimes it can hurt their feelings, but you know you have to be honest, you can't let people"
"think that you know,"
you do not trust
and when
Mm yeah probably I haven't really thought about it
I don't know.
< slaughter>
"Maybe I'm not really thinking about it, I'm just trying to be the best person I can be"
You know that.
"everything I can do, I can't live for what other people think, I can only do what I need to do <Laughter>"
um
I don't know.
<Laughter> I've never really thought about it
I guess it's just you know to be my kids you know I love to be around my kids
And that always puts me in a good mood <Laughter>
Thank you.
"Okay, like I said, a lil' tired you know, but"
"You know for the most part, okay, you know that I'm dealing with situations that"
"Well, I'm really going to bed early, so..."
"As long as I go to bed early, I get a good night's sleep, but I wake up early."
<Laughter> it's kind of like
good and bad a little I go to bed like eight eight thirty and then I wake up like a thirty
so
< slaughter>
very moody
very irritable short short-tempered I guess
"if something I think, I think more positive"
"You know, like I said, especially with my son with a disability, you know, I look at it like you know,"
It's not all bad
"I mean, he's got challenges, but I'm much better at dealing with them."
"You know, unlike pity for him or pity for me, you know I find more ways to work with him."
"various resources to help him, unlike just guilt or sad and depressed about it"
Thank you.
no
uncommon
Who does not <Laughter>
I don't know that we can skip this question.
< slaughter>
<sigh> green <laughter> the word seems to be somehow like around
