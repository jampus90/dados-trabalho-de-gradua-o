"very simple very easy, just as you know, you can find it to your nine to five job to pay the rent and xxx many things to do here"

I fit in really well
hmm
This is a
"Wow what uh oh eh good just like that probably the homeless problem, but you need to see uh"
"The lunatics and they eat out of the trash, and you know we're the homeless capital of America, and you need to see this everywhere."
"Yeah, that's good."

I just graduated high school
"but I have an interest in writing you know,"
"Yeah, that's good."
uh no I have an interest in reading and words and creating stories and being imaginative and yeah
"but I haven't written anything in oh for a while, but it's my drug that I don't drink or smoke or do any of the types of drugs, but uh writing was always what made me high"
"Yeah, but I wasn't inspired."
but I recently met a young girl who is a stand-up and her routine is so interesting that I could write a novel of her routine
In any case <Laughter>
Oh <Laughter> I don't know why <Laughter> actually Facebook told us all this stuff about how she's friends with a homeless woman and the homeless can earn xxx four <fo> can inherit four million dollars when she comes off the street
"and she has an autistic sister who is very strange but crazy about guys and and and she's like twenty and wants to be a comic and she's really talented, I made her Facebook and but she didn't answer"

Probably <probab> yes yes yes
I try to think <th> what introverted means that you know I'm good I keep everything in me probably and I'm yes and then I always think probably all the time yes
think about my problems and only
Too much analysis
"Yeah, that's good."
"Probably lazy people who just live off the government, and you know they're getting their section eight, they just don't go out and work and fight for themselves, and you know you're taking care of yourself."
makes me crazy people <peop> just people who just know so lazy you and they and some who go they go or they're in the traffic with their signs give me money please help me please help me just <ju> help yourself help me
That makes me angry.
"I'm just trying to deal with it and I'm just trying to try because I don't like being angry or angry, I don't really curse so much that I'm just trying to stay smart, so I'm just trying to deal with it and suppress it and work through it"
"I'm okay, but lately I've had outbursts and I'm probably just regretting it for lack of sleep or just"
"Tension that rises and problems continue, but I don't like that I'm just trying to stay calm"
< slaughter>
Oh oh wow around
"I don't like arguing, but there was <wa> I was arguing with uh"
a girl who worked in a cinema and
"She gave people wrong directions on which line to stand or to, and she was like she caused trouble, and I said you know they have to stand over here and they won't send them there, that they don't go into the"
to the film screening and there were some discussions and I was of course right that it gave false information.
that was at grauman's Chinese theater
k
"Well, I have a twin brother I live with, but we don't understand each other, we're total opposites."
"I have a <Laughter> sister I probably haven't seen or talked to in 18 years, I have a younger brother."
I don't see him much.
And what's sad I anyway in just having a mother who's still around her like < makes sounds with mouth> seventy-five
probably in the last three years only no communication no phone calls no facebooking only
Only separate is it like we're not interested
"As she always is, I never had a father who the father left when I was four and..."
she was always a housewife always yes she was always on welfare and food stamps I just she never really worked I wish she did something more she just
"You know I love her, but"
We don't have a relationship anymore.

"And that's when I can't sleep when I get two or three hours, so there's your answer in me, I can sleep okay because"
