value
Hello.
Yes
All right.
not
Too bad.
I'm from Chicago.
South side
around back in nineteen seventy-eight
When I was eighteen
yes <y>
lately
not much maybe every two or three years
"It's different, you know."
terrible weather and uh
"Yeah, it's just a completely different atmosphere."
um
"Let's see, my mother had moved to Africa."
I graduated from high school
"and I had a friend out here, so I just thought good let me try l_a"
uh very simple actually yes I loved it from the moment I got off the plane
"Yeah, that's good."
Number one the weather
Sun is very important to me
so I love the weather
I don't know what a more relaxed atmosphere is.
Variety
from humans
And now it's my...
my home base you know
my
Friends
the family are
So it's kind of like my family's here now.
hmm
I guess the smog earthquakes
um
Transport
simple basic things like this really
"Um, I don't know right now, but I've been traveling all my life"
quite a lot
I just wanted to see.
See
other crops; and
See for more history and
Meeting with people and
just fun and the fun of it also
To see a journey
I went to
england
ireland and scotland and france all in
you know
a journey
so that was a nice variety
um
"I guess you could say, probably skiing"
in val d'isere france
That was fun.
I'm glad I have to do this.
I'm shy by nature
I tried to grow out of shy so
"I'm not quite shy, but I've always been an extremely shy"
Child
But now here in the bold city this is my
Environment and I guess you could say I'm not really shy in
in my hometown of the culver city
hm
to relax I like to just lure myself into my bed and take a nap reading my book
Clock t_v
sometimes on the couch in the living room
only you know to stay at home and
a little vegetative
ah pretty good yeah my temperament is pretty level
hm
Probably with my
Husband
and
I can't remember what it was about right now.
"Well, if you say my family, you mean"
my family from childhood or my current family
"Okay well I think my current family comes to mind, I have two daughters"
and
"My relationship is pretty good, it's okay with them, but they're teenagers who uh"
you know
go through a lot of hormones and
um
they can be kind of bitchy <Laughter> and
"And I was hoping that you know they're growing up and soon, one day, we're gonna have a really good relationship."
"And then there's the husband, the"
I think I could say soon to be ex-husband hopefully soon <Laughter>
"We have to get a divorce, but we're still together."
for financial reasons
and yes
"Yeah, so that's not good."
"the relationship with the man, but..."
but since we have decided that we must get divorced
"we expect nothing from each other, so we don't argue so much, so that's good"
hm
All right.
I guess...
Our Marriage
I wish I'd noticed early on that
"You know, it was like getting away from what I thought it was."
"Let's see, O my God"
The most difficult decision
I guess leaving my first husband who was pretty hard
"Well, you know, we were married and I wasn't"
Content I think you could say
Ahem and
I'm just...
gave up our relationship and
"I think that now that I look back, it's because"
I wanted to
Children and he would have been happy to have none
And so uh since I didn't have a father
it was very important
that i
Making children with someone who really wanted to be a father
And so I was kind of
at an age when I had to start thinking about it
with children
"nor was I with someone who really wasn't in it, so that"
I think that's a uh maybe the main reason why I wasn't satisfied and I just
felt like
This marriage won't work.
So you know that we went to therapy and everything and he didn't want to break up and

<tisk> and I had to leave him
because I was just not happy and that was very hard because
you know
"I felt like I was hurting him what I was, you know, and he survived that he survived, now he's married to two children <Laughter>"
<Laughter> but around
It was
Hard
to leave him
mm
something I wish I could erase from my memory
I have to think about it.
I'm sure there's a little bit of asp> Oh good
"Yeah, there's..."
I guess it would be nice to delete
"from my memory to a new I don't mean new, but an event"
in my
Recently adult age here in the culver city
where one of my best friends
um
I betrayed myself.
"Years ago, when my husband was first in real estate"
she and her family grew and they really needed a bigger home
and
um
We just assumed that you knew they'd use it.
my husband as their agent both to sell their current home electricity at the time
and buy a new home
<tisk> and how it turned out
they have surprised us and
had spoken to this other local agent
And yes.
That was devastating.
I don't think I've ever been betrayed.
It's like the
"So I wish I could erase this now, because now you know that was back when the kids were really young."
and
"my daughter at the time when my youngest daughter was, let's say"
Six maybe
um
Maybe five
"Whatever you're doing,"
She and my best friend
Daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other
we were pregnant together
and
"they were really tight these two little girls and they didn't end up in the same primary school so they didn't hang out during these years, but every time we run them in the neighborhood or they"
to meet in a summer camp or something that they were just so connected
"You know like two peas in a pod, though it is."
Her mothers stopped talking to each other.
So now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together
and they are still very connected in fact <Laughter>
for the first time she spent the night in our house last night with my daughter
And another girl
And it's just a little embarrassing because you know it now.
These girls are
Always really good friends better friends
um
and yet
I still have that.
Vibrant
um
bad memory
of what they
her mom closed up
for me
That was about what
Ten
About eight years ago
"In any case,"
"I tried, I tried,"
Ignore it and push it out of my head and
which I was able to do <sniff>
over the last few years
but obviously it's still coming
"Anyway, that was that"
It's not that simple.
"I get a decent sleep sometimes, but"
sometimes it's hard to sleep and most of the time I wake up
and can't sleep again
"or I'll finally sleep again and then it's almost time to get up, you know that"
this difficult thing
"Well, waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by going to the toilet <Laughter>"
and then
"You know, it's not always that easy to sleep again and then I wake up to go to the toilet."
So I guess that's the trigger
until sleep a hard time there
I don't know I think too much.
run through my mind and the day
I feel like I haven't reached enough during the day so
It's hard for me to just go to sleep if I'm supposed to
I guess...
um
"Well, I'm kind of used to it now"
So I just keep going.
probably looking through the day <Laughter> looking tired and around
"I'm used to being tired, I just do what I have to do."
and sometimes when I'm able to when I'm home and don't have
huge commitments yeah I could just take a nap or something like I said before
Read my book watch t_v watch whatever
"lately, how did I feel about"
Type from bottom
on myself down to life
"Well, I still have this outstanding"
Necessity <n> Necessity for Separation Slashed Divorce
um
"I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls, now they're teenagers."
You know on the edge of adulthood
And so I'm worried that
you know
I've done all kinds of things wrong.
with her leadership and her early childhood and < clears throat> now it's too late
um
as if I'd missed a thing < th> a lot of things
uh
"And yes, I need a job, I'm unemployed, I don't know what I want to do with my life."
I know I want to do something
I just wish...
"You know, I never finished college, unfortunately, because I was on my way and so"
So I'm sorry that extreme
and I have to get a job and take care of myself because I
Divorce and move on with my life
so
"now I forget what the original question was, but <Laughter>"
um
This is the state.
Part of the state of my life
no
Yes
mm < tisk>
All right.
for the first time or or or recently
The first time I think was
"You know, when I was in my early twenties, I was just a little bit"
"Angry about <Laughter> by chance, that was another breakup I had to do back then"
I was...
"<tisk> in my early twenties and I had to break up with my boyfriend, but again it was very disturbing because I"
It was hard because he didn't want to break up and I felt like I was hurting him.
and I didn't understand that feeling
I was really excited.
"as I did not, my first time was with depression, so I didn't really do it"
"recognize it as depression, but I went somehow i"
==References==
Knowledge or knowledge
I was able to
"Take me to a psychiatrist, I remember paying her by the hour."
and she prescribed Xanax to just help me relax
and so I guess that helped me through this and then I have depression over the years just you know small parts here and there for various reasons like
I guess it's usually a relationship <Laughter>
um
"Yeah, so the last time I was diagnosed"
and take medication
that was probably around
Two years ago
no
I don't have insurance.
"otherwise yes, I would like"
for therapy <Laughter>
anything that could help
"Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,"
Boy
the last time I felt really happy
um
"I don't know, I guess maybe"
when my children were born
This is
um
I guess happy I don't know <Laughter> I just know you know
"I always wanted kids, so it was nice"
to have them
This is
"I don't know, that's all I can remember that I don't think I don't remember the good times too well <Laughter> I remember the bad times"
mm
something I did that I really enjoyed
All right.
Let's see if I...
Friday night I went to a friend's house
and met with
five other girlfriends and we
We created Vision Boards
and spoke and
had dinner
"at one of their houses, that was the fun"
"Yeah, that's good."
we arrive
ooh <sigh>
stay in college get my degree
um
get therapy try to become a happy
um
Yeah trying to figure things out earlier in life
For example:
"Yeah, that's good."
Stay in college and oh and especially I think that the main you know what it all cooks < laughter> no matter what you feel depressed about it like
as the proverb says and the songs <s> the
Songs you know
it's all about money the world is about money and
with none
that in itself is very depressing <Laughter> so next to relationships and various things that have happened in your life
Without money
is
"You know, it's like you can't even try to fix something because you don't have the money to fix it."
so
"in this sense, I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree"
and to stay <s> to get a job and stick to it
um
Don't stop.
"to go travel you know,"
easy with a job stick with a company build your
Age of service you retain your benefits
and build up some knowledge or knowledge in some kind of field
"Yes, it would have been."
my greatest advice for me
not much <Laughter>
I guess...
only my daughters you know
beautiful daughters and
I am proud and glad that I was able to have children some people
"are not even able to do that you know, and they try so hard, or they look back at their lives and they wish they had done so"
"this is the one thing I mean, I wanted"
"five kids and I always wanted a boy I never had, but"
I'm
I guess that's the
the biggest thing I can do
Remember to be proud
has my two daughters
um
I am a very loyal
Friend and Person
That's why
"When this friend betrayed me, it was so devastating"
"Yes, very loyal."
Very
"<inhale> happy <hap> I mean, what I'd say I'd say happy happy <l> going lucky I don't know where that came from, I'm very much I wanted to say friendly"
and
Maintenance and
"Yes, I care about people."
and I'm interested in people
and
I'll take care of it.
also animals
I'm proud to be a vegetarian.
Yeah so my daughters and be vegetarian
I'm a vegetarian because it's important to me.
"feelings of other beings not only humans, but also animals and"
I don't think animals should be tortured.
"And a hard life,"
Just so we can eat them.
"So, um..."
What was the question?
remember the question
All right.
You're welcome.
See you.
