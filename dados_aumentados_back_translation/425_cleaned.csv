value
Yes
"I'm fine, I feel a little tired and uh"
Concerned
um
"Well, I'm looking for a place to live, and I just don't have a job, so..."
Things are a little bit
wobbly for me
I'll stay with my son in Venice.
"It's pretty good, but we both have to have our own room, so I'm looking for another place to live."
"originally from New York, but I've been doing this in California since the early seventies."
"Yeah, that's good."
"I moved to l_a because I had lived in Portland Oregon and I was tired of the weather up there and my son was down here, so it seemed like a good place."
"It wasn't too hard for me to meet people right away, and..."
"I just like it here, so it was easy to connect with people"
the weather is <Laughter> number one as for most people I love to be near the ocean
um
I like the energy I like that around me likes the artistic culture
mhm
"Uh good everyone loves traffic I love the weather and hates traffic, so I feel somehow <fee> I feel the same way around"
sometimes it is
it will carry a little that it is so busy and the fact that it is so expensive makes it difficult
not as much as I would like if I had more means <fu> more income more means I would travel more
"Well, most of the time I'm already..."
"xxx I traveled, let's see, so my longest uh journey, the"
was outside the country was to Mexico and I traveled
went with a friend to Oaxaca
and the whole trip we have about mm I think we
took us about four weeks down and back from the bay area
"Yeah, that was a fun trip."
"Well, we were working on the census together and she had made this trip a few times and invited me to come with her."
of this journey I would say we were in Oaxaca for the Day of the Dead
So it was uh day of the dead with the family in the little village where we lived and
Everyone in the village makes an altar in her house uh for her
Uh lovers who have died
and
"they also decorate clean and decorate the graves, so there were many flowers and it was just neat to be there and celebrate with this family that"
uh
"Well, I studied <studi> I was in the liberal liberal art program, but I didn't stay <st> I just stayed in school for uh in college for a few years"
but I was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities
"huh my dream job would uh personally support someone,"
was in a creative area
and travel to uh and go to events with them
"It's hard to break in, I'm starting very minimally with someone I do more."
Voluntary
Work with me and I'm working on building some of my skills so I can do more of it.
"I'm pretty kind of an introvert, so I know I don't have any trouble meeting people, I don't hold back and..."
You know xxx just I'm not shy <sh> how shy at parties I'm going to go upstairs and talk to people
um
but I'm overall kind of introverted so around
I prefer one-to-one
as
Large groups
um
I like to see it uh good i <Laughter> I like to see uh improvement shows how on uh h_g_t_v I like to see around
see how to renovate and transform or watch movies
or read
Oh and I'm playing a solitaire on my uh ignite my fire
um
I don't usually know that I'm mad until later <Laughter> so <Laughter> it doesn't really come up dead
and I just tend not to have the kind of life where
um
these situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road
"I get annoyed a little, uh, I don't get so upset like when people cut me off or something..."
"But if people are deliberately rude and you honk for no reason, or..."
"You know, if they get angry because maybe I did something unintentional that you accidentally cut off and they..."
they get really angry then makes me angry in return
hmm <sigh>
um
"Yeah, like I said, I can't really fight"
I had <ha> I was with a friend the other day and around
she got angry with me because she felt like I was correcting her
"So it wasn't really an argument, but she"
You know that I had said something that
she heard as correction also it was a correction
and she got angry at but
um
well then I felt criticized and I felt vulnerable
"It wasn't me, it was pretty uncomfortable."
hmm
um
"Well, I..."
in this situation
I didn't have to correct it.
um
So [sighing]
I think this is something I look at in myself is my need to be right.
so in general
that's me trying to catch this and
Just leave people
Make mistakes without <Laughter> without telling them about it
mm
hmm
"Boy, I don't know."
That's hard.
I don't know that I've had so many problems making decisions.
hmm
"Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
has been
hard to decide for me
to uh
to let my cat sleep when he was sick
Oh it was <wa> and I had to give up a cat to
when I once moved and
And that was also difficult because
To <sigh>
well in the case of the first cat who was sick to
I've decided when the vet
said that he thought it was the human decision
um
and with the cat I didn't have to give up
i
I didn't really decide that I'd move to a place where
Where I couldn't take her
and so i
I found someone to take her with me.
hmm <sigh>
mm
see
um
That's hard.
if I don't really get the deletion from the memory part around
There's nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory
um
try to think of something I did that I
I wish I hadn't.
um
"Oh okay, I remember something was there <wa> <Laughter> there was a time when I was"
"I was in a class at junior college, it was a movie class."
and uh
I was the one who was around after we left and made a little film project.
um
And we're supposed to put it back in class next week. I was the one who had the movie.
and by various
"only things that happened in my life right now, I never went back to school, but I never"
brought the movie back to them so that all the work they had done
They had to do it again and I still feel bad about it.
"Oh, it's pretty easy, sometimes I wake up"
"in the early morning hours and and have difficulty sleeping again, but this is not very often"
I've been kind of tired and lowly depressed and like not feeling a lot of options
no
"Yes, I have"
"Well, there have been twice that it once came back in like nineteen seventy"
two nineteen < nineteen> yeah around nine nineteen seventy two or three and then around
Another time around
"Oh, so, when would that have been about sixteen years ago?"
um
just the feeling that it's not about
you know the feeling that things won't change
if I don't get some help and that if I
I didn't need to know that if I had a few medications that would help me.
um
Short term
so
I'm not going to therapy now.
Uh I moved around a lot of finance I wasn't really feeling the need to start thinking it could be a
another option
I feel like therapy can be useful yes
"Well, when I went to therapy..."
it was helpful to have someone who listened and
could also
offer impartial proposals to help me
improve the way I felt
To <sigh>
I was at the beach last weekend.
It was a beautiful day and I sat in the sun and
just relaxing and I had my notebook and I did something to write and
I felt very happy and satisfied
I am friendly and compassionate and I am a good listener
and I'm smart and I got uh I have good ideas
To <sigh>
"Well, I wish that uh"
"Sometimes I wish I was a tougher worker, I'm not really ready to take"
"Low-wage jobs, although"
I need work so I don't feel like I'm ready to do something.
um
and
"I wish I could act, I said I had good ideas to have good ideas and I'm good at"
"Uh the beginning, but I'm not really good at following-through so"
"Many of these ideas begin, but then"
I don't take the distance from them
That's probably what I want to change the most about myself
"Ten or twenty years ago, I advised myself to go back to school and graduate."
ends my training
um
and be ready to
to work
a regular job and to
to start putting money
away for my
Pensions

and I'm proud that to
What's that?
People who admire me and appreciate my opinion
Goodbye.
