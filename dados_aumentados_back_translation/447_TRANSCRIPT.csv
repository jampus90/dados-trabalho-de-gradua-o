"The first time I was in New York, I was about 11 years old."
"and I made sure that I got the window seat in the plane and only the feeling of taking off is just intoxicating, but uh"
We're gone.
"around <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in New York, so it was kind of confusing to get used to the change of time"
The first thing I remember was getting a piece of New York pizza.

Scrubbed_entry
Degree with a Bachelor's degree in Communication

"Actually, it's like what"
I don't know what it's like.
You must have a plan.

"To be honest, a job that doesn't exist <Laughter> it is"
but you can be paid to do nothing <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
But...
likely
"I was definitely shy when I was a kid, but I grew up with the experience of college, so I'm much more open"
"uh i write music and i usually work like this when i feel stressed, i just make a number of push-ups and raise some weights"

I saw a therapist when I was a kid for about a year
"and I don't know, it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and I don't think I do it in the best way because when I'm angry I do"

"not really, it was rather an interpersonal thing that"
I don't know.

so many...
I guess in my senior year of high school I waited until the last minute to apply for u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because I didn't turn into applications and I'm pretty sure I would have been admitted
"So it sucks, but"
"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey"
this is a fascinating question <sigh>um
I don't really know.
the death of my grandmother
safe
um
my grandmother died when I was 11 years old
She drew me from the time I was born because my mother was unable to take care of me
"She raised my sister, my brother, and my cousin."
"and her five children, so she was the matriarch of our family"
and <sigh> the next thing I had to get a mother
"and it was hard, but"
It will take seven years for the next to come to the thirtieth.
and I've grown a little bit no more tears
"I'm a foster child, so I was emancipated by the nursing program about two years ago."
but around my immediate family I'm pretty close to them
"and I see them as much as I can and uh my foster family they're awesome, I've known them since I was five, so it was pretty cool"
"pretty easy I fall asleep pretty fast, it's no problem unless my back hurts you know, then it's a problem"
mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning I think I drive more aggressive <laughter>
"Uh a little stressed about a few problems I can take over, but I shouldn't stress because I can either do something about it or I can't and that's just the way things work"
"Um, sure, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, uh, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,"
"I have a few parking tickets, no parking tickets they don't move injuries, but they're tickets"
And I didn't realize if you'd miss the courthouse without being in the hospital or being in prison.
"that you could not be excused not to make your court appointment, so I had"
Three no-shows in court that sucked
Tickets that are thousands of dollars and I don't have any money like that
I don't know.
"it's pretty hard to deal with when you're trying to make something of your life, but"
"There are so many barriers and obstacles that like you have not forgotten, so I don't know that it is sometimes stressful and"
"Yeah, that's good."
think about it for periods of time some days I just sit and I'm just lost in my mind and I don't really communicate
to everyone because there's nothing anyone can really do for me
So I just fill it up like I do
all
not very after doing it for so long it will be a natural thing i think
no
no
Hm really happy oh
Why is that such a difficult question?
"I don't know, I'm pretty satisfied with everything I don't know about extreme happiness right now, every day is exactly the same day"
Looks like it's...
Uh Dunking
on the other side of the Clippers Center there is a basketball court there
and uh I've been working on it for a while and I finally got up <laugher> yeah
mm I have
four close friends I've known for over eight years
"and I don't know, studious work hard"
Determined
I don't know.
<Laughter> yeah <Laughter>
"mm probably my metabolism, which I don't really have control over, uh I don't know, I'm pretty satisfied with myself"
hmm <sigh>
I think in my sixth year of uh
uh primary school
"I wasn't the best student, but..."
"I had a teacher who was diligent and how he let me down throughout the year, but I learned a lot and uh I developed a passion for school afterwards, so it was like a situation that I overcome after I felt so bad"
and bottom
"uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad because if it wasn't for his stars, I don't think I had"
To be the discipline where I'm now in college and so that he was pretty influential.
uh
I remember this time I was in the desert or uh uh uh up in Joshua tree with my best friend and his father
and we are actually stuck in the mountains and as if we had gone down a gorge
"And then his jeep did not come upon a rock, so it was beautiful"
"Yeah, it was around <tisk> it was kind of weird I thought I was Superman I was trying to move a skirt"
That was thousands of pounds that didn't work.
"but yes we finally came out we thought we were stuck in the desert, but it was a fun time to drive in the desert, if I didn't have my license, so it was fun yeah"
about this day or in general
mm
"unlike the u_c thing, where I did not apply to the schools in time"
I regret that
"Yeah, that's good."
hm
"I don't know that I was ten years old, ten years ago."
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."

That's an interesting question.
