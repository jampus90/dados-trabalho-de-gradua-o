value
"Yeah, I'm fine."
"I'm good, I'm a little tired, but I'm good"
"Michigan, I'm from mirigan"
um
a long time ago
then I left
uh
once twice a year
cold <Laughter> very cold
Because I wanted to pursue my acting career
uh
All right.
"It wasn't a hard decision, it was just the weather, it was the opportunity"
it were the options
more options
Uh driving was a pain in the butt not so easy
<sigh> let's see
except for the weather
I like that.
Things are more comfortable
I like some of the people here.
"<Laughter> who are actually from home, but..."
"Yeah, I like that it's a little relaxed."
That's it.
I don't like traffic
I don't like it.
Uh the gang-violence
in certain areas and I don't like
What else do I don't like?
What are you doing?
Maybe that's all I don't like
I don't know oh you know I like I don't like it so far away from home I wish
I wish I were
I wish it wasn't so far from home
I have a close relationship with my family
um
it's a small uh immediate family is really small
"and we've passed near my grandmother recently, so it's around < tisk> an adjustment now"
but I'm close to my family
"Well, I can't see your shoes, but I travel a lot"
"I'm travelling, yeah"
"I like to get there as soon as I'm where I'm going, I really like to do the tourist thing, get to know places and"
People
uh okay i oh I went around france a few years ago well many years and a small town called catalonne and was very much around
"it was actually really fun, but very much like a story book so far what I expected to see and what I actually saw"
"like me, what I remember that I was really enjoying that at night when everyone close, as there are no windows in the buildings, but"
they are these shutters that most places in the United States have inside windows they have them outside the windows and there is no glass so they just closed and it looks like everything is leaving as if the buildings are leaving pretty cool < sniff> I like that
I'm at the border
Sometimes I'm shy sometimes I'm going away it depends on who and what the situation is
To music I turn on music I go
through the neighborhoods you know
"I'm pretty good at controlling my temperament, I'm not"
Hot head at all
hm
"Oh, it was an ex-roommate"
And it was about my loyalty as a friend
"Yeah, pretty much she..."
thought that because I wanted my rent
which it has agreed to pay
the
I had not taken
"to be a good friend, that I should just let her live for nothing and"
that would not happen
So you know it
Loyalty came with you anyway to let stay or let her stay anyway
even if she didn't pay me
So this is a friend.
I could have thrown her out.
"she went at the agreed time after she told me she wouldn't pay, but"
you know
If I had...
"There could have been a bad situation, but there was an argument."
a real real
I wish I had treated this situation differently and followed my first mind as
We agreed to be temporary roommates
and
to get my money in advance
That's what I wish I had done and I just didn't have my mind told me to join in
"No, my mind told me to get the money in advance."
But I didn't do it.
so
mm
the toughest decision
um
"I think I still have the toughest decision to make, but as far as"
<tisk<> maybe to leave home
"When I was 18 years ago,"
"Yeah, that's good."
um
I felt like I was leaving my family
<Laughter> that's what I felt <Laughter> but they encouraged me to go further and live my life
mhm
"Uh, something I could erase from my memory"
likely
a friend
Who
I was...
I'm going out with you.
I'd like to erase from my memory how he reacted to me when I told him that my grandmother was sick.
"It's easy when I'm busy all day and I'm really tired, but actually my mind is spinning like this."
"It's not that easy, it's not that easy"
I'd have to
'Cause I have to
be exhausted
I must be exhausted
Exhaust
no
It's not really hard to do just a lot of things all day long
Irritable
up and down
up and down and down as sometimes I have
were excited and anxious and on the other hand I'm like
mm
What am I doing?
"Yeah, it's just scared to let a few things happen."
Some objectives
and
uh
to get a certain kind of work
and
with a certain amount of
Income
and uh
"I'm just taking care of myself, you know how I think I should"
"Take care of myself, just the physical stuff."
Eating properly and everything
"Yeah, that's good."
I've been
Sometimes I have a lot
distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I have to concentrate on right now
"and I'm aware that I'm like all the things that pop up in my head, why do I think about it?"
I let them happen and then I try to think about other things and
phase it out it reappears on I phase it out
"Yeah, that's good."
no
no
uh
"When the roommate went out,"
I was really happy when she finally left
"Ahem, probably reading"
"and maybe go go go dance, which would be ideal, I can go go go dance salsa dance"
and yes
mm
my ability to make a decision faster
and to act on it
really bad
"Uh, I don't know if I have a time someone has ever made me really bad"
I don't know.
Feel bad about
much
uh
as brave
that would be it at a glance
in general
um
"I do not regret making some different decisions when I was younger, as far as"
Progress with as far as career stuff and
Relationship things I wish I had done some things
earlier in my life that I do now
Uh really after a few of my personal goals and
um
Decision to actually be in a relationship that is long-term and
"Yeah, I wish I'd done that sooner"
Twenty years ago I would have
"gave advice to himself,"
um
Next
with my training
beyond what I have done
and
to be more discernment in my choices of individuals that I allow in my life
um
to be a part of the family I am a part of
Thank you.
Goodbye.
