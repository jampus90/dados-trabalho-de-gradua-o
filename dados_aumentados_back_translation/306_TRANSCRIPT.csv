Oh the weather uh the beach sunsets on the beach
uh the thought of uh career opportunities
um
an educated group of people demanding market
"it's an adaptation uh to come here many people misjudge it a little it's a relaxed appearing city, but it's actually very much to know uh sensitive to you"
Uh success and commercialization and this kind of thing
So you have to keep the pace
"this is a bit more difficult, I think if you make the adjustment first"
and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market where you just have to work hard as you do it in others
"Oh, be a lawyer."
mhm
oh just because you have the power you can use oh you know skills to be able to affect people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being an assistant in this area
oh uh a lot of it is no longer around just brothers and sisters from the state so not particularly close now
Dishonesty
Lack of sympathy
Uh insensitivity you know
Very good.

Art galleries
Oh uh my daughter
"I only have one daughter who graduated from u_c_l_a law school and uh I raised her all alone without any help, so it seemed like an achievement that was worth the two jobs and the work was"
"I think it's difficult, I think it's a difficult job that requires a lot more work than most people give him credit for if you want to do it right, you know, it's always second guess of your behavior and this kind of thing"
I'd say group pressure.
it can change everything a parent has tried to put in a child that is good
Scrubbed_entry
So this was a really bad time for us
"To I think it depends on which neighborhood or state you are in, or the uh"
I think they are a little misguided I think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired at the moment
"I think they're burdened by the worries of the wars and so on, and I think they can probably get a"
Uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as opposition to only more separate group than a family [fam] once they were I think
You know how uninspired at the moment
"I worry sometimes because you know problems with work, but it's pretty easy."
"No, I don't feel like I'm not sleeping, I just know you know I'm gonna worry about something at work occasionally."
"Oh, God, a few weeks ago."
"oh just uh you know, unfortunately we need to worry you know that I'm lucky, that's not easier it's just the collaboration between people uh it solves most of everything you know so you always want that around you"
only stressed
Yeah emphasizes more
mhm
To yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not how you feel or misjudge things that you might judge differently if you were better rested
Uh not depression
"um probably yeah I was that as a possibility I had an employment lawsuit a few years ago and uh actually sued it and won the settlement around something about whistleblower-thing implications [in] implications of that and around and I was somehow bothered about it and so I found when I came out of it I couldn't immediately find work in my own area, so I had to go back to u_c_l_a and a new uh professional direction and"
"I sometimes felt scared that it would happen again, you know, and you think that would never happen again, you know."
"To just that I noticed that I noticed that I felt very uh in my legal class, I had a section on labor law"
"and there was a very complicated file that I had done with a lot of work and study for my case, but once faced with it again in this class setting I just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and I realized that I was traumatized by having to go through that again to know that yeah post-traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down"
from what I understand and so I think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that I had to get the paper back and wow you know no adrenaline just wow
there is a xxxx
back back
"just uh just extreme uh you know, avoiding something to do, that should have been easy for me"
"and uh and think about it as thoroughly as I should have studied it or deport it uh the feeling of going through the paper, this kind of paper, even if there was only one class assignment again"
you know
"Well, not lately, you know for sure when what happened about ten years ago, now it was decided in court about seven years ago."
"and yes, it was effective, you know, it was effective in the way you see most everything and in your trust and this kind of thing"
I'm sorry I repeated the question.
"I feel peaceful, yes, I was peaceful that it is, but angry that it has ever happened."
"So it's hard, I'll probably never feel peaceful about this topic ever it always"
the mention of it always makes me angry that I had to go through the yeah
I don't think I've tried anything to avoid it.
"I think that was also an aggravation for me because I'm a patient person, realistic and around and I tried everything to avoid confrontations in the matter, but it was only necessary to try, you know, help me cover the damage to my daughter's life"
"I don't now maybe once in my life not now you, if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you overcome the perceptions of people or their judgments of you if you can"
effectively explain something and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself
that others usually have judgments about age or something like that
um
well just raise a daughter you know or uh
They know only to the experience of thinking that this was one after all the years that was a success was their graduation from the legal school
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm just...
like a lot of work had a good end
Uh you know happy that it fulfilled wishes or dreams for this child have been fulfilled
You know that and she was able to make this success
Wow for [Laughter]
"I tend to be happy with life, because the alternative will do harm, that you know your ability is successful."
"So I'm trying to force luck I think in most situation in my life route I find something about it, uh, when I lost some weight recently that made me really happy"
"I travel a little locally I traveled more than I was younger I really enjoyed, but only too busy in recent years"
Only new places to take the ability to take care of the worries we have every day work
or worry and somehow see them away for a while and something new
You know the way
I go back to uh colorado san riosco went through Vale and uh and spent the night there and around and it was only in spring when there were not many skiers and it was just nice and very quiet
many restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was nice
"Yeah, that's good."
Wow uh
only
I work hard loyally.
To be creative
"To just see something you're creating, you're trying to create, something you hoped the picture would know if that was the case."
"You know, just hard work uh just met or presented yourself in a certain way that you know that it makes you happy"
to my daughter around very [ver] pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she sends me pictures all the time
All right.
See you.
