value
Yes
All right.
from here anyway from Alhambra
the weather is really nice and everything is very familiar
Uh sometimes there's too much traffic jam on the roads too much traffic
I studied art and photography
It wasn't so much a decision that I kept noticing that I was very interested in it.
Yes
I'm a photographer.
mhm
oh
"I suppose, uh"
um
run a family portrait studio or any other type of photography business
uh no no no I'm also an apartment manager it keeps me tied
It's fair that it's not the best because it's an apartment manager.
"I have a free rent, but I have to stay."
There's a lot
so 
that part does the free rental part is very good
"Oh, God!"
my most memorable experience
That's hard to say
um 
All right.
"I mean, there are good and bad unforgettable experiences"
oh
"Well, I guess some s s s s like sports success when I was in high school"
there were some of the things I was happy about
and
some works of art I made were unforgettable
and
"some bad things would be the death of my father, you know, but these are very memorable not good though"
uh 
"Well, my parents and my I have a lot of brothers and sisters, uh so that my family"
"uh pretty close, but most of them live around l_a"
There are a few who come from far <f>
away <di> uh away my brother lives in New York and
my other brother lives in maui <free throat>
mhm
"Oh, mostly very talented"
<ss> just to get more involved in the technology than maybe I was
or I am and they are about
I think they're more of a hive ghost than when I grew up
Looks like they're all entangled in social media.
Go for a walk or
Watching TV
or play with my computer
and uh
"Uh, good."
There are some <so> some
uh 
There's a kind of uh
Injustices That Do Not Happen
"no big deals, but for example our parking situation deteriorated with some new District Parking"
that's kind of disturbing and the city doesn't seem to want to
uh make any exceptions or change some rules
"and also uh some unfair things sometimes happen at work, the riots are <ups>"
"Uh, who're annoying"
- Nope.
I worked for <f> at school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> I worked at a high school dance uh this past weekend and when we arrived at the site
"people on the premises said we couldn't do all our gear and scenery and things in the place where we were assigned to do it, that we were going outside"
"and then get an OK to go in because we weren't prepared outside, nor even said in advance that we should be outside"
"It delayed our setup time and that wouldn't have bothered me, except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained."
that we set up too late when they told us
"to wait for them and we told them we would delay when we wait and we still have a complaint, so this part is annoying and"
And our work doesn't support those in the office they need to please the school to keep the account.
"Uh often, when something like that happens, it means that they won't send you to work at this school again, which would translate into less pay hours for the photographers who were in this job"
"Yeah, that's how they do things."
so that this is disturbing
Uh most of the time I dust from my resume <Laughter> and look for other situations that
this could be better
um 
"Yeah, that's good."
Uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx
"I could the moment I don't really lose it, but xxx later I could..."
but right now I wouldn't do that
um
We have a tight schedule today and I have a friend with whom I share a car.
We argued where to go first.
And so we compromised and
has most of her stuff and one of my stuff then after
"That was one of the things that are over, then we're gonna do more of their stuff."
but it
"Yeah, that's good."
no
Post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what
uh
No I didn't
Yes
"Oh, I'd say nineteen eighty"
"Yes, I think it was nineteen eighty."
"Yeah, that's good."
um
"Well, my father noticed some symptoms, my father is just good, he died, but he was a psychiatrist"
um
"Well, I wasn't sleeping, I was lying around the house"
To wake me up at
"At noon, something like that, and I didn't have a..."
Focus like for a job it wasn't clear enough
I remember a few job interviews that I would go to her front door and then I wouldn't go into <Laughter> and I think that was all part of the depression
"Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was."
no
All right.
"I went for three years, and then the psychiatrist said,"
He thought I was finished <laughter> but uh
and I and I came to a much better place that I have to watch all the time to see what's going on
"with depression, so I think I'll have good and bad days"
um
I think the therapy will let you see what...
as I thought it would be as a filter or with a pair of <pa> as if you weren't really looking for a depression pair of sunglasses
"You see everything through this, so you have to somehow <k> I have to somehow"
try to take out the glasses for a little and double check I'm really aware of these things exactly
or see it through a depressed view
and I'm trying to find clues about it
I think I'm...
A bit slip backwards uh uh i don't do well during the unemployed periods
"I have noticed on my way in my past and around the moment we have a work slower, so it is easy to slip back into sleep too late or expose things because the schedule is too far open for"
for me personally as a depressed person I think that structure is really important
It's...
It takes you out of bed and you have to go somewhere in time and
Deal interaction with people is all these are all useful things for someone who tends to be depressed
uh 
"Well, I don't know if it's changes, how I tend to be a little focused on some things that are"
"Probably not that uplifting we say uh, but it's rather negative like i"
have had <ha> somehow thought about how to
um
"Soldiers in the past uh I don't know why, but how the ancient Greeks during the Roman era or the Greeks would have been in a frontline fight with"
mm
They know only raw <cru> type of raw <cru> in my opinion raw weapons and no medical help and
"that I don't know, I seem to be going a lot where I'm thinking about it and I've seen it and read books about it or about video clips on youtube and"
Eh things like this or
some other things <thi> other uh somehow like terrible doom type subjects as I watched on the animal show like crocodile attacks and such things
where should probably not be so much on that
"Oh, you mean well in life in general"
"I think I'm sorry I didn't finish college, I think I was <wa>"
Uh went into depression right then and wasn't coping very well in my last year
and to not really
"I didn't come out of college with a degree even though I was there seven years, but uh, that's very that's a big regret that I've had"
um 
I think it would be...
at certain points I would probably have been looking for therapy and also probably some
Uh outside help only to get through the finals only the logistics
I had I was an art major and I didn't have a car like this
many of the art projects and things were hard to move back and forth and
and also to meet uh in distant places I think it would probably have been worth
do whatever was necessary to get a car at that time
so 
um 
I was told that I was very patient.
and I also have some original artistic ideas
so 
These are
"these are good qualities, which I am very loyal and also"
"You know, I support my friends, I'm pretty generous with them."
so
"Yeah, that's good."
Let's see.
xxx really enjoyed was I had a
I had a nice experience uh just uh photographing around a football game recently
I really enjoyed that so
mhm
All right.
It's been a pleasure.
Thank you very much.
