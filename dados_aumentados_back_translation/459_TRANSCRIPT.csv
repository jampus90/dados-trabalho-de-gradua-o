and I was there for two weeks and that was the last time I've been there
in Costa rica

Seeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker
for joy I was happy excited somehow scared
"It wasn't my decision, it was my mother's."
She had planned the trip.
"Yeah, that's good."
"Uh, I wanted to be an art major, but"
"I didn't understand why I was in math classes among other classes and I thought I was wasting my time, so I decided I really didn't want to do that."
So I moved back to l_a.
I don't really have a dream job uh i

It was
about me buying a
Ticket last night for a greyhound
to go to Utah
I go up there to work a few weeks and make some money and I had to buy my ticket a week in advance and I didn't want to do it last night.
this situation last night
"I wish I hadn't blown up, or"
got as angry as I can about the situation because it escalated
"my little sister, with whom I am very close"
She is 15 years old and will be sixteen in a few days.
"I would do anything for her, she's the world for me, my mother, we fight, we push each other's buttons"
"I think she sees me as my father, she thinks that I"
will succeed with nothing
sad
It's okay.

I just started taking some other drugs and
"It came out of hand, I guess, and"
"my mom wanted to help me and I didn't want the help, so I kept going to different places and run away and not"
"I wanted to be in those places, so I finally agreed to go to Utah and try to get sober"

"Yeah, it's not fun."
I lay in bed until I finally fell asleep in the early morning.
