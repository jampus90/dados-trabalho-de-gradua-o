value
hi
safe
All right.
Uh original I'm from uh korea
mhm
When I was a year old
Yes
I've almost never been to Korea.
"Uh I love the weather <sigh> and being at the sea and the culture has a lot of things to do, the food there is a lot to like"
um
transport in order to:
It seems as if
We have a lot of uh economic difficulties and the
the parking cards are super high I sometimes I really am
Annoyed by our government <Laughter>
by your shoes
You said by your shoes
"Your shoes don't show that I've traveled a little bit, I've somehow traveled, I haven't traveled in a while."
"Oh, just <sigh>"
It's...
it helps you keep things in the perspective of our lives here
It's exciting and it makes me feel
I really live because sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and we see other places where you realize that
"You know, life is about a lot of different things you don't think every day"
"Well, um..."
one of my trips I went uh
I went to
singapure and then to thailand
And it was when I was with my ex-boyfriend and we went around
he had <ha> he was uh
uh
a sales engineer
"or system engineer, but he did well this year and so this was kind of like a company thing, so we went to singapore for a few days"
and that was really interesting to you know of course
eh
"It's a lot different over there, not just like going to Canada or something."
"but they had a big reception in the evening we arrived there and they had like a piece of the directors of the company, which was really fun and"
um
after singapore uh we have some tours in singapore it was really
"it was an interesting experience, it's really clean there and it's really"
"There's not much crime, but the government is very, it's a little intrusive"
but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost < almo> it was really completely different because it is like jungle
We went to
It's a small island.
and it was just it was very
Primitives compared to
"singapore only in a lot of different ways, but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap"
had a beach massage for eight dollars <Laughter>
it was interesting yeah
"Yes, it was an hour for eight dollars <Laughter>"
mm
"Well, I'm in school right now."
I didn't finish school when I was younger because I...
I had health problems.
So around here I am
I'm doing my General Ed. I'm going to s_m_c.
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm happy
"ooh <sigh> well, my dream job would be <sigh> a vet"
"but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know, also because of the monetarly it costs a lot, but that would be my dream job working with animals and and"
in veterinary capacity
"Yeah, that's good."
I think I'm right at the top around it depends on the environment and the people I'm with and
"how comfortable I am, but around I'm really going out when I'm comfortable with people and I'm really being reserved <Laughter> if I don't"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Well, I mean next to sleeping"
um
I like
like relaxing things uh like going for a bike tour on the strand
Or when I'm home uh just like reading or
many times I can just lie there and
"my mind could do things, but I'm kind of relaxing"
"Oh, really good."
I didn't
I'd say there are certain things that...
they can really
how to make me
like when I see injustices or such things
"I mean, I can really feel it"
but I never like flying out of the grip or throwing things or
You know you're screaming.
argued
To <sigh>
I can't really say that I have arguments that I mean like a disagreement or an actual argument.
Like if we just
All right.
I'd say last summer.
if:
um
I think it was after a
Baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to
we went to have Shabu Shabu after the game
and
I don't know that I think
Scrubbed_entry
And I don't know it's some kind of tough friendship.
She's in a way a good friend and she's in mm we're actually somehow removed in other ways so I don't consider her
Like someone I'd confide in and you know if someone
"deep problems, but..."
Sometimes we just...
She's very sensitive.
and she doesn't have the same sense of humor I do
So I think
"she had told me a few things that somehow bothered me that night, but mm"
You know I'm just kind of
That's just how she is
and then I guess I said some things they
have been felted
"Oh, well, she's really getting"
"Slightly offended I think <Laughter> but around after that we didn't talk for a while, but then we"
Then she called me and then we were friends again
But as she never confronted me
Difficultest decision <sigh>
It left my ex-boyfriend.
All right.
It wasn't
"It's been a long time coming, I mean, I've been thinking about it"
for as five years
um
"You know, he wasn't like he hit me or something that he was a really good guy, but we..."
had a lot to
we <w> we were not always on the same wavelength and we had a lot of same disagreements
so I had thought about it and thought about it and
"We've been engaged, but we've been together a long time."
I don't know.
I was always it was always on my head how should I get married or should I not and then finally
Anyway we were just always with
um
We've always been what the word I'm looking for is.
We just had this little sniffer
Inconsistencies all the time and then one day we had one and I just decided that I would go and
That's what I did.
it was really hard it was the hardest
Decision in my life and I can stay that definitely
and
but I think it was the best
Deep breath probably leaving my job
for good to help my friend start a business in Nevada
and if i if i
"I liked my job, I mean, it was pretty good, um, it was right on the beach."
"and when I told them that I was leaving, they offered me this huge increase and they offered me another position that was awesome"
and that was really stressful for me because
"I had already promised that my friend <Laughter> would go, I wouldn't have gotten the position you could offer if it wasn't"
Because she wants me to come over there.
it was really stressful and I stressed about it for about three weeks until I actually went
and
When I went there
as if we had made agreements on how much they would pay me and bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
"When I got there, she didn't remember telling me that I needed a certain amount and"
the other directors of the company were
You know the <th>
"It was a difficult situation because she had spoken to me, but they hadn't spoken to me and they're like good, that's too much"
and also
they were another religion
"and it was very strange I mean, they were all a religion <Laughter> I was surrounded by Mormons and I have nothing against Mormons, but it was very different because anyway"
I was kind of an outsider and then
also the weather was just it was absolutely terrible there <Laughter>
So I'd say that's a decision it's making
It's just a central point in my life and I think that around
I really wish I had just stayed
"Well, if you wipe something out of my memory, I'd probably say,"
my memory
"like really, if I could erase something from my memory that I want to delete"
Is that what you say?
mm < sigh>
I can't think of anything.
also like this
the bad decision I made
"You know, it's worth it, so I can't really say that I'd want to erase something I mean maybe if I raped like or something"
"and it was really appalling then I would, but I didn't"
"Being in a deep sleep I am in a deep sleep a lot, but"
"I never feel rested, and that's..."
It's a medical problem for me.
I always feel good
as if I hadn't slept for two days and
um
there are points in the day
I would say in some < s> during some days there are points in the day where I really feel awake and alive and
"and rested, but they are short-lived"
But I sleep a lot I sleep
Uh pretty fucked up <Laughter> physically pretty fucked up
"Yeah, that's good."
Good thanks <Laughter>
no
"I wasn't officially diagnosed with depression, but..."
This is
That's usually what doctors do
um
"As if my sleep problem has not yet been diagnosed, I am in the process of real work to get it diagnosed, but this is the first thing they try and"
"They've given me depression drugs before, but they didn't help me sleep."
But I do.
I would say I sometimes feel down <someti> good
"my life is very strange right now, so there are a lot of reasons to feel down"
um
I would say that sometimes I feel depressed.
"many times, but it's not"
I'd say
It's reasonable to think about.
the situations in which I am in
They are only triggered by the fact that my health is not great and it makes life really difficult
But...
I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything special.
"Oh, there I mean you mean for a long time or I mean I feel happy when I go out with friends or I go and you know I have"
Find some great new dish I like I mean
what kind of happiness you're looking for
To <sigh>
All right.
"I mean, right now..."
"My girlfriend just had surgery, so I'm staying with her this week."
"I really enjoy it, I mean, though"
"We could never live together, I could never live with her long-term life and I'm sure she couldn't live with me long-term, but I'm having fun and..."
You know they're just them I installed the Groupon app on her ah on her phone
Yesterday
Because she paid too much for laser hair removal.
"<Laughter> and so I installed it on her phone and then today she's looking for cupcakes, so she let me pick cupcakes up on the way here to get back to her uh as a groupon deal, so I mean,"
You know there are such funny little things.
"Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh..."
It's probably due to
o_c_d <laughter> and around
She probably thinks I'm pretty prissy compared to her
um
I think that they
Tell me I have a good heart.
um
and probably that I am
I should ask her <Laughter> uh
"I don't know we're going out, so she'd say I'm having fun."
"Um, but..."
She mentioned that I am a very private person and that I know that I knew before she said that
Why?
I've got <ha> good I told you I've got a lot of problems right now
and <sigh>
So I don't really know
People tell about them
um
It's a kind of
"It's a kind of Killjoy, but also"
People can feel I feel that people can feel
less comfortable when they realize that you are having trouble and they feel somehow
um
"it's just uncomfortable as oh they might need to help them or they feel guilty, but they have good busy lives so somehow creates a gap, but I'd say even before"
Even before this difficult time in my life I was
"I was a private person, I don't know why."
"I think, <thi> I think a lot"
"Oh, you know, I'm a deep thinker"
and
Maybe it's just
you know
"don't feel like I'm abnormal, but"
um
Maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that
"don't seem appropriate to share with people, or I'm not sure"
10 or 20 years ago <sigh>
um
"Well, one thing I regret now is..."
You know I didn't really find
Someone
"You know, spending the rest of my life with it so I'd tell myself to focus more on it, because once you've met forty, it's really <rea> it's a lot harder"
That's it.
I would say <sigh>
that I have perservered
I'm very proud that
even if I have a lot of
Difficulties in My Life
the fact that I am you know that this commitment to go to school
And I'll do it alone
and
You know that it
It's a kind of
"when people, when people knew all the problems I have"
"They'd be good, you know why you're worried about school, but..."
I really feel that.
"You know, I'm doing this and I'm really proud that even through everything around I get one"
Thank you.
mm k
Thank you.
See you.
