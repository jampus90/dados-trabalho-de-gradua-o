"also like to play tennis when I can not be able to play lately, although due to physical problems"
um
mm
It's just that...
I had hurt my ankle because I had anaemia <anenia> and
and I got dizzy one night and fell on my ankle and on my leg and so I'm just waiting for this to really heal
"But I plan to come back to tennis, it's one of the things I enjoy doing, really relaxes me"
"I really have no temperament over the years, I've learned how to control it."
"Probably it would have been yesterday, but there was no argument."
and what it was about
nothing I can remember <Laughter>
something I feel guilty about
hm
There's nothing I feel guilty about right now.
mm
"Oh, a situation I wish I'd treated differently"
I really can't imagine anyone right now.
the toughest decision oh
um
the absolutely toughest decision I've ever had to make
um
was when my uh I twins twins twins twins twins boys they've grown now
I had twins
Twin teen teen teen
and I had lost my job and we lived in a motel
and
the rent for the motel was outrageous I couldn't pay any more the
"In order to pay for the kind of money they wanted, I had to pay for it."
um
Put my son under the nursing ward for a minute.
that was the hardest decision I had to make
Scrubbed_entry
around a schizophrenic
and he had
"He was born with an auditory processing deficit, which he overcame by training with a speech therapist and school official, and he also lost his hearing when he was four years old."
"Um, but..."
"and then, when he became fourteen, schizophrenia came"
"So he's in a supportive environment right now, where he's twenty-seven years old."
But he's settled with his mental illness and now he accepts it.
"I had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication you'd give him, and he hid it, put it in his pocket or whatever."
"Well, but he got along with it, and we all got along with it, and he's doing him pretty good."
Scrubbed_entry
"The son is twenty, he's seven, as I said, because he's a twin."
um
um lived in texas with his wife
And he got a promotion to...
Scrubbed_entry
"Now he's in California, both of them in California."
um
I feel very good about the yeah
uh
hm
good from adult children yes
<Laughter> of adult children yes
No No No No No No No
"No, I'll take that back."
"not it's not hard to be a parent of adults of my adult children okay when they were younger, there were difficult times okay difficult periods and around"
"It was also a lot of good times, but yes, there were some difficult times."
mm
"Well, the mm the difficult times that I've really been alluding to a lot and that was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and"
and
they were in
Temporary and
in the good one was in the care and one was actually in an institution because of the about the schizophrenia
um
so
think I've lost track of the question <Laughter>
the hardest part about being a parent
"at this point at this point in my life, there's nothing serious about it."
um
the best thing about being a parent
"I don't know, I guess it's just to see <Cough>"
"something you created to develop into a pretty decent person you know, a decent person."
That's the best.
"Oh, many ways"
"Well, actually."
"I didn't have two parents, I had a mother."
and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I had no contact with him around
but the thing I do
unlike what my mother did
um
she was a strong disciplinary
both oral and physical
um
and
she at her had this tendency that she grew out of
"She had this tendency to be very critical, okay critical and..."
to oppose <Laughter> and very religious
um
and somehow
"I looked at people who weren't, and that was me as if they were"
were life wrong because they did not go to church or read the Bible and this kind of thing
what was the other part
on the question
"I don't sleep well or I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's that that's all there is if I don't take medication, I don't sleep, I'll be awake all night I'll be awake"
I'll be up for days if I don't take medication.
Man irritable around
and tired <Laughter>
All right.
lately
"You know, just a little scared really around"
"You know, I just..."
made a move to a new apartment it is a lot of cost and
"new issues and things like that you know and new furniture and new this and that that you have to do all this, but"
The whole thing was kind of stressful.
yes mhm
no p_t_s_d
Yes
"Um, that was back in I think two thousand and four"
um
because my life had become so stressful
up to the point where:
it was either I had to do something or
or stop something to tell you the truth yeah
"Um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,"
"Yes, I think it's useful to you to know as a good sounding record"
You know someone to throw
"You know, your concerns and you know, discuss things that bother you or good things to yes, I think therapy with medications"
um
Since I went to therapy
In order to make the changes
a lot of changes to
I was more focused.
more
Hopeful
um
hm
"it was just a good experience for me, which is why I keep going"
Really Happy
All right.
I can feel really happy
"I can't think of anything about an incident right now, just like that."
and then
I go back to what I felt
So I really can't determine exactly what I mean.
"anyway I mean, if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right, unlike things that go wrong all the time"
"that it makes me happy if things go right, how about"
hm
mm something I've done recently
that I really
something I did recently that I really enjoyed
my really really enjoyed
Recently
hm
I can't think of anything.
I don't have a best friend.
to my best qualities
are that:
I'm an honest person.
I really give people the benefit of doubt
to all in my book
is what they seem to be
until they prove it's different
um
I'm very generous.
Too generous <Laughter>
um
and I'm very fond of helping other people
"I mean, help me that I'm on a personal level to help people."
"You know what their problem is, I enjoy doing something for someone else that helps them,"
mhm
everything I regret
How is that possible?
There's only one thing I regret and that's that
um
After my twins became old enough to
start to the school of primary school level around
I took a few courses as a pre-law major.
and
At that time I was married to her father
who has proved not to be good
fit for me
and
because of the burdens associated with him
You know this would end and I'd leave him.
um
I left college.
so that was my greatest regret
hm
"stay in school, no matter what"
"stay the course, no matter what"
that I'm a good person
I'm a good person
That's all.
All right.
Goodbye.
