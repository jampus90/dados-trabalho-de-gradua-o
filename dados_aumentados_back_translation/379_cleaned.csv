value
Yes
I feel okay little tired but for the most part feels pretty good
I'm actually originally from forest hills that I was born in the San Fernando Valley
"and then I moved to lomita, which is in loose circle"
ca. mm probably by nineteen ninety three so I mean I'm now twenty-three so
It's about what yeah nineteen years or so I've lived there yeah
"some things I really like, I'd have to say, you know,"
the beach
You know.
"not so much traffic doesn't really care about it, but it does."
"In any case, you know exactly how the nightlife is."
just people in general I like talking to others so yeah
Right
yep
"Yeah, actually, I mean, I can't see your shoes, but, um, actually, I travel a lot"
I was in places like Hawaii.
was on the Caribbean
I was seeing at uh times <machte sound with mouth>
You only know different places like
"Arizona, I was in Oregon Washton."
pretty everywhere I would say so but usually especially as to hawaii and the caribbean mexico so
yep <free throat>
I think it's just the experience you know as if you couldn't experience culture.
to different people you only know the whole background of the landscape
"It's just that you know it's something new to experience, I'd say"
"something you know that people haven't seen yet, so"
"Well, let's see, I recently made a trip to Hawaii a few months ago, which was back in December it was Christmas time"
new years so that was pretty fun we went to a few different islands
"We went to uh see, I think it was Kauai going to oahu"
uh maui You know places like this so
yep
You know I'd have to say that
"around you probably know like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean you know, just like I said before the whole experience factor"
just look around you know new different things things that are unique so
"Yeah, that's good."
"I'm studying journalism right now, I'm in my last semester"
So I'm over <bout> until graduation couple of months
yep
"Well, you know, it's kind of funny because you know that I started a two-year community college at a... you know."
"And so you know, I went into uh like business management know something to do with you, I think, < Thin> basically about accounting"
But I thought it wasn't for me.
"So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't say that I would probably still be sitting at a desk, but"
"You know, at least with journalism, I can go to the field and you know, talk to people, and you know,"
"Arta you know, get information collecting information that Arta Deal and then you know write stories"
"I just thought it was you know it was much more interesting to me, unlike you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so"
yep
"My dream job, I'd have to say you know something on the radio show."
"Sport transmission, you know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine."
so
my relationship with my family it's pretty good you know I'm still living with my parents
"as I said, I am twenty-three years old"
"There are times when it can be a little shaky, a little stony, but..."
"For the most part, it's pretty good that you know I've matured a lot in recent years."
"Things are, uh, you know"
I'd say things are going pretty well.
"You know, I think it's coming somewhere in the middle"
"You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and relaxed"
"other times I somehow it's not as much as I go into my bowl, but"
You know sometimes how I can be kind of shy when I don't know people so well or when I've never met them before
"So it's one of those things that somehow you have to meet me in the middle of it, because you know,"
I can either talk very talkatively
"or sometimes you know I can be a little shy, but you know, once I get this conversation started, I'm pretty talkative and"
so
"Um, you usually know, um..."
I would listen to music
or maybe you just know that you're kind of going on a ride
"Or you know you're hanging out with my friends, you just know something to know somehow."
"Lightness that you know because you know how I said, sometimes you get a bit tense and you just want to relax and you know only the things you enjoy"
so
You know I was really better with it.
"A few years ago, you know that I"
"There were points where I could pretty much not control my temperament, however, as <li> I mean, I would just"
"pretty angry at you know the smallest things that everything would just tick me off somehow, but"
"You know, I definitely learned, uh you know, control over this kind of thing"
And you know it made me a better person because it burns my throat.
"Well, let's see, I'm trying to think it was probably something with my family with my mother, maybe it's I can't remember from the top of my head, but"
"You know, it's always something so miniscule that"
That's probably why I don't remember.
"But you know we're gonna make up for this sometime, and I apologize because you know I accept that."
You know I'm wrong under certain circumstances.
"Yeah, that's good."
something I feel guilty about
"Maybe you know that I'm not as nice to others as I could have been in the past, you know, and that's the past, and you know, I don't like staying in this way"
"but I think this is one thing that I've tried to work on, but it's also one thing that I regret somehow, not just do, just be nice"
The hardest decision I ever had to make uh it was pretty new
a little hard because I actually have a buddy who was in the Luftwaffe and he recently
"diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia, so that was really hard"
And it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not quite there the way he used to be.
"So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm ignoring him and I don't want to do that, but at the same time I don't know his tendencies."
He could be a little bit.
Crazy
so
"Maybe you know some kind of traumatic stress disorder, maybe when he was in the military, so I don't know, but yes."
"Yeah, it's pretty hard, you know, because we've been back a long time."
were best friends with him because I was probably about five six years old
"So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to handle, but you know, I'm trying to"
I don't know.
"Try to stay in mind, but you know it's always there, I don't forget, so yeah"
My best friend
"Well, he would probably say that you know I'm a pretty pretty guy."
"Usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest, but you know I'm trying to work on it too"
He'd probably say I'm pretty funny.
I like hanging out with you.
Mode
Doing things here and there that you only know
normal activities like any other person you know going to the beach hanging out movies that you know grab a few beers that kind of deal so yeah
<freezes the throat
"You know, it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know when I'm really tired, you know, I'm probably going to have a very good sleep"
"I haven't slept so well in the last few days, because you know,"
"My house, there's workers on the roof, so use the new roof, so it's kind of tough."
"so that wakes me always early in the morning so sometimes a little crabby, but for the most part"
I usually get a pretty good sleep <empty throat>
lately eh
You've felt pretty good because you know things are starting to look up.
I actually did an internship about <bout> a month ago
"for you know, my field of journalism, so that's good to graduate in two months, so I'm looking forward to,"
"To make a little more money, you know that's good"
"and yes, things are going pretty well right now, I can't complain < clears throat>"
"Yeah, it's not bad that you know how I said it could always be worse right, but"
"You know, I enjoy life, so it's the best part"
I have not been going on
no
Yes
no
Last time I felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> You know it was probably back to my buddy when you know that he was still
I guess you could say we know he came back to visit the Air Force he had left.
So you know we were just hanging out
"You know I have a few beers and I'm just talking about life, so it was nice, but I miss you knowing."
I felt great that you know
"For there is nothing like having a best friend that can be entertained, whom you can know twenty-four seven above all."
"can tell him everything in confidence, and he could tell me everything in confidence, how"
"It's hard to find that you especially know someone you've known for so many years, and then you can't really get it back now."
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yes, there's one, there's probably one or two things I regret"
"Well, I mean, I regret having a d_u_i over"
"Three or four years ago, actually, it was four years ago, so that's something I definitely regret because you know that I look back on it and you know that things might have been different, but at the same time"
You have to accept that you know the actions you know.
which has taken place
"So you know, I'm manned and you know, I think I think I'm better off for it"
"But at the same time, you know it will always be in the back of your mind, as I said."
It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way.
"Now you know, it's one of those things like <Laughter> I was a kid then, so I really don't know what to say, even though"
"I would have listened, who knows, but you know that I probably would have told myself that you knew exactly."
"Be careful, you know."
Make sure you can be the best person you may be
um
"basically you know, just always be nice honest"
"to take care only of others, so"
to probably get back to my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing
"I'm not saying that I wish I could erase it I just wish it didn't happen like this, so"
"Yeah, that's good."
my ideal weekend uh I usually keep it pretty generic I tend to hang out with my friends
Either you know we're hanging out in the day
"You know that certain things like you know, maybe grab a few beers"
to you know you just have casual entertainment maybe play games movies look you know only the standard stuff that people do this
some things I wish I could change
um
Maybe you just know you're nicer than I said before.
um
Maybe not to be so lazy have more determination
"I mean, I have a lot of determination, I know what I want to do with my life."
But I know there are times when I'm kind of
get a little laxadaisical so I wish I could improve on that and not delay so much
"Well, you know, it's hard to think back"
but I would probably say a time when someone is making me feel really bad you know
I'd say like if I was you know kind of angry at certain people maybe just kind of chew my friends if I probably shouldn't
"I have tried to make more constructive criticisms, but"
at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say these kinds of things and
"they were out of character, so"
my best qualities I would say that I'm definitely working hard I'm sure
I'm very caring now
more than I used to be
very honest
And you know I love talking to people
I like to make new relationships
I like to make people laugh <empty throat>
something I did recently that I really enjoyed
"You know, it was probably about my internship, I was just you know I wrote a story or two."
"and it just felt good that you know these stories are done and eventually they're going to go to the newspaper, so"
I feel that way.
You know it's one of those things when you're working on something and then you see the product right there
"You know it's right in your face, and you can tell yourself that you know how I did it."
so
makes me feel good yep
"You know, let's just see some different stories."
"usually things about good the newspaper is in long beach, so it's usually about you stories or events that take place in long beach, so yeah"
I'd say I'm very proud that you know the degree.
Gymnasium about to graduate from college
hopefully you know obviously that I'm earning a degree and then hopefully you get to know a good solid job
You know in the near future
I think this is one thing I'm most proud of
Thank you.
