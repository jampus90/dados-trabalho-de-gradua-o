value
I'm fine.
I'm originally from California
uh born in Glendale
I'm not so happy with that.
just unemployed at the moment but uh
active in search of uh
Uh do what I'm supposed to do uh there's some uh
"some prospects there, but hopefully I'll learn something today"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Well, I have one, it's a girlfriend, so I consider her a roommate a lover type thing"
Excuse me.
We're pretty close.
Uh I met her last year and uh
We've been through something.
"Disturbing times, but we begin to see a light at the end of the tunnel"
uh
the disturbing times
uh
I would
Let me see uh
All right.
"I got a D_u_i last year and lost my job, I'm a truck driver by trade so"
Such a way
threw me far away uh with a fourteen hundred dollars a week job uh and then go to nothing like plus losing my license somehow threw me away really
and I couldn't get around
I didn't really uh
"I found everything I was interested in, so I started cooking."
and we try to see which other route I can go as far as uh a kind of career and uh
so
"I decide to go to the culinary field, but, you know, I still have to work, it's hard to find work with uh without going to school."
and uh so
"But I think I applied to Ralphs today, so I hope I get the job I should actually have, so..."
um
"but I'm starting to see a light, as I said at the end of the tunnel, now a little bit gradually"
my dream job would probably be a forest service
out in the wilderness yeah
I like being alone
Excuse me.
All right.
"You know, I have a lot for animals I'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and I like it, I don't like people too much"
"Uh so being out and uh I've always enjoyed being out, that's how I'm a truck driver I've traveled the world"
I don't like being in a warehouse or an office.
outdoor kind of guy so
one of my trips would be uh
I spent a year and a half in Japan and uh on the lower island uh there that they built this bridge
uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh
I was there to work.
uh for a very white oh uh a very white tiger act and uh working for a Japanese circus
"So it was interesting that many people on this island didn't really see many Americans, because that was also one of the islands we bombed."
"So there was a lot of negativity, but I've got quite a good idea, you know, outlook uh on life uh especially during the times you know i"
I enjoyed it that you know.
through all the travel and meeting new people and to eat you know different around different foods and uh it was a good experience for me
"all the experience was pretty good for me you know, just traveling around with circuses and uh"
You know it was great.
uh
likely
a few of the things I like about l_a
There's not much I like about l_a but
"I like Hollywood, I like the film industry."
the uh huge uh
um
different people you know differently uh
different ethnicities of uh people here you know uh
I enjoy talking to some people who know many foreigners I like to see where they came from and what it looks like there.
The traffic is horrible
you know
Transport < slaughter>
Uh ignorance uh
be disrespectful uh disrespectful or whatever you know other people disrespecting you or other people
um
That's it.
dishonesty
Excuse me.
Uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know I drive the bus a lot so uh
"You know, or I, when I ride my bike, uh"
"People tend to drive me almost over, so if I don't pay attention to the traffic all the time, uh you know I find myself sometimes"
You know you have to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of having the right to go or something like that.
Yeah big time
What do I do if I'm angry?
um
"I'm probably sitting there, sitting there, airing, you know, I speak my opinion, even if I'm often myself, you know exactly how you know assholes or whatever you are."
"Now you know, I carry stones in my back pocket, so I can know it's happening so much where I'm just I'm just surprised about what people do sometimes you know that you almost know about everything you know, I'll probably almost run over probably on a daily basis"
"And if I don't watch, I'd be in the shit stream."
It's hard to deal with people who are particularly trying not to respond because there are consequences for your reactions.
It was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest.
I'm pretty honest with
I am open and honest about everything and everything
and uh
"what it was about uh just she lied to me to uh told me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something and that and this aspect and I come to find out a week later that it was a total lie, so I just"
You know that didn't like it at all.
Excuse me.
um
I'm trying to miss the word for it.
"just that I don't know now if I could believe everything she's saying now, so it was uh"
"I felt hurt you know, uh, you know that here we're in a relationship for a little and good, that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is being honest"
um
I don't like that I said I'm not holding back and I'm pretty honest in everything and everything I do or say so
you know and if you lie about something good
You always have to cover up.
more lies with the lies you've already told and I just
"You don't see anyone you know, so somehow it took a lot of me to trust her now, or you know whatever I am, you know, it's true it's not you know, so it's somehow hurt our relationship"
There's nothing I can do about it.
Uh fun i
how to go to the beach uh
"I love shooting darts, but I haven't done it in a while I love to paint uh I get in watercolor painting"
and I'm pretty gifted about it and around
uh i want to try some other media and uh let's see here i love fishing
I haven't been gone in a long time.
and uh
"I like driving a truck, you know, it's my job, you know, I was a really enjoyed it I don't like driving through cities, but uh usually when I'm in the middle of the night where I can see all the stars I like stars I'll see if I'm looking around"
Pick some of them.
Astronomy uh stars up there and around
"I'm a pretty easy guy to go, so shoot pool around"
Sunshine only
which I like
Uh most memorable experiences around
Good or bad
uh
the most memorable experiences
Probably.
Play with lions and tigers uh
To wrestle a baby elephant in a mud puddle
uh
I'm just enjoying myself.
I know
not
I don't have much family as it is
uh
"At least here in the States, I'm not from Central America."
But I'm not close to I've got uh
three brothers a sister
and I'm probably not really close to any of my siblings
I'm talking to a brother
"Uh, a little..."
"my other youngest brother you know he just I would rather not know that I'm talking to him, but it's you know, only I'm trying to keep it on a professional basis my sister I'm not talking to at all my other brother among me"
"I haven't spoken to him in years, so I'm just near my mother, uh, my niece."
a few of my nephews and that's it.
I've done everything I can to avoid it
um
to avoid them
"Uh yeah, I just don't talk to them I don't call them I don't ask for them I know, I'm talking to my mother pretty bit of my brother a little bit, but I just don't mention these topics or when they're being raised I usually say that you know it's on them and I really don't want to deal with them so"
"It's been hard lately, it was probably hard for the last uh"
goes to one year
You know that I...
depends on my thinking process at the time I said I was looking for work.
So just...
wonder why you know I'm not gonna be called I just mean I have racing thoughts
so 
or I'm getting depressed you know because I or I'm worried about things you know that really I don't control
so
I don't know.
"lately I just slept a little too much uh at least for me because I'm so used to sleeping only four to five hours per night, but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and I'm still tired"
lately I've probably spent the last few months
um
tired <Laughter>
I know.
"Sometimes when I don't sleep well, I just stay with the same things that bothered me so you know that I'm more of a guy you know, I love working."
um
"and if I'm not, it's just a little too much time for me to spend in my own head"
And so
You know.
i there i either when I'm busy or i do what i know you're in what job i kind of know you get it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me
and uh
So I can remember that you're either working or thinking at home and then thinking about knowing that I don't have to worry.
You know about money
"You know, bills are paid and I can just focus on other things, either you know, do the things I like, or"
Maybe spend a little more time with my girlfriend or something like that
How do I do something?
How can I deal with them?
um
I just...
"Don't try to think about it, it's not about whether you can handle it or not."
I just do it's uh
I'm more of a guy who just
"You know, it may take a moment for"
to the
"saying that I'm done with something, but you know, it's when I don't have control over it, there's nothing I can really do, the only thing I can do is control what I do and that's actively looking for work to go active on uh interviews"
I'm talking to others about work so I can somehow know that I'm going back to...
"back to the basics You know that I just don't allow a lot of things to bother me, it bothers me but I'm not trying to keep it bothering me"
when what got me in trouble
my mood swings I mean
um
Yes money I mean you know my past I have a past so uh the kind of tends to uh
"I don't know if I'm hired, so I have to deal with different employers who"
uh say uh crime friendly and uh uh stuff like that and I'm trying to tell you I've been teaching on uh
"on uh how to interview, how to uh"
"how to answer some of the questions you know, come pretty a little and uh"
"I'm kind of thinking about it, but I have to keep pretending that this isn't the one that"
"who I want to be more like this or you know, I've done"
uh
I did it.
"I have done my time so to say, but I took the time you know the last time I took only a lot of time and"
and try to uh work on
the problems that have bothered me so much
"You know what's positive, I've been thinking about my g_e_d differences many classes around uh uh going to school, I didn't go to school."
and uh
anything that would somehow change my old ways and uh and try to move on to more productive activities
Excuse me.
I still haven't heard you.
the
the people are deceptive
Can you repeat that once again
All right.
I was diagnosed with bipolarism.
um
It's hard if you don't know.
"I'm not medication, so I mean, I used to take medication, but, um..."
"again I try to live from life uh I try to live life according to the conditions of life and I just know,"
I know that the medical institutions always want to label something and
"And what I don't like about it is that they're just experimenting with pills, you know, I was probably on every imaginable pill there is and around"
you know
some of them were too strong or some of them were not strong enough and
So I just try to deal with things uh
It's just my life skills you know I don't want I don't want to work with drugs I know certain drugs work for as three to four months six months and then they go well here I'll try you on this and or I'll try you on that and it's just an ongoing process and I'll probably go for about the last two years
"For about three years, I said that you know what that is, and..."
whether it's different than if I'd be on top drugs for it
I don't think so you know it's still the same stuff that I'm still getting the same problems and I'm still
uh get the same fear as if I was on medication for it or not so I just
"and I'll deal with it you know, sometimes it's not good, you know that I get very irritated with people I don't like people"
"I don't like crowds, I don't know how disgusting people like huge empty rest"
um
"But I'm getting a person you know it's not that personality, but I think people can see me and just say that you're not messing with this guy or you know..."
"but still you know, I like driving public transport quite a bit and around"
"You know you have a lot of disgusting people on it, sometimes I have to get off the bus."
That's how I deal with people because I know there are consequences if I didn't deal with them like that.
So I just let it go.
I'd rather take the time to leave the bus and wait for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad
had a problem before I quit
uh
I don't know if I knew I had a problem before I found out I knew other people.
um
"I have a lot of ups and downs, so I know a lot in my younger days people would tell me that you know when I told them that I was diagnosed with you know bipolar that around"
"Many remarks were like oh, that's what's wrong, you know that was what was wrong with you, we want you to have found that years ago"
"I don't think the drugs really work, but what I do, I think, um, um, um, um, as you know, just getting older."
Type of uh
"You know it works, you know it"
I'm so in contact with life
Excuse me.
Uh I talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while
"Um, recently"
"And it helps a lot what you know just to erase my anger, uh my thoughts..."
"many people may not understand, but uh"
a therapist is
"I think the bigger thing is that I can just figure it out, whatever it is for me, whether it's uh."
People you know uh
uh
"other problems you know were whatever may be the case, I just think to talk about it and they are so good listeners and can somehow like"
You know they're giving me the same advice you know I'm giving myself or whatever I'm giving to others.
But it's always helpful to hear it from someone else who
"will be a you know you know they're going to school for this, so you know"
but it's good to have
"Yeah, that's good."
"Well, I'm not going around like that anymore"
I kind of miss that you know how I said uh
uh
"I really miss it, but uh"
"It's just one of those things that you know I'm just acting so you know, uh after you know if I'll ever get a chance to go back to therapy I'll probably"
To good monetary reasons and uh
"You know, I don't have health insurance, there's a lot of things you want to know, but I can't tell you,"
"You know, money situation isn't so great right now so"
how my friends describe me
um
they would probably describe me as uh
uh energetic uh outgoing person uh as soon as I get to know people
um
I laugh you know I laugh I laugh a lot
um
But...
they would probably tell you that I'm also very serious and uh
uh
"hidden person I don't reveal much you know,"
and uh so
Someone who had a positive influence in my life
Someone who...
Someone who had a positive influence in my life
Uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when I started with uh
"with exotic animals he really was, you know, he was uh"
Uh german and um
they have not been taking place
"I don't know what he saw in me, but"
He taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and...
showed a lot of trust in me and that in it also built trust in me
and uh
Let me know that you know there's nothing I really can't achieve when I imagine it.
you know
"Yeah, that's it."
You're welcome.
to <Laughter>
