value
Yes
I'm doing good.
I'm originally from Southern California
I like the downtown theater district I like the beaches I like the variety of things you can do in a day
hmm
good sometimes I don't like traffic
I don't think there's really too much I don't like.
"No, I didn't really travel in about five years."
"Oh, I was just not able to travel around"
I just didn't travel <Laughter>
I like to go to new places and see things I've never seen before and if I like to visit.
Places like landmarks
"Well, the last thing I did was San Francisco, that wasn't ready, but I had to stay in downtown San Francisco and I had to go shopping."
and I had to get on one to get the road car so that was cool
xxx
"Well, I'm still studying, I'm studying psychology"
mhm
hmm
Good <sigh>
"I decided to go back to school, just pretty fast, so I went to junior college"
"And then, when it came close to graduation, I knew that I wanted to transfer so"
"I had taken some psychology classes and I decided I liked it, so I decided to do my major"
and it
I thought it didn't have much math but it had
enough math <Laughter> so
< deep breath> mm <sigh> good now that I'm almost done
I don't know if I'm going to continue in this area.
"Well, what I originally wanted was to get <sigh> into sports psychology, but I'm not"
"I'm sure that's what I want, either"
All right.
"I could be shy at first, but as soon as you meet me, I'm going out."
<sigh> I think I'm either going to sleep eating something really good or watching something on netflix
good only a good movie I like foreign movies a lot about so much
Right now I'm in about Martial Arts movie with subtitles so
I think I'm pretty good
hmm
You know I know.
They're not really long arguments I don't know if they're real arguments I know I argued with my friend around <Laughter> because he hung up in my face but I don't know why and it was solved pretty quickly so I don't know if it was really so important
"Wait, I went out without saying, oh okay"
hmm
I can't think of one right now.
I think
the hardest decision I probably had to make
he moved
from good back to California from Oregon
"Well, I was really young, so I was..."
"nineteen twenty-ish and I was really alone, so that was pretty hard, because obviously I had to support myself"
"because it was really boring in Oregon, so I like the activity here in l_a"
You know I don't really feel guilty about many things.
"Well, I'm not talking to them so much about my dad my stepmother living in Oregon so I'm probably talking to them on the phone at least once or twice a month"
"and then, when they come here, I want to say, at least once a year sometimes it can be known twice more occasionally, but not too often then I see them"
um
"that's it, but I'm pretty much the only one out here my brother's also up there"
"Yeah, that's good."
hmm
"Well, I had a lot of positive influences I think about"
"Just normal people I know, maybe someone I've worked with, maybe"
"My uncle is really a good positive influence, he knows he has a lot of good advice."
mm about <bout> life
hmm
"You know, I don't really think something so bad happened to me where I just didn't uh"
where it bothers me so much that I don't have to think about it
Pretty <pret>
"Well, I can't say quite simply because I work strange schedule and then I go to school, but..."
"Yeah, if I want to sleep, I sleep really well, but as long as I have enough, you know, hours."
really really happy and good
Yes
no
I'm always happy uh <Laughter> God yesterday
"I'm always happy when I talk to my friend, or when I go out and do something, I'm just happy, I'm from work, I'm happy because I'm done for the day, I'm just really happy"
"I'm in the spring break, I'm really happy now."
oh I haven't done like any really extreme fun activities unless you're considering going to eat
but the last activity
that I had a lot of fun doing ice skating around downtown in downtown l_a in December
"No, I don't really have too much regret, I mean, whatever happens and you know it was meant to play like that."
hmm
"Well, um..."
I guess I'd say don't worry about those little things.
"Although they really seem big, they're really insignificant and uh"
You won't think about it in six months.
I think my
best qualities are I'm a happy person I'm a funny person I'm pretty easy to get with I think most people like me
And I'm just a cool person
"Well, I wish I could study more I wish I would study more"
I wish I'd train more.
and I wish that was
"Yeah, I think that's it."
hmm
I don't think I want to talk about it.
hmm
"I don't know, I guess I just care about supporting myself don't go back home I think that's about the best performance there is"
Thank you.
See you.
