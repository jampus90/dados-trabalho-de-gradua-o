value
<sync>
sure
in a day uh pretty well except for drab weather
originally i'm from detroit michigan
yes
uh back in the eighties
yeah
uh it's been a while the last time uh it's been about five years
<laughter> uh not even close uh
<sigh> more setback uh out here it's you know you have the weather that's that's that's prominent <pr> prominent reason for coming is the weather
it does uh well maybe better opportunities
uh and the weather <laughter>
yes <sigh>
it took a minute uh had to adjust to <tisk> the uh
different attitudes of the people
the surroundings
the locations and the
vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another
um
well
the weather uh for one the never end uh uh uh it never snows in in southern california
uh two uh
the prospects of uh uh starting out a business or becoming uh
self-employed and
doing what i like to do
the people
they're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know uh back east and i'm from uh i was raised in the south
where everybody is uh cordial friendly hi when you pass in the streets out here
people think that you have uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing
so
that's what i don't like about l_a
used to uh i used to be on the road a lot i was a a truck driver and plus uh a entertainment uh coach driver for several
uh motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yes yeah
well this is a beautiful <beau> this is actually a beautiful country so just
viewing uh uh the countryside uh visiting different towns different cultures
uh different towns uh and seeing how
basically how the rest of the uh the country uh uh lives
uh some not so good some bad uh and some good um let's see
denver colorado
i lived in denver for a couple years which is uh really a great uh
uh city
uh
and then i lived in uh atlanta which is uh uh really a great state where is you know you have the southern attitude <a> a southern attitude southern attitude
which is everybody's friendly and gets along and
and
let's see
i've been back and forth across this country at least
sixteen to twenty times so
yeah it's it's been it's been it's been an adventure
<laughter>
uh arkansas
little rock
where i had to get into a uh
you might wanna say a a altercation
with the rednecks down there because as as you know um
i'm african american
and down there they're very prejudiced you know they're the uh
uh southern uh uh
uh
which what were the rebels uh not rebels but uh
what were they uh confederates they still have this uh uh tendency of thinking blacks
or any other culture besides whites aren't uh
valuable people
yeah so it i had a incident down there where it actually turned into a shoot out
but i'm okay
a little of both it it depends on it depends on the time
on the period it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know
i can be outgoing 'cause i do uh like to go to  nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and
i know like i said i uh i did some entertainment before so
at clubs i'm more outgoing
in social events more shy
<laughter>
meditate
very good
very good because
uh if i let my temper get the best of me i uh tend to um
cause more
harm
than good
you know uh harm to the person harm to myself by
you know uh
physical altercations or um going to jail
and so yeah i'm very good at uh
controlling my emotions
my temper
good question
uh
okay girlfriend <laughter> uh
we just recently broke up about two three weeks ago
because of a argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do
and she wanted to do it anyway so
uh that led to a argument and the argument ended in us breaking up so yeah
it was emotional uh
but
um i'm fifty five and it's not my first break up so
i just take it in stride and and move on
uh
well it's it's probably it's
no one no no situation actually can be
i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time there's probably always a better way to handle it
after the fact
but uh
i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my  wife broke up
i think i could've handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered
and more irrational so i could've handled that one better yes
what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation
well like i said uh being young and and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and
uh
not being able to communicate
with another person on the level of
of
understanding
<laughter>
hmm
leaving home
well it was like
<sigh>
what can i say
it was about
one o'clock two o'clock in the morning
and i just decided to pack up and and and leave  uh without letting anyone know that i was leaving
that was like one of the hardest decisions i've had to make
sketchy
loving but sketchy uh
my family's in detroit and atlanta georgia
i'm in california l_a
i have no one out here so
uh i'm basically on my own and i've been on my own for a long time so
uh we communiate
and we talk and send
christmas cards thanksgiving cards you know and in that factor but uh as far as uh
family it's
it's
it's sketchy
no one
hm
uh
i don't know
uh most things that that i don't wanna remember i don't so and i have erased
a lot of things from my memory or
uh placed them in a closet which i can't open anymore to to remember that so
but the most thing that i can say is uh uh
i won't go into detail on it but a incident where
it caused great bodily harm to a person
in the last two weeks uh with the i've had uh
this hearburn problem so in the last two weeks it's been really difficult
for me to get uh
some sleep 'cause i have a i have uh in my pocket right now i have a a jar of tums
it's keeping me pretty uh sedated right now
irritable
um
anxious
um
need to get things done
uh
and
i feel like uh i have uh people
and things that's
against me and trying to block everything that i'm doing to succeed and that's been a great uh disturbance to me
yes it is but you know like i said i take everything it with a grain of salt
and i keep pushing because
uh you can't stay mad
or vengeful at any one person or any one thing too long because it doesn't accomplish anything so i have to keep pushing
uh no basically i'm still <s> still the same i just
just keep my thoughts <th> uh i keep my ideas that i need to do
uh and try to accomplish uh uh what i need to uh uh accomplish
post mm traumatic stress
uh no uh uh
yes
uh
back in uh
oh nine
two thousand nine
um
crying
a lot
uh
not trusting
uh suspiciousness of other people
uh so what
uh
and i was uh recommended
uh and referred to a medical uh
uh um
mental health uh facility
for treatment
off and on yes when i feel depressed and feel anxiety building up in me uh yes i still have treatment
yes because i get a chance to express uh some of the things that
i normally don't express
and i can i can like
blow off steam or uh
blow off
the anxiety part of uh my depression
hmm
well i don't know uh really really happy um
oh
when uh
well i was really really happy when
my uh the girl that i just broke up with
came from upstate
for us to be together
that's when i was really really happy
and then that turned around within two weeks but at that point in time
when that happened i was really really happy
witty

<laughter> witty
um informative <inf>
informative
um
um social
uh
i
basically everybody say i need i should've became a counselor because i'm very
enlightened in a lot of life's uh problems so uh
my friends would describe me as helpful
probably
education more education

out here and she moved and remarried and
she has the she has the boys with her and
they took on the new husband's name
