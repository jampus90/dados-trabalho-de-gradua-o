value
<synch>
sure
<laughter>
mm
good i guess
new orleans louisiana
uh two thousand five
i used to go back often but not much anymore
uh just things happened
uh <laughter>
uh well
guess you're not programmed with this knowledge but uh katrina happened in two thousand five
not really
um
hmm where to begin
uh just l_a's different culturally
i have a different culture out here
it's just a different place
um it's it's bike friendly
louisiana isn't
new orleans for that matter really isn't
now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful
<sigh> the drivers they're crazy
mm not really kind of but not much anymore
don't have the money kinda broke <laughter>
just being able to go on an adventure
um
let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike
um and that that was pretty fun
kinda scary and dangerous
nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>
traveling or just in general
hmm
um
i gotta say
i gotta say we were
we were heading out of um
we were
heading off the p_c_h and going into um
laguna
and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic
and i i remember going down
the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click
and i was like oh god
and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic
going down a hill
unable to brake
and i'm going down
and suddenly
there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i
turn
sharply
in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic
and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes
and like not managing to keep my bike from
rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot
so yeah
yeah that's it
<laughter>
um
various different things uh anthropology visual effects
kinda weird but yeah
um
i just i've always had a fascination with film
and
i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating
just as like the the mob mentality of people
especially
ooh dream job
um
huh
i have no idea
just a job i guess
i consider myself more outgoing
um
you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me
like people xxx i i i like people i don't know
i'm not
i'm not afraid of what they think
eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me
i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really
affect me
eh
um
<deep breath> <mumbling> <sigh> uh i play video games listen to music
um
yeah read books i like reading books and drawing
reading books drawing playing video games
did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping
i like sleeping it's fun
uh <mumbling> not good
<laughter> frequently <laughter>
um
<sigh>
uh
in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker
um
yeah
yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker
that's a great way to get suspended
um
i don't know
yeah things like that just
getting into fights
<sigh>
um
like a serious argument
um <sigh>
uh
i guess like
xxx
argument over
over
um
uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control
and gun control laws
i mean
it was like
yesterday evening
eh it was
it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally
but that was like the last argument i got into
that that's kinda what you specified i think
ooh
um
uh my entire life um
<laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh>
i have
um
about
two years ago i broke up
with like as everyone calls her my evil ex
and um
yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean
uh
eh
<sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then
like just as a person as a whole
but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like
a hundreds plus miles in a singular day
and i was in a ton of pain
like
later in the evening i got home i was like oh god
like i could barely walk um
and yeah i i think running off and
like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like
eating too much and like
just
overeating 'cause i was depressed
but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death
<deep breath> <sigh> hmm
um
i don't think i've had a singular hard decision
i've had ever had to make
because
my my biggest thing
in life
is don't you know don't regret
don't regret
the the the things you do
just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me
that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years
like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept
and to answer your question
i think thinking about it
the hardest decision i've had to make
is
i'd say
probably
probably to break up with my ex probably
um
xxx <sigh> ooh
um <sigh> where do i begin
<sigh>
um
my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word
um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with
um just to the the people around her and to me
and
i
<deep breath>
<laughter> you know
they say you're supposed to give forgive people
for making mistakes or doing things
and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for
no matter how hard you try
and i think there are some things that once done
that that can't be
undone they just they're they're the way that they are
and i think
i think after what she did
i i like i just xxx
eh
things just fell apart after that it just it it we
mm despite us trying
it just it didn't work out
i mean
i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened
oh geez
oh man
erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening
um
huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard
um
katrina
just the experience of katrina for starters
um <laughter> my <m> my ex
i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina
'cause that was just that that was not
i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um
in two thousand five um
uh this giant storm hit
uh
new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people
leveled the town
um
and um
i i lost a lot of friends during the storm
um
i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it
but
it's still
it's it's still there
and i think
uh i i don't know i mean
you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive
in that but there's just there's nothing the only
thing you can do
is <i> is
just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again
though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know
<laughter> earthquakes
<laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather
rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming
yes
<laughter> yeah
<sigh> um
mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times
that's no surprise
um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school
um which would've been
<sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago
i don't know xxx
i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's
it's when i first was told that i was depressed
um
as far as p_t_s_d goes
um post katrina
um
and then
you know
uh just
post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing
um
i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school
it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school
and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it
um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it
um
you know
just kinda happened
no not not anymore
um
eh
<sigh>
<laughter> that's a good question um <laughter>
uh geez uh you know i really don't know
i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore
uh sometimes
sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today
and stuff and
you know
it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but
ask me in two hours and who knows
you know
um
<sigh>
i guess
it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen
and to just get on and move along with your life
um
mm essentially just
mm like carry on you know
things will happen carry on
<sigh>
um
wow <laughter> um
uh i was um
i was hanging out with my girlfriend just
hanging out
um
well for starters i mean
you <y> you can't
see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently
and uh i'd i'd make my leg better
um
let's see cane's over there
that way but anyway um <sigh>
i don't know
uh make myself less fat
<laughter>
um
i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day
um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time
like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that
i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good
like you can sleep six
you know
like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with
seven
or eight
you know
like
that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours
it's just
i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too
i mean
yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much
um
<sigh>
um
utterly insane in a good way
utterly insane in a good way
um
uh i guess
like they they would also
say like you know
there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just
you know
i i just have issues like everybody else
um specifically i have
uh asperger's so that's a form of autism
um that just kinda makes life awesome
they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric
'cause i totally am
i just
i i don't know
i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive
and you know
who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for
so i should you know
live while i'm alive and just
go out and do stuff and not
not sit and be calm
except when i'm reading
and i like reading
<sigh>
um
uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up
um
i think
i would've told myself at the time
um
'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known
my my evil ex
um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five
i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl
don't trust her she can't be trusted
um and more importantly
don't
<deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that
and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally
um
yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain
it's not worth it
<sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive
maybe
yeah
uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it
um
just
i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride
i don't really feel pride
i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>
i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane
who knows
do i press the button now
oh bye
okay
