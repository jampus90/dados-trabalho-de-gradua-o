value
<synch>
yeah
i am
um good to moderate
los angeles
yeah i'm from
um
just a lot of different kinds of people and um eh i love the weather most of the time and um great creative scene i'm i'm really into music so
um it's a great scene for that
i i don't like driving <laughter> i don't know who does right
i it's just it's just such a drag and uh
getting from point a to point b is just a daily need and it doesn't get any easier
it's too many people
too many people <laughter>
<laughter>
i can't see your shoes
um
uh yeah when i can
uh when <whe> when i can afford to
um <sigh> just being somewhere else not having to drive usually most places have better public transportation
um just i love <lo> i'm you know i'm a culture junkie i like experiencing different types of cultures so
that's
xxx
um well you know i haven't been to that many places i've been to like mexico and italy
it it's uh
you know i wanna go to more places i wanna go to japan
so that'll be that'll be interesting it's usually just with my family
um it's my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just uh
yeah we go to italy we spent two weeks there though that was cool
yeah
um
living next to the best gelato shop in italy
in we <w> we were in florence <f> when we were in florence spent uh spent a week in florence
that was great
very very good uh culture there as well
art
studied uh film and digital media
'cause uh i make music and i wanted to learn how to make music videos
so it's something i'm trying to get into
uh yeah yeah i mean
i need to get a camera though that's the thing
uh but um i mainly my main focus is music i studied film but my focus is music
um yeah <y> sure
i've been playing music i've been playing guitar uh keyboard bass drums
for um for about twelve years now and uh i do uh production and songwriting i'm in a indie rock band
scrubbed_entry
um that's a great website i highly recommend it and it's uh it's mine so
check it out
uh international rockstar music producer
and uh
filmmaker
director
probably outgoing
um just just feel like it's a way to get the best <be> most out of life
uh just talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's uh
kinda just goes with the territory <caritor> territory <laughter>
<laughter> yeah
um i uh do meditation
and
uh it's not really hard 'cause it's fun
and it it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time
which uh you know that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time 'cause normally when i'm relaxing i'm i'm tuning out
i'm focusing on something else but
um to be able to combine those sensations was uh yeah i've been doing that for about
uh three months now so
yeah it is
um
almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there's things that should be said
that i that i don't
um just because
um you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily 'cause he didn't do anything to them
and uh i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a
awkward social situation but um
you know i make do
um
<makes sound with mouth>
probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh
we had a falling out we're not gonna be in a band together i mean we're still friends so
at least there's that mm but um it was just basically about
creative control of the project and how we're gonna prioritize it in in our lives and uh
you know we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so
that was the end of that
um <sigh>
i felt
good that it was definitive that it was you know a choice had been made on both parties
uh also regretful that you know he didn't
feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so
the fact that he wasn't really in it kinda pissed me off
um but
i got over it
um and you know i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me you know even honored
so
you know
i'm uh i'ma keep going
thank you
um <sigh>
hmm
i don't know
i don't really i don't really have any regrets like that
at the moment i can't really think of any
um
<deep breath>
um
when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i didn't think it would mean anything at the time
but i did it
i i regret it
but um
you know
xxx you know life happens you make some mistakes
selfishness
um being young and thinking it wouldn't matter
um
you know
thinking
you know you only live once and
you know for eh it was probably for the best ultimately 'cause you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so
that was <wa> that was years ago but
uh she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so
i regret it
<deep breath>
um
shit geez um
i guess uh whether to go to college or not 'cause uh i uh i had some projects going in l_a that i didn't really wanna
shut off uh i i had a band going we had a manager
um we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over
and um
i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and
it it was a difficult decision but
i'm glad i did 'cause i met a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that
you know we work on stuff together and all that so
it's good
i agree it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter>
um
maybe i wish i could forget
getting spanked in the parking lot when i was four by a danish babysitter
uh
you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget it so
i have a pretty vivid picture of it and
i'm i'm i'd be happier if it wasn't there
it's positive
they're supportive um they give me a hard time sometimes because
they
don't think that
i keep things in perspective in terms of how i'm gonna support myself even though i do it's just um
you know i have a
a more long range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and
the creative projects that i make so
yeah
there's a bit of tension there
just 'cause
you know they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but
i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer
but they're sweet people
how do i cope with them
uh i you know they're lovely people at their core you know
um
cope with them 'cause i love them
i just uh
you know at times i'll just uh
go off on my own for a while
and eh you know take a breather whatever
you know xxx everyone makes you mad sometimes so
<deep breath>
challenging
um <sigh> i just i try and it doesn't work
um sometimes i have to take medication for it i have to take ambien
something like that
um
yeah it's difficult <di>
i'm someone who sleeps in late
so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something
um
i get nauseous sometimes i'll throw up in the morning
um
yeah i've had jobs where i'd wake up and
you know vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible
it does suck um it's kinda
something i'm worried about you know i i kinda need to get some part time work while i'm
not
you know
getting a steady pay flow for my music production so
yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh>
got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how
just
not feeling good getting nervous when
you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or
just something i that doesn't sit
well with me like
being in a
you know a a rushed and
you know stressful work environment it just um
unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to
to give a shit frankly
like
and you know i i try to psych myself into giving a shit and
it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and you know xxx my body doesn't want that in the morning it just
i feel like my body rejects things and
yeah
okay
i've been feeling okay
very uh very reflective very contemplative
you know there's gonna be some changes and there's gonna be
some new people in my life some new people uh in my band
um
you know i'm gonna try to push myself
but try to stay grounded at the same time 'cause you know i expect more from myself
it's just pissing me off when my get my you know i basically feel like i'm
shitting all over myself my body's shitting on me anyway just by
being so um
shitty <laughter> yeah
no
yes
um i was diagnosed um
about uh
twelve years ago i haven't been in therapy since
um
they gave me zoloft and i didn't like it
it made me feel worse than i do in the shittiest moments i was telling you about it it uh it made me feel numb
um i don't wanna feel numb
i wanna feel everything even if it sucks
being forced to
it was a private school
they thought i was acting up thought i was a uppity kid i think i was just being a kid so
yes
i do
um well i haven't been in
in twelve years
but i do think that it might be helpful for me in the future
i thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there <laughter>
um well yeah i uh
uh i i kinda wanna go back to therapy it might help
might help me
find some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist i need maybe it's a life coach i have no idea but
i'll be seeking help soon
um
yesterday
i was watching a movie with my girlfriend
and i looked over at her we smiled at each other and it was it was it was great
yeah
um
very honest
um
sometimes brutally so but i'm a good guy
i think that my friends all think i'm a good guy
probably funny
um
open-minded
um
i guess well it's what i'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline
and try to work through
my body rejecting shittiness
of the world
<laughter>
it gets better <sigh>
um
stay in shape it gets harder
the longer you wait
um
don't give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing
my music
you're welcome nice talking to you
