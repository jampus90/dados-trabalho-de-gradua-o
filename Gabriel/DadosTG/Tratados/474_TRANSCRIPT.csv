value
<synch>
yes
i'm good how are you
uh i was born in hawaii but i grew up in colorado
yeah
yeah
about seven <s> uh seven to eight years ago
um i try to go back once a year <ye> once or twice a year
yeah
um it's
how does it compare to l_a um it's
it's different it's not as busy
there's more uh things to do out outdoors in the mountains
uh my family <fam>
for work
yeah i am i love it here
um it took about a year before i really felt comfortable but
um
once that got through that kinda hard year it was pretty good out here i've had a good time
um i
love that i can go to the beach
uh i love that it's warm most of the time
uh i love that i've met a lot of people that love the arts as much as i do
the traffic just like everyone else
um
yeah
yeah the traffic and
it's pretty much just traffic
earthquakes
not as much as i'd like
um it's just nice to go some place new
experience something different
um xxx i went to alaska a couple years ago and that was really awesome
i got to go fishing in the ocean and i got seasick that wasn't awesome but uh
it was cool i saw a bear in real life a bear walked through a yard
um it was really different than l_a it was really cool
<laughter>
english creative writing
well i always wanted to tell stories so
it just made sense to work on writing in somehow some aspect
yeah i am
to
have my own t_v show where i write it and everyone watches it every week and it's awesome
really hard
'cause there's a lot of people that have the same dream so
yeah
more outgoing than shy
uh i like talking to people i enjoy other people
mm um go to the movies or
turn on music dance
pretty good
um <sigh> it was at work couple about a month ago <ag> about a month ago
um i got
mad at someone because i didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions
and so um when i tried to have a conversation about it they got mad and then i got mad and
we got mad
um i felt like i wasn't being heard or listened to and
i felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so
um because we couldn't have a dialogue i felt like no one was listening to me
totally
um
<makes sound with mouth>
i uh
i i um
no regrets no <laughter> um <laughter>
i guess
hmm
i don't know if there is one i mean i'm sure there is but
uh one time i was driving behind someone and they well they cut me off
and
i think it'd just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago
um it was just one of those days where i just didn't want
or i just it had been a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got in an accident with them i just followed them to their parking spot
and
actually i had honked at them and they they flipped me off
and so it just really really got under my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh
and then flip me off
so i i followed them to the spot and i asked i said miss why did you flip me off when you cut me off
and and she said oh you know i'm
i've had a rough day i don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter and you know
i didn't need to be petty like that but i just
i wanted to be i guess
ooh <sigh> mm look at you going deep
<laughter> um
oh i guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom uh
telling her i was gay
i mean it wasn't hard 'cause it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she
she had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but once she did you know everything was better and i knew it would be
but it was just hard in the moment to
you know tell her something she didn't wanna hear
okay
um
when i was a little kid my um
my grandfather found our dog run over on the on the road
and he uh
scrubbed_entry
and brought it in and i think i remember as a kid just
uh like seeing death like that really just
threw me off and
uh frightened me and
uh it was just one of those moments that i i guess i wish i hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad
and uh
it was just one of those moments i guess you need as a kid but i didn't really wanna experience like loss like that in your face
yeah
my relationship with my family is pretty good um
we're probably not as close as most but uh we
you know we always
we don't talk often but we talk with love and we
always love each other when we see each other
um
my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me
to uh you know pursue my dreams and
not to let the little things get me down so i'm glad i had her
usually it's easy um sometimes it's not
um
well i've been between jobs recently i start a new job uh next week
but
while i've been off uh while i haven't been working um i tend to like
my body wants to stay up later and later and later and i'm trying not to like
fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven
so i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty
and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half
when i should be
i should <sh> i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine but
still wanna stay up i guess
uh a little scatterbrained like today i'm a little scatterbrained 'cause uh
i i tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and
so <sigh> scatterbrained <laughter>
um well since i've had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because
um you don't know what to do with it when you're not working i guess um
but
yeah
i think that answers the question
um i just that maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with uh the not working thing
no
mm mm
um a couple days ago when i got my new job <laughter> when i got hired
um
outgoing listening
uh attentive
um
fun
loyal
i think
i hope
um i wish that i
uh i probably wish that i looked better i wish i had more hair up here mm losing it a little bit
uh probably wish i was a little skinnier this
this girdle's pretty tight <laughter> and um
you know sometimes i wish i had more money but
nothing too drastic
i'm okay
yeah
oh um
mm hmm when i was a little kid
i was uh i was the fat <f> i was the fat kid
and um
gosh i remember i was like i was going into high school
and it was like the second day
and i remember this guy came up to me and was
um
like he was like pretty nice to me i thought
and i didn't realize he'd
like this is like out of a movie right like he had put bandaids on my back that said like i'm a fat cow
and said like uh like
yeah
like just a bunch of mean stuff and i didn't know and i walked around with it for like half an hour i heard people laughing and i didn't get it and then finally this girl just came up to me and was like hey
there's like bandaids on your back that say all these mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take 'em off
and i remember like i couldn't get 'em i was trying to find 'em and then
um
i just remember like putting my head in my locker and like
i didn't want anyone to see me cry so i just like put my head in my locker
and like pretended like i was looking at stuff in my backpack but really i was you know
the crying fat kid who couldn't get the mean stickers off his back
mm yeah
anything
um
probably
yeah
<sharp inhale>
um
you know
i would xxx i would try to keep
i would try to let myself know to to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you
i think i spent too much time as like a adolescent
worrying what people thought of me
and as i got older i didn't care as much and i started enjoying life a lot more so
uh i went to coachella it's a music festival it was three days with
all of my friends and my boyfriend and we
uh we danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time
yeah
oh <sigh> um i guess my
my career humble as it may be
uh i really stuck in l_a um a long time
when it was uh
when like it was hard i stayed <stay> i stuck around i didn't quit so
you know i'm proud that i've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and
try to make it in hollywood
my pleasure
bye
bye
bye
