value
<synch>
yes
i'm doing good
i was born in lynwood
i like all the sightseeing and all the
clothing and stores that they have
well some things all the graffiti um
basically all the wrongdoing
criminal activity and all that bad stuff
i've traveled in the past um
i don't really go out of state
basically
budget money money budget expenses doesn't
limit me to go to another state
i studied automotive technology
and welding
just a passion for cars since i was little
uh
always basically
just wanted to work on cars
pretty
yeah i really love working on cars
my dream job would probably be
probably to own my own
automotive shop or
to own a barber shop
or to just basically be a
probably a master welder
consider myself a little more outgoing
just because i like having fun being uh
just having fun with my friends
being able to do anything i please
basically just smoke on my free time sometimes or
just lay down watch a movie listen to some music
basically hip hop music
or maybe
a good comedy movie
uh fairly easy about it
i don't really
let go get let my bad side get to my emotions
probably earlier today about with my girlfriend
or wife basically about where we gonna go eat
felt desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to go eat
since she wouldn't make up her mind kinda made me
uneasy
probably just to relax and stay calm more than just to outburst and raise my voice
wrongdoings in my past basically anything i could've changed
mm to better myself
basically uh
doing something better at a job that or maybe
uh not doing the job at my greatest
hardest decision would have to be
uh
to plan a family probably
uh just basically
making sure all the situations are where they're supposed to be and
talking it out with my partner
if we're really ready to begin a family
<clears throat>
just basically
the love and bond between me and my wife
um
basically might be like a crash accident
uh basically
pretty horrific
scary experience
when uh i almost crashed into
the freeway barrier
and the car spun out and it basically almost ended up off of a little hill
it was a pretty scary experience as far as
just uh being in a car by myself not being able to control the vehicle
at all and just hoping that i was gonna be okay
it's fairly easy except <exc> if as long as i've had a good dinner
early on in my day fairly would go to sleep pretty good
just restless and just a little more stressed constant things more
would be on my mind
lack of energy maybe
xxx pretty relaxed calm
not really just same old
me day through day just
try to stay happy and relaxed calm just try to stay positive energy
no i have not being diagnosed
no i have not been diagnosed by depression
um earlier today when i had some food
um it's pretty close bonded
it was good
we talk about a lot of necessary stuff try to help each other out at all times
uh my father my sister
my mother
well my father's been there for as long as my mother
has been and she they've both helped me as much as possible from school to
clothing to hmm uh takes me to my sister she's basically
graduated from college so she's like a
a mentor to me kind of look up to her as far as
graduating school and everything try to keep going
mm they're pretty fun
they're outbursting minds basically just smarter
kinda seem
more advanced thinking
compared to what the kids were probably thinking back in the the old age
they learn things a little more quicker
uh no not majorly
just things that i could've thought i could've done
better or
or just a little differently
uh like building my car differently
um
getting
traffic violations
basically just uh
kinda wish i wouldn'ta
sped through intersections or
gotten all those tickets i've received on my record
yeah
i would've basically
just after you realize it the first time try not to do it again
so the same mistake doesn't happen
uh
just my persona kind of as far as uh
whenever i'm angry
just to
find a way to be more easygoing
maybe try to
not be so much of a negative thinker at times when when things get a little harder
<clears throat>
uh
basically when somebody
accuses you of
wrongdoing that probably has hasn't been done
um
basically when a police officer tells you you've done wrong when you clearly know that you have not done
anything wrong
probably earlier this year
basically
a police officer pulled me over for thinking that i was a drunk driver
made me feel really really dumb about myself or tried to accuse me of wrongdoing that i've been drinking and smoking when that was not the cause
i was just very tired that night it was twelve a_m
therefore
i was trying i was i looked probably a little sleepy
just uh
fun cool
easygoing good attitude
um loyal <l> xxx loyal
um
drifting drifting my two forty s_x um spending quality time with my my wife and kids
um
basically
everything i've done for myself from when i graduated high school up to now
thank you
bye
