was shouting at me i could hear it 'cause our windows were open it was a hot summer day
and then
later
i drove up beside her and i said in a pleasant way i said i was just trying to signal
to get into your lane
'cause she was
cursing at me through the window prior to that
and she lifted up her finger <f> just lifted up her finger <laughter> and gave me the finger and it was just
it's funny sometimes you try to approach someone
in just a normal
loving way and all they have for you is hate and that did make me feel bad <laughter>
<laughter>
a little angry
