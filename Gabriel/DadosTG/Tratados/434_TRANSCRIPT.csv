value
<synch>
yes i am
i'm doing very good today
i'm originally from chicago illinois
moved out here when i was three
yes
i never go back
family issues
it depends on what you're into
if you're into
um the fast life and hollywood it doesn't compare at all
um if you're into the cold weather then you would rather be out there i i like the sun
i'll
my mom and my dad split up
<laughter> it's okay
i have no idea i was only three when i moved out here
i like the sunshine
i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter
fall and and and the summer i like the beaches i like hollywood
i like that the lakers are here and
and
<laughter> i love um the people is it's a different variety i think
l_a is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to l_a for a better opportunity so that's what i like about l_a
oh gang violence
<laughter>
no not really i've traveled one time to arizona and one time to stockton california
and another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now mainly because of finances
i studied alcohol and drug counseling
i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that that's what i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions so
um
that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and
i just went into it
to do it just just to see what it was
and
i finished school and
did a intership and got hired and so
i believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life
i'm not working right now i actually moved away and
i had to <deep breath>
i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um
in order to make that move
but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling
well
it can be it can be very difficult at times because
um
i have a felony uh and and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly
and but the regular dopes i can
and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours
so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um
yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience
and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard
<laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility
um
or or as an author
you know that depends <de>
that depends on on
on people mainly i mainly
adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky then i'm gonna be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not shy i'm just giving 'em their space and allowing them to decide when they wanna open up
but if people open up right away then i open up right away
<laughter>
i i mainly listen to music or
i watch youtube
write poetry
um
or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i can't
so <laughter> that's
and another thing i do is
i eat ice cream <laughter>
controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that
last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was
um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred
i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and
i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and
you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it
i just believe that
and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um
heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that
well i was just telling you about um
it was it was my mother's husband and
to tell you the truth um
i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped
you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure
as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um
that
i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so
i should've just left
i should've just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um
yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months
so
yeah those six nine months i can't get back
yes
well my brother's in prison um i haven't seem him in twenty years he's been there twenty years my sister moved to chicago
thirteen years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother
and um
my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and
how that's gonna turn out for me i've just you know i have small family and
i have family in chicago but
i don't
mess around with that side of the family just just because um
of what i seen
and heard so i just don't want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance
someone who's been a positive influence <inf>
influence in my life i would say
scrubbed_entry
taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me <m>  me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else
and
taught taught me how
how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until
that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um
and of course um he's
he was the one that encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he got
twenty seven years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and he <h> the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that i'll never forget
feel guilty about
my grandfather
um passed away in two thousand four
and
at that time i was just getting out of prison
um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he
told me in so many words that he wasn't gonna be around for that much longer
but i didn't get it 'cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that
plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying
but
when he died
i figured out that he was telling me
that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then
and
i feel
i think about it all the time
something i can erase from my memory
huh
would be the day
my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like
that's one memory i just i can just go without
replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there
i felt conflicting feelings
because on one hand
on one hand my brother was protecting me
from getting beat
and on the other hand he was hitting my mom
so
was kinda in the middle
uh most nights i don't
i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably <prob> i'm more than likely up at seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep
it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well
i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um
if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep
how i been feeling lately
i just been feeling like
that
things are about to start going better for me
um making some better decisions
um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people
that can um open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes
i don't care if i get
five interviews i'm i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission
and
and um i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people
um know about me because i've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before
um
the that the public is exposed to what um i've been gathering
my behavior i'm more mellow
um i laugh more more humorous
i let a lot of things go that i used to just
let tick me off
and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and
mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally
and psychologically eh
and the um
acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me
so
i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um
my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm
you know um
back then i just tolerated myself now i um
actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you
to feel the same way
no no i haven't
no
last time i felt happy was last night 'cause the lakers won the basketball game
<laughter>
yeah
my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth
because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it
and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it
and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people
um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them
like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and
yes that's why he calls me the truth <laughter>
um
i wish i would've never
well obviously i wish i would've never went to prison um
i wish
that i could change
well
um my economic status my employment status
and um
my teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of
stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be
um
confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up
every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they looking at my teeth i wonder if they're looking at my teeth i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says
are they looking at my teeth so i would really
change that and i would change my physical um size i think i would like to be
at least thirty five pounds heavier but i'm working on it
twenty years ago which would make me eighteen
i would've at that time i was a big time um high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i would've given myself the opportunity
was to stay away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i
could've been playing for the lakers last night but
hey
i'm most proud of the fact that
you know what i'm most proud of my mom
really
really
um
she graduated from school
she had a full-time job she had a full-time job um she would wake up at
five in the morning
go to work
get off her job at three thirty go straight to the college leave the college at nine o'clock at night she does this five days a week
and still had the strength to maintain um she was on the dean's list and the president's list so doing all of this
you know when they say xxx
that older people can't do things i i just think that dispels that rumor um
and she recently got her um license as a evangelist in the church so
i'm just real proud of that and um
her life has been affecting people
in a in a positive way so yeah my mom
<laughter> okay thank you
goodbye
