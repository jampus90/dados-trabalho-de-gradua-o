meeting new people seeing new things
exploring the landscape
uh i went to alaska
on a fishing trip

um catching an octopus
i was deep sea fishing and for halibut
and rather than catching a halibut
i lured in a octopus
very <laughter>
<laughter>
i play golf i swim

and it was about
a musical project that i was involved in
i felt heated
<laughter>
i'm not quite sure
i'm not quite sure
i'd have to think about that for a while
i'm not really sure
um
i had a bad performance one time

<deep breath>
what was that question
to read more and watch t_v
watch the computer screen less

have attention deficit disorder
and you focus less on things that are in front of you in real life
