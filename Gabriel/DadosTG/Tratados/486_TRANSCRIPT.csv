uh to take care of a good friend that who who's ill
thank you
i jumped right back on the bandwagon
the climate
and the restaurants
the dirt
and the traffic
yes i do
uh the road maps following a road map
maybe driving myself
well we just recently got back from uh colorado
went up into the mountains saw the the snow and
enjoyed a little fine dining
in colorado
uh actually going um
horseback riding through the royal gorge

<laughter>
i listen to jazz music and i also draw
i've probably mastered controlling my temper
through age
mm it would've been my husband and it was about financial
issues
unsure <un> unsure
unstable i don't like loud talking or mm loud emotion
i like to sit and methodically and logically talk about things
not raise my voice
hmm
most recently with the illness of my friend i wish i would've handled his sister a little differently as far as
things that she's wanted me to do
that i really needed to tell her
otherwise
the way they really needed to be done
i took her advice where i shouldn't of
um we he i was engaged to him
fifteen years ago and he recently called me i guess about five years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer
we've always maintained our friendship
and i asked my husband if i could go help him in his time of need and
i'm here
it has been
um a lot of things one he's a good friend of mine and his sister moved out here as well
two my son wanted to start his career out here
three i love the weather
and that's all i can think of at the moment <laughter>
mhm
uh it would be the the death of my youngest son
i don't know where to start as far as he was born premature
and since he was born so early i had him in five months versus nine
the we
we made the decision to take him off life support 'cause he wasn't getting any better
so that would've been the the hardest decision i made
with my husband
mhm
um
i really don't wanna erase anything from my memory
i've actually um
learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so i'm not <ss>
i'm not one to put things erase things out of my mind
i categorize them
and place them in memories
uh it's very close
lost my mother at a young age
and uh all of us siblings and my father still remain very close
mm my father
oh he's very health conscious very energetic and exercises <e> uh exercises
and
has a spirituality about him

i want
to have as well it's a contentment
that he that he portrays that i that i would like to have as well
