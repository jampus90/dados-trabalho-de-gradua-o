i am
mm making
a good living through my art
it's challenging
well
i need <nee> it's about having the time
and finding
a niche that appeals to
others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision
somewhere in between
i read
i walk dogs
i spend time with my family
oh it's very good i i love my family very much and they love me very much we're very supportive of each other
i'm pretty good most of the time i'm not so great
when i'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic
but it's not out of control <laughter>
hmm
i don't really remember i wanna say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid <laughter> some little
stupid thing
um
my daughter is um
thirty nine
beautiful
brilliant
um
very talented very uh
uh
goal driven
my son is twenty seven
he is more laid back
sweet <s> very sweet
um and he's
starting to
be a little more goal driven
um a little less satisfied with just uh the daily grind
being a parent is um
very challenging
in a wonderful way
um i think the hardest thing is is
eh fear and worry for your children um
today's world can be very
um
violent and scary and you fear for your children's safety and well-being
i'm sorry
oh gosh
um
mm friendship <frien> eh the close friendship you have with your children the
the uh uh love the support the joy of just
everyday little things that you share
oh <laughter> well i'm i i
talk to my children about anything and everything
um we're very <v> have a very open communication
which in my parents' generation i think children were more seen and not heard
<deep breath> hmm <sigh>
well with my daughter my first child i was young
and inexperienced not only in being a mother but
and naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general
and i think probably eh most parents mm have regrets uh
of uh situations they may have had their children in when they were
when they were young that
weren't the best
<deep breath> <sigh>
sometimes i feel that i should've
been
more aware
at a younger age
mm just xxx just mm decisions and situations that uh decisions you make situations you find yourself in when you're younger
out of being naive and and um
even though logically i know that
it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time
you know as you get older you eh hindsight is twenty twenty as you get older you you look back and wish that you
had've been more on top of your your uh
your life when you were younger
oh gosh
i honestly can't think of anything
hmm
um
i don't know that i would want i i can think of an event i don't know that i would wanna erase it from my memory because
eh i feel that we learn from
everything
and there <the> there's i i don't wanna lose the lesson that i'm to learn from that experience
positive influence in my life uh my daughter
my son my granddaughter
um
there's a a a oddly enough an author uh carlos castaneda
um
just a a a positive <po> my my family's been a positive influence because of their love and support and
uh in reading carlos castaneda's works i find that he
has a brilliant mind
and because i've
practiced some of what
he talks about in his books
and experience them
as being authentic
um
uh whereas some people
you know
question his validity i i found that
he has something very extraordinary to offer
mankind
pretty easy
<laughter> i fall asleep pretty quick
good
<deep breath> mm
no not really just always looking for the next uh
um
project to
to uh
get started on
no
no

and uh my children gave me flowers and beautiful gifts and made me a wonderful brunch and
we spent the day together and it was very very nice
oh um
easygoing
um
easy to be around um

<deep breath> hmm
i would like to work on
being um
more focused
on
on uh projects
oh gosh
probably when i was a kid you know kids can be uh
kids can be cruel to each other
uh
so nothing that um
i still
at this age
take personally or or you know hold a grudge for
um
sure everybody has regrets but
you do the best you can do at the time and you learn and you move on
mm
i don't <do> i don't know i
i can't answer that one
