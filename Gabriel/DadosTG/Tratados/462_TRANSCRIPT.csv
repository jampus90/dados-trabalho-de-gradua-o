value
<sync>
yeah
i'm okay
uh i'm from los angeles
mhm
oh um the weather <laughter> the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid backness the
driving instead of public transportation
and the sporty
um
i really
i don't know the lack of um
uh uh mm
i don't know there's not a lot i don't like about l_a as compared to most cities i really
it's my favorite and i've lived around the world i love it i love l_a
a lot
<laughter>
yes i've lived
in paris and i've been around the world a lot
um uh it's just um it's
fun and it's it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to
get to um
get to experience all the
fantastic um sights and and
<ss> and cultures
um uh well i mean um uh
i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i
i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for
spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um
and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um
there's a grind there you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then
i mean i still um
i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really
a sucker for that kind of stuff
um
i guess madagascar
was pretty much like just
really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and
it was like you were seeing a lot of
uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might've been lying
um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah
um i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education
degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to
just to get the um
just to get the stipend i didn't really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do
i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um
the way the school system goes right now it um it just it
it turns people into
into um just um
just uh dog eat dog um you know i i don't like the way
the people <peo> it i think it's so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that
that would be my dream job that so i'm excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work
with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal
um you know uh trajectory
um
i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via
any sort of um
legislation
except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know
facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways
i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so
i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system
uh i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think
um
i don't know actually i'm kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa so you don't know
<laughter> yeah
yeah
yeah that's cool
um
i definitely um
uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so
a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot
so that's
quite soothing i try not to do i don't really do anything that's too
tense unless it's time for it like time to drive to a job or time to
you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise
um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and
but you know and i
i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer's coming so i'm gonna swim some more too
um when i'm truly outraged uh it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of
bad parts right now 'cause it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child so
there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam
a little bit but usually pretty much there's always um
you know someone
in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so
usually some kind of sanity can prevail
oh well i mean these are times where i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out
you know um sabotaged or or definitely just
when uh what's the last specific time well i
you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um
the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of
i mean she's pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her
i felt like um
i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt
in a way
good because
i get it
you know which is as opposed to not getting it
which is
even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank
of
the thing to get to to where
you can be a little more constructive about it it's like
you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty
but so i mean i don't <do> i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel
there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because
there are people that will try to use that against you that's all
but i never really feel bad for
being angry about what i'm angry about
well when i was pregnant i wish i had um
like i said um i i went through um
such an awakening about realizing when i was being
sort of um undermined that um
that demanding my respect became a huge issue and
when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place 'cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where
um i was set to be when the child arrived that i
stormed out
via what was a good survival mode before but
left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid
so
yeah
it's fucked up
yeah
i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and
cohesive
i don't
and integrated i don't wanna erase anything from my memory
um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong
<laughter>
um yeah i'm uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to
sign um
sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and i should've said no let's just go straight to court because the
there is nothing wrong with me i just
happen to
succumb to an s_s_i check via bullshit with my mother and i should've just
been you know
um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out
overcautiousness
it's
horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality
intrigue and sabotage it's bad
it's okay
someone that i mean
there's been um
you know there's been some
some great people uh again from afar i have not sort of
really um
achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that right right right <r> right now and i think that's a lot why i don't have my son but
as i've grown and developed i've seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so that's wonderful and um
but otherwise you know a constant
you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to um
get to that point
not so easy these days at all
um i'm being i've been um i'm not
completely centered and then there's been some
um actual you know
uh
people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment
and stuff like that
um
i'm still pretty pollyanna'd out i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible
i'm tired and drained and a little bit um frustrated because that i know that um
i've been sort of
that i sort of have a bit of
um my um energy and and space being usurped <u> usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and past it
no
no
um
there are i'm i'm i'm basically very very very happy pretty much
blissed out person but
um this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that
it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realized i was such a happy person
are thrown there again so i'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but
you know um during the day i'll i'll i'll i'll think something completely true and organic and i i'll just stare at something and go wow that's beautiful and i'll be reminded that i'm
pretty close to my spirit so
um
i try to stay there twenty four seven i'm pretty spiritual that way
um uh
uh
fun i mean if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there um
that you know that i'm this is off you guys
that i'm funny and that um
and that um
i think that's bad um that i'm funny and that i'm good and that that i'm trustworthy
um
just uh i'm i'm i not necessarily change but grow through um my ability to connect with the people i wanna connect with
and disconnect from the people that
manage to
to
drain me
i already said i regret the thing with um
leaving the place where i could've delivered my son even though i was being
um uh sort of
abused
get the fuck away from your mother <laughter>
sorry um you know and like a lot of the <th> um
and and
yeah and to open your eyes look what look what's going on
i'm proud of my um spirit and my outlook and
my um my access to um what's really going on in the world and
my um awakeness i'm just proud of
me as a person
okay
you're welcome
bye
