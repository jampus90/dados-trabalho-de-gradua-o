value
<synch>
yes
i'm well thank you
uh boston massachusetts
yes
i moved to l_a about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one
uh quite often at least a couple times a year
um god i love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that that i love
uh to pursue acting and writing
mm it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um
the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and
it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality
<sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path
uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so
sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year round and
uh i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is
what i don't like uh well i miss my family <fam> i miss that there's not <no> i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here
mhm
mm i can't see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and
mm eh florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here
oh just to have an adventure do something fun or if i'm going home it means i'm gonna see my family
<clears throat>
um one of my trips mm god well
i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco i have family and friends there
always super super fun uh in god in college i with my college boyfriend
when i was in boston i we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to l_a and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one
uh in general
just
<clears throat> mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and
i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport
we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was
it was big monumental
i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever
mhm
studied communications um got a lots of every lot of different uh writing writing styles i eventually graduated with a a concentration in public relations and a english minor
writing to pursue writing
writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first
hard
very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to
i would say outgoing on in general
i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise
calming calming area and just
just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to
to come back to a calm neutral place
i am
getting better no <laughter> um i'm okay <ok> i'm
good at controlling my temper
'cause i don't usually
have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it
yes
no
<laughter> hmm mm
argued with someone um
god
i guess it was a friend
a friend a girlfriend it
it wasn't it was about
uh our
our each separate perspectives on a
a certain situation between us that
were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is
this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly
<sigh> hmm mm
i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that
it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it
mm
i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've
made the outcome much less
chaotic
hmm
uh i guess that would be
hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and
kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for
sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and
i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that
you know you're not always gonna
feel great <gr> every decision's not always gonna be easy and feel good
yes
i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just
yeah
mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be
in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that
my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i'm completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and
i could not ask for a better family they're
the ideal
my parents for sure they're just wonderful people that just taught by example and
i feel like i'm a good mix of both of them
it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've
come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy
<sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm
in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and
uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and
just um sweat more just feel
feel um just a little off
i've been feeling pretty good lately
mm not really just
trying to be more focused <clears throat>
get things done
um just trying to focus on what i wanna do career-wise and really
stop wasting time or you know
just procrastinating and and get things done and being inspired going and seeing
you know being around people that are doing what i wanna do and just carrying it over to my own life
no
no
uh oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and
that's why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome i'm always happy when i see her
probably as um  very
funny
humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say joking always a little
wise-ass in my personality but um they would describe me as always uh unconditional there for them and just
they know they know that i'm there if they need them always
my drive being more driven and just getting things done
mm i guess it would be well a recent
a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh
yeah sort of just
uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and
even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel
like i'm let allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so
i'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible
yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts
don't second-guess yourself
<sigh> <clears throat> um great listener
constant sense of humor
uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all
just people from just all ages race gender
whatever i just i crave diversity and love to just you know i just i i i'm people person
and i um
i start every day with a blank slate
i um i did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience very inspiring
probably coming out to l_a on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what i wanna do
thank you
goodbye
