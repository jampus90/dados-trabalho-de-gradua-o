um when i went to school i studied child development and nursing
um
i know i wanted to be somebody and when i went to school i wasn't sure what i wanted to be
so i kinda took um nursing the l_v_n program first
and then i didn't wanna be a nurse so i changed my major to child development and i graduated from that
no i'm actually looking for work i'm unemployed right now
my dream job would be
probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business
in my mind it's simple but like in reality it seem like it's kinda difficult <laughter>
sometimes i'm shy but i'm really an outgoing person and a people person
hmm
<laughter>
um to relax i listen to some slow music i kinda like um
have a quiet environment
and maybe lay down watch a little t_v or something
i'm very good at controlling my temper
i don't like to get really angry or upset
or
get to where
i'm fitting to hurt somebody <laughter>
um
when i really have arguments they're like because people don't agree to disagree
and then it's over <o> like really petty it's like
we might say oh it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that it's just stupid i don't even remember <laughter>
um
probably not working right now i need a job <laughter>

um
my relationship with my family i don't have
i just really stay with my dad and i have a daughter
and we just stay close all my family they're either in um
houston texas
or
they're around but i don't really socialize with a lot of my family
my dad
because um i live with him right now i've been staying with him maybe about five <f> five to six years

he's just the only one i really look up to i don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and
that's it <laughter>
scrubbed_entry
she's in the fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the sixth grade and i'm kinda excited for that
sometimes it's easy but uh sometimes it gets a little overwhelming
um the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent
it's just you always have somebody to bring you joy i enjoy always doing things with my daughter
um it's just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always
it's brings me so much joy being a parent
well
um my parents when i was younger
they
lived apart so my mom
i don't know i'm i'm a much better parent 'cause i'm more interested about what my child wants to do i'm involved in her life
her every step just
i'm really fully involved my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem
so it just
i had to mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids
so
it was
um
just
my parents and um
their drug addiction i wish i could erase that from my memory
um now i cope with them
well but um when i was growing up it just was rough it was very rough
had to do a lot of things on my own
um they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know i just
i didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything it just was like i was in a world by myself
yeah
oh it's very easy i sleep well every night i can sleep any time i sleep very well
um
a little sad but most of the time i'm very happy i'm just not happy with where i am in my life right now
um
not really i really i try to think very positive and try to do whatever i can every day to look for work and
just stay positive and focused
no i haven't
no i haven't
um the last time i felt very happy was when i graduated from um college i felt very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and
that was the last time i was really really very happy like that
i felt like i was on top of the world i felt like
just
overwhelmed with joy just
everything was just so exciting for me that day i was just very very happy nothing could make me upset that day i was very happy and when i think about that day it just
it's a very happy experience for me
um
right now i don't have <ha> really have a best friend
i really try to i'm
i tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of positive choices so right now i'm just like
um
i really don't have any friends right now
um my personality
um
i'm
a happy person i'm a outgoing person
and
a positive person
and
a good mother
um insecurities like um sometimes i feel like
um i have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something i feel like i can't get through something i can't
get to the next step sometimes or
just
feeling down
sometimes
well i did have a friend and she was like bipolar
and i tried to really be her friend no matter um the disease she had
but
she wasn't a really good friend because she
one day she start
just
um
being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and
it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely
yeah just being friends with certain people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just
don't it just when i notice things about people that should determine whether i wanna be their friend or not you know they might have
bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that that's a red flag and i shouldn't be these
people friends <laughter>
yeah
um to stay in school
stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people
and just
stay on the right track
well i went
um to a friend's house that i haven't seen since childhood
and they
it was just a lot of people over there
and they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed seeing my old friends that i didn't see in a long time
and just being with
my family and
certain friends i really enjoyed because i'm really always in the house i really don't go out that often
so just i enjoyed being with
a group of friends and family and having a good time
yeah
um i'm proud
that
i did get my g_e_d i did graduate
and i do wanna be somebody and i'm very proud that i wanna be a better parent than my parents
thank you <laughter>
goodbye
