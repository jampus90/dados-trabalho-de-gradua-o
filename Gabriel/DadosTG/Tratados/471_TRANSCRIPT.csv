value
<synch>
yes
i'm doing well thank you
from los <l> los angeles
mm sports outdoor sports mainly
surfing uh snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing
traffic
yes
experiencing different cultures
uh well uh i love going to mexico
and uh eh it's so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but
uh the uh the level of
of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds
traveling you mean
uh
i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua
and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes
and uh it's a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible
uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place
i studied biology
uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also
not at all i'm working in
areas of business now
yes i am
my dream job would be to be a missionary
yes
my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very
generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily
but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket
i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that
i exercise
i think i'm pretty good at it uh
uh i think i'm pretty effective at it
it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend
and it was about her uh lack of consideration
um
i felt frustrated
hmm
a situation which
i wished i could handle differently um
i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh
be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior
i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that
is so wrong
and so
in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my
displeasure with someone's actions right away and that
uh takes care of the anger immediately
yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think
eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end
uh it diffuses trouble rather than
prolongs or protracts the trouble
uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued
uh at length for many
months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to
i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh
uh difficult period
in my life
mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their
uh betrayals uh but now i realize that
keeping those memories make me who i am today and
and dealing with them defines who i am today
uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that
um even though my father was somewhat of a uh
hard-handed uh
and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died
and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother
but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect
me also just
just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil
uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um
he's clinically depressed
and he has suicidal tendencies
and uh he's not working he's very highly educated
and he uh well he doesn't talk to me
and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family
yes
you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model
he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest
and kind
uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers
eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two
and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago
um
xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress
i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay
that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future
about whether
i will survive this or not
not really
no
never
never
oh i was either surfing or snowboarding
or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion
funny
jovial
uh uh intelligent a perfectionist
hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um
maybe
uh is to submerge my uh
hedonistic self
i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um
uh deferrer of gratification
he
put
now behind him and he put what will be in the future
in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was
whereas i am looking always for the present
um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to
uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away
<deep breath> it would be
my ex-boss
and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using
uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way
and he continued to use more profanity
until uh
i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred
a year and a half ago
mhm
anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids
sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that
that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had
and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because
that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness
because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not
we do not have the highest
uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree
mm
that's a good one i would say
<laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that
and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so
i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far
i
was giving a
rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing
and many of these people have never done it before
and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so
that was very gratifying to me
<deep breath>
i would say <sigh> my
devotion to
the environment
uh i wasn't always an environmentalist but uh
i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um
uh a steward
of the environment because today they're a lot of peoples people that are
polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and
i stand up and i uh have been on t_v and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment
you're welcome
goodbye
