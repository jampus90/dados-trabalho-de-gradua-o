value
<synch>
yes
doing pretty good thank you
maryland
yes
eighty five
yeah
yeah it is a long time
um not as often as i'd like
um out of work so you know the money issue
yeah
um
maryland
uh is different
it and so the comparison is
the only comparison is that um they're both cities
but uh
maryland has its flavor and l_a has its own flavor so they have unique you know characteristics about themselves
i moved to l_a uh because i was living in hawaii
and um i was out of money
and i just had enough for a plane ticket
uh and come and stay um
uh here in a hotel until i found a job which i did really quickly but anyway so that's why i came here i didn't wanna go home
um
i decided to come here and just start over
i am i am
yeah
um
it was
real easy just did it
i like i like l_a's weather
i like uh the different areas in uh los angeles county
uh west l_a east l_a um
uh i like southern california
you know period so
uh you know i like the people but um
yeah so i like the um
the
attitude you know the l_a attitude so yeah
um
i don't like
um
i don't like some of the uh policies with regard to
um uh the smoking you know i really wish that the
uh
government would crack down on smoking on the streets make it like u_s_c
yeah
no not outside of uh uh
getting on the bus and things like that
i was studying to be a nurse
yeah
i wanted to uh have a job that pays well
but uh afforded me um
the opportunity to use my um service gift
so yeah
no i had to put that uh
put that on the side and uh
i want to get a business degree now
yeah
<laughter>
my dream job is um
is to
create new technology
mm other than to say i would like to uh create something that
would change the world like steve jobs with his iphone
yeah
i am it depends on the situation but i'm more outgoing
i do
tend towards a little shyness from time to time
mhm
mm
mm
<laughter>
um what i do is i'll go to the movies
um i went to the movies probably like uh maybe five weeks ago
yeah
um
well i had a argument recently not really a argument but a disagreement
with a woman at my church who um
is over
this particular department that i'm in
and it's a volunteer position uh
i use my uh administrative assistant um more executive assistant skills
to uh
to uh
i do minutes for meetings that i cover
and um and so then i have to um produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that
and uh this person um
is micromanaging me uh but not micromanaging the other
uh admin assistant who
did not get her block of people into this particular meeting
so the meeting should've been comprised of a hundred people
but we had like maybe thirty no wasn't even thirty twenty
yes <laughter> so um
now she doesn't know that i realize you know that part of it
so um
there was a little bit of a argument and uh but again not a argument but a disagreement
and when we talk again i will
point out to um the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect
and um the the energy she <sh> she's investing
uh in me is uh unprofitable
for what we're trying to achieve
don't that doesn't that sound good <laughter>
yeah
well a little attacked
you know
so
it depends on i'm very good at controlling my temper
it's uh you know there are places where you can
allow your temper to come out
even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot
so uh i'm pretty good at controlling my temper
yeah
um
i don't have any situation
recent that i can think of um
probably say
um
just dealing with a neighbor uh instead of uh
uh responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor altogether so i wish i had done that differently
yeah
hmm
thankfully
i've not had to make that type of decision
in my life as yet
mhm
hmm
um
mm
i have um
what i do in my life and and you know in my
going forward you know um
everything that
i've done and everything that has happened
i
accept it as something that
has to be
to get me to go forward
uh i am a born again christian and so i know that
that god is sovereign over my life
uh and also that according to his word
the bible says that every day of our life is written in his book
so events and circumstances
um
i feel that i feel they are ordained by god now obviously i'm not going to
um jump into a
burning fire or do anything ridiculous
but um
i feel that things that had happened <hap> that have happened even if i've dealt with them the wrong way
uh it's god's
sovereignty <s> his
total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good
so that's how i feel
um
i have all brothers
and so i'm not really that close with my brothers
and my mother
say that again
um people that i've grown up with um
neighbors from when i've
uh when i was younger
uh that i was close to
um uh
different friends
uh that i've had along the way uh friends who
are more like family
so yeah
they've had positive influence
that's i get i sleep too well <laughter>
so i sleep well every night
so
normal
but i my normal i've been feeling my normal
no
no
no
um
that was recent
something happened um
i was um able to participate
um
with um my church on sunday with <wi> i was a pentecost
it was pentecost sunday meaning it was fifty days after the resurrection of jesus christ
and so i was able to participate uh in our prayer
session that we had at my church and uh that was really
made me very happy
so
mhm
that uh i'm smart they would say that i'm smart
that uh
that i handle difficulties very well
um
and that i dress well <laughter>
<laughter>
um
i don't wanna change anything
i do want to just be a better me so be a better person
uh so um
i am working on uh listening better
uh communicating better
uh and and uh accepting my
uh
weaknesses better as well as my strengths
no
mm that's a good question
i would have uh
i would've told myself to
to uh do what i know to do to do what i know
uh that which is right and um ooh xxx
uh to do
what i know is right
and uh let everything else let
the other chips fall where they may
but to do what i know to do is right
and to go forward
um
i am very proud of the fact that
uh i don't give up
bye and thank you
see ya'll <laughter>
