value
<synch>
okay
yes i am
i'm good thank you
<laughter>
originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america
yes
the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to
traffic <laughter> busyness everybody's always in a hurry um
um that's about it
<laughter>
when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to
go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean
the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>
um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from
so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home
so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom
and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way
experiences on vacation or
um most memorable experience
probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so
having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause
no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>
business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field
so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field
my dream job
hmm
well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook
and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family
if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now
but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job
i'm outgoing
<laughter>
<laughter> that's cool <laughter>
uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at
and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e
so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation
figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first
i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with
um i don't really let anything agitate me
and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just
do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it
be who you are and just stay there
actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it
and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways
and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because
the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic
and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard
hmm <sigh> let's see
i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old
and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it
he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him
as opposed to waiting him to call me
and i think
it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come
and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place
but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but
i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult
and then also not expected him to just kinda you know
i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense
woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and
i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so
it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally
so
my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect
so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change
but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just
kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that
i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own
and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but
whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me
it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real
it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy
um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own
and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just
being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that
wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here
so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing
it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure
uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling
but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter
so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me
and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore
and
since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while
um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just
did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of
how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything
physical and and all the material stuff i could care less
but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about
uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that
he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it
bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home
and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through
and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself
in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return
<laughter>
you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day
my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night
i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody
did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma
i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today
and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to
go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day
really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son
my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance
but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle
that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little
mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not
<laughter>
no i haven't thank god
no
really happy let's see
uh it's at home and i think it was when
wow
<mumbling> different things running through my head um
i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on
our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me
and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me
without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself
and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very
tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me
<laughter>
thank you
um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very
you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be
um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do
and i just you know i don't
i don't deal with b s <laughter>
hmm what could i change about myself
uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself
um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um
i think i would just be
a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware
make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody
i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me
so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret
because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that
everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it
what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys
hmm
be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am
to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure
be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me
don't try to revamp <re>
don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not
uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders
but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it
but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments
my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what
at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle
that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary
scrubbed_entry
and i'm always just
true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that
i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from
<laughter>
cool
thank you
bye
