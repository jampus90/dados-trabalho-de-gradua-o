probably uh when i got to study abroad in madrid spain when i was a student at u_c_l_a
uh huh in terms of travel
uh yeah i was um i participated in the uh education abroad program at u_c_l_a where you go live in another country to learn the language and you live there for a year
at the university <univers> and you study at the university
and uh it it was just a memorable year something <someth> an experience that i would never <laughter> forget
thanks
probably more shy but uh sometimes i could be outgoing
um i'm more shy in terms of you know i it takes me it takes time <t> time for me to get to know people i mean i'm not a real party person i don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that
but if i if i'm among friends and things like that then i can be pretty outgoing
with people i know
<laughter>
<laughter>
<laughter>
um drink wine
um
yeah drink wine maybe listen to some uh
nice music
pretty good i can i'm pretty good at controlling my emotions
oh gosh um
i wouldn't say it was a real argument it was more like a what just a
discussion maybe
about
finances maybe
money
um just
oh just a little irritated <laughter>
but um not really
not really strong emotional
uh
wow gosh i <laughter>
i can't think of anything at the moment so uh let's uh skip that one
um
mm maybe uh
eating eating more junk food than i admit to
or
the hardest decision i ever had to make
uh
maybe uh
buying a home <h> buying a home
or remodeling the home
spending money for
uh
i it was um
i felt it was time to move on with my life and uh to uh buy a place for myself so i could be self-sufficient and independent
xxx
yes very happy
thank you
uh an event i could erase from my uh
when i um yeah when i was a student <stud> when i was a student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential and discovered i never enjoyed it
i wanna erase that whole year nineteen eighty three
uh it just brought back horrible <laughter> it just brings back <laughter> horrible memories of uh what i went through when i was student teaching and uh discovered that that
teaching k twelve was not was <w> not for me
i studied <stud> my major was spanish and linguistics
i was very good at foreign languages and i thought um i enjoyed taking them and i was just having a good time taking foreign language and uh
i was getting good grades so i thought maybe this is what i should go into
foreign languages
uh i was teaching <teachi> i was an adult ed teacher teaching english as a second language for thirty years and i just recently uh decided to uh retire myself
um
i have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters my father passed away in two thousand eight and um
uh my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members
yeah
but uh on the xxx on the whole um we have pretty good relation with the rest of my family now
um pretty easy i don't have any problems
um if i don't sleep well i'm i may be moving around in the bed and you know um
messing up the sheets but that doesn't happen too often
oh pretty good i think i've been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anything

uh last time i was really happy
uh probably uh when spring break came around it was uh vacation time and it was time to uh <laughter> go on our trip

it was just a nice getaway relaxing on the uh <laughter> hotel lawn and garden drinking wine
and uh enjoying different sights and eating good food and <laughter>
and buying wine to replenish our dwindling supply at home
<laughter> thanks
uh i think she would describe me as um
eh
kind and sweet and um
motivated and uh just a nice person
oh i'd say sometimes i wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing i guess
i tend to be more reserved
so i wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things but
mm
uh really badly about myself
uh let's see probably when i betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when i uh taped them when i taped them singing christmas carols and i
i played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that
yeah but uh it all it all got resolved at the end we all <laughter> we became <beca> we were all <laughter> it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part
but it worked out okay
yeah
um probably having
done what i did by <laughter> playing it to other people
uh
what advice would i give myself
ten or twenty years ago um
uh don't give up just uh keep uh <laughter> keep pursuing what you want and uh never never give up xxx
see it as a
and as a disappointment if nothing <noth> if it doesn't work out
um
i'm a i'm a good listener
um i'm a
i'm a motivated person i'm hardworking i'm conscientious i'm caring
um
i'm generally a pretty happy type person
