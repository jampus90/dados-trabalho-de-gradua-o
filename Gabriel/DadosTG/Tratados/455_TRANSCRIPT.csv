value
<synch>
yes
very well
uh ohio
mhm
uh finished school and came out to start my life
uh not often now
not really often
uh because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home
prior
uh there's really not a comparison
you know this is warm and
sunny
and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment
i it took a minute
to get adjusted to the different culture
but uh after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here
uh i love the weather
i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains
and um so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here
uh i
tend to not have things that i don't like
uh because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there
so and i like me so that means that there's really nothing i don't like
yes i do
uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences
and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between
uh all types of people
it's a very rich experience
um
which one
to where
uh i
guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there
uh as i go
the people and the
warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue
through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that
there are so many there really are
but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque
which was just really pure and it
really stayed with me how similar
we actually all are
um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips
uh there
and
let's see
just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too
wow i've studied lots of different things i've studied law i've studied um
entertainment i've studied communications i've studied
whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman
<laughter>
<laughter>
ah it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy
keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive
and um just allows me to be able to
be fully developed as a human being being able to do that
mhm
um
i don't have a dream job
per se
what i do have is a um
desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose
on a daily basis so
uh probably more outgoing
mhm
<laughter>
well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform
before i move uh around i get exercise
so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving
and uh then move forward from there
uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have one anymore
argued
um
cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument
um
don't know what it's about
i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money
situation i wish i had handled differently
you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets
to hold guilt about the way anything
uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences
uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as
needing them to be different i need to learn from them
or to um just really accept what is
mhm
hardest decision i've ever had to make
um
don't really have a quote on quote hard
decision you know because i grew up in a way
uh where my mother was extremely
wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life
and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say
it's your life
and so
um for me decisions don't really come
as difficult to make
they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood
so i don't really have a
most difficult
decision i've ever made
mm
event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to
erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase
uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow i'm out
uh
great uh a little more
uh
physical exertion than normal 
but uh still great
<laughter>
mm no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to
the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty
even tempered
no
mm
no
uh that's pretty much every day
<laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm thankful i'm grateful
for my life and uh i'm just thankful for everything that comes into it
uh
very smart uh
very loving uh very intelligent
funny
uh outgoing
that's probably probably what my friends would say
uh there's really nothing that i think i need
<laughter> to to do or to have or to be different uh about myself
like i'm okay with everything the way it is
really am
<laughter>
what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago
to know
um
to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago
was important in terms of developing the person that i am now
and
so to just
be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to
learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up
recently really enjoyed
uh
uh cooked a very wonderful meal
um 'cause i love cooking
so that was something i really enjoyed
mhm
wow my my willingness to get to know myself
through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application
of everything that i've learned about people cultures
places and most importantly
you know
the god within me
bye
