value
<synch>
yes
spectacular
this is an interesting experiment
<laughter>
uh i'm from middle of nowhere iowa
<sigh> uh
may second of two thousand seven
so exactly five years six years ago
um
infrequently like once every couple years
uh the weather exists so it's more extreme
and then  it's
rather less
exciting
a lot less colorful
uh winter in minnesota <laughter>
uh it took approximately
the drive in that's that's about all it took the lights uh
the lights took care of the rest
uh
i really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime so that bycicles uh
have free rein of the streets i like all the art i love
the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here
oh you know
the traffic <sigh>
the exceedingly high cost of living
uh
yeah those are those are my big beefs
uh not nearly as much as i would like to
i've done a little bit
uh i like not
knowing exactly how things are gonna go i like the fact that it forces me to
uh deal with people to
deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to
uh
last year i got to
hang out in san marcos for a little bit
after i split up with my ex
and then
after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles
<laughter>
uh
last week
managed to go on a bike ride for cyclavia
scrubbed_entry
as a <laughter> he was basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made he made a bunch of like
national news and
he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group
riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didn't
bat an eye we didn't blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday
but
our group of friends
is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else
<laughter>
i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles
um
<clears throat>
once i found the right group of friends
it was easy to be social it it
drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing
bombastic for the first time and it stuck
um
if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out
i i do all sorts of stuff
it um
usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project
uh what temper <laughter>
uh
scrubbed_entry
um
<laughter> panicked 'cause i really wanted to make him not hate me
and i mostly failed
uh
hard on him
i mostly uh mostly got by with
a couple of scrapes on my ego
uh
when 
when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of
having my <sigh>
verbal gloves up i managed to
take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was
not my most graceful moment
uh
i feel guilty about lots of stuff um
i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else
'cause i really love junk food it's really good i have very little food willpower 'cause i used to be a fat guy
i'm not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was
uh made a lot of hard decisions
i guess <sigh>
it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff
but
it wasn't even that hard 'cause it pushed me to do it so
it's a tricky question madam
uh oh you know broken collarbone
severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time
<laughter>
mm
no
my memories are important
i have lived a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe i like this universe
<laughter>
uh
my little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me
uh
my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy
uh
but
since most of the rest of them live so far away don't really have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparce
uh
jackrabbit's been a pretty positive influence on me lately
she is a magical creature
uh
well there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful
there's the part where she
manages to
hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she
actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part
where
she is a hundred percent kind and caring
all the time
all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that
she does this all
without wanting anything in return
i don't know that's
<sigh> smitten <laughter>
uh
<laughter> what a funny question how do i know them as though she's multiple people how did you know
uh
i know her through my
bicycle friends <sigh>
uh
the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland i'm pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits
so
i i get to sleep
poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter
<deep breath> less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life
uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire
um mm
because
the universe
in its
infinite
uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor
uh has managed to convince me of the
reality
of magic
in the arthur c clark sense
uh so
as a fortunate and <cough>
vaguely aware being
eh it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this
uh
yeah
uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate
and i'm feeling more and more inspired all the time
if i could just work on the motivation i'd be set
mm not since you asked me on the form a little while ago no
uh no i used to think i had it but who knows at this point that was awhile ago
uh
i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and
started having fun mm and then that's uh yeah the rest is ancient history
um
twenty thirteen <laughter>
uh
<sigh> working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling uh
an art project that all my friends
helped and put on that's that was really nice it's a nice feeling
<laughter>
<sigh>
that's a very good question i'm not actually sure i'll ask him later today though
um
i guess i'm
enthusiastic
i am
thesauric
and i am
<sigh>
i'm gonna have to say
highly analytical <laughter>
uh
it'd be nice if i could get my super powers back that'd be pretty cool
uh
like turning on some of the fancier
finely tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself
<laughter>
uh
that's a really tough one
i think the thing that i'm most proud of
would probably be
<sigh>
you know i'm not actually sure
<laughter>
oh all sorts of stuff but i'm working on that
<clears throat>
<deep breath>
don't masturbate so much <laughter>
uh jackrabbit
really bad puns uh and dessert
<laughter>
no problem
bye ellie
