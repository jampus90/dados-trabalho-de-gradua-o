i'm in a weird test study right now
uh i'm from los angeles
mhm
<ss> all kinds of different things to do in this city
uh
well
i don't know each each area is a little different and it's hard to get boring around here
oh you know the traffic and the smog and all that
not as much as i'd like to
mm money mainly
lack of money
i like seeing the world and seeing all the different places
went to uh went to russia three years ago
yeah
i like to go into the churches we did a huge trip of all the churches in the area
uh
music for the most part
uh i been playing music for a long time
yeah
xxx musician touring performing musician
really really really hard
<ss> a lot of competition and luck involved
i agree
little of both i suppose
<laughter>
again probably just i i play a lot of music
sit down with a guitar for a little while
i would say good i think i'm a calm person
i'm having difficulty even remembering <laughter> uh
nothing big in a long time
mm
i'm having difficulty thinking of one on the spot right now
the hardest decision i've ever had to make
<laughter> uh
i i'm not sure i i can't think of anything
guilty um <laughter>
<laughter> when i was a boy
i stole a little golden bicycle from an old lady
i'm not proud of it <laughter>
<laughter>
um
""
it's <ts> not ideal
i live with my parents i'm twenty three years old
and that's becoming more and more awkward
i think
i don't know i think things are improving i need to move out
i need to get my own apartment and uh
then we can come back around and be friends i'm sure with my parents
just uh there's a lot of positive <laughter> influences in my life i've got a good group of friends you know my family i love them nonetheless but
easy i would say
mhm
um
just uh not uh not as groggy as some people get i don't know i
just in general uh
well
i'd say
things are alright
um
no nothing huge
no
mm mm
last time i i had a really good band practice last night with all the friends i felt really good about that
mhm
think generally funny and good to be around
uh work ethic i think is a big one
sure uh
you know i i have a lot of projects i've planned for myself in my life and i have difficulty completing them
i like to use space as an excuse that's my go-to one uh
i don't have a good studio to record music or
um
well okay this uh this current band that i'm working with um
i
was told i'm a part time member in this band and i was told that uh
you know i wasn't officially in the core group and stuff i felt pretty bad about that for a few days
it's alright <laughter>
uh
in life
maybe going maybe finishing college that might be something
not
um
i don't know i just never
i i never came to pass that i would transfer to
a four year university and get a bachelor's degree
best qualities i think
generally that easygoingness and
good sense of humor
i did recently that i really enjoyed
last weekend i went camping on a beach with a bunch of friends that was nice
yeah
most proud of um
i guess you know musical accomplishments i've put a lot of work into that and i'm finding success in my way
<laughter>

thank you that was interesting
goodbye
