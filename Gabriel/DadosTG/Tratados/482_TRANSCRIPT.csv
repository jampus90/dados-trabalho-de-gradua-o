value
<synch>
yes
i'm doing fine
i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah
i was yes
uh i've never been back there
um
don't have any relatives there
don't have a reason to go back there
um
<makes sound with mouth>
<laughter> well my my family's here
that's one uh the weather's great
uh the beaches and mountains are here
all those things are very good
uh the traffic
which is probably <probab> probably most people say
um
it's expensive to live here
those are probably the top two
uh recently i've traveled
um
well you get to see new places and and new people
you get to learn more about other cultures
and uh different ways people think
oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week
uh
um i spent most of most of one day with
with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got
um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid
trying to
you know say you know what's this what's this
uh it was very humbling
um
you know just just seeing that
you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult
i'm probably more of a shy person
genetics i don't know why
um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction
i've also studied uh computer networking
um
it was
i guess
just uh kinda circumstances
i needed
the
the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family
and
i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain
mm
uh it's given me a lot of opportunity
but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life
well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary
uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall
uh for four years
and last year we we trained in north carolina
for one year
um and that was like theology and bible training
um
basically god put
a um
a desire in my heart to get beyond
get beyond myself and and do something for other people
to to go and
and learn about another people their culture
and to share the gospel with them
well in my immediate family
um
i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters
and then um
but i i have one older brother
uh no sisters
um
so what what do you wanna know about my family
um
i'm really close with my wife and my daughters
uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped
um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old
even though he's he's five years older than me
so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him
but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents
um
i'd say my
my youth pastor in high school
he was a real real positive influence in me
um
just he has a
he has a drive and a zeal for
for pursuing the truth
um
and just uh
studying the bible and
and because of his influence that kinda
put me on a path to wanting to study the bible
um i think i've gotten better at it
there have been
times when
you know i'll i'll get angry
and uh
you know it can just
kinda really rule over me just the frustration
and i'm the type of person that it takes me
um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to
to calm down again
but i've
i've learned um
over time that really getting angry
um and keeping that anger in doesn't
it doesn't
attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me
and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to
to keep so
when <whe> when things anger me i try to
uh
like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it
and and resolve it and come to a resolution
um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem
um <sigh>
well a
a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago
um
my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents
and her parents had already left
um eh we were just driving down to
orange country area for this trip
and
my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed
and
but hadn't really
in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had
and so
when i was trying to meet those expectations
she
um
you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted
um and kinda getting attacked for it
so
so then i i i started yelling at her
and
and we you know we had that conflict but then
you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through
and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was
um
are you asking the moment of during the conflict
uh
very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it
in your body
um
part partly i
the i guess the
anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger
so
i would think um
yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger
mm hmm hmm hmm
i guess it was um
deciding to go
um to go to our training last year
um i i felt that god had put on my heart that
that this was something i was supposed to pursue
um my wife didn't feel that way
and
i
i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue
and
but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart
so
i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it
um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um
you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going
uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh
you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do
um
but then after i kinda gave that up
then
um
then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so
um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me
tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory
um
oh let me see
i'm not sure um
i don't know i i can't really
think of anything very traumatic
um that i would wanna erase but i i think
you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda
shape who we are
and
so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase
um usually
usually it's not too bad
um
are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping
um
the the job i work the
the um
kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i
so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts
or graveyard shifts
so
um
coming home in the morning
you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep
but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work
uh it pretty easy
um
when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky
uh
i i've been feeling good lately
no not really
no
no
um
hmm
i don't know um
can't think of anything that was
kinda out of the ordinary
but
um
yesterday
we my wife and i took
took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one
um stayed with her grandma
but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played
and
yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park
um
i i think he'd say i'm a
a family man
that um
i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me
um usually my my friend i end up doing
um
different work around the house for him
'cause i'm kind of a handyman so
so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice
um
i guess i would um
i guess i would like to be able to
um
start conversations with people
easier
uh sometimes
i have i have trouble
just talking to people
especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them
but kinda talking to people in a group
uh i wish i was a little better at that
now if it's
okay
what what i was gonna say right before that was that um
uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult
uh
advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago
um
probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life
um
that's about it
think that would made that would've made the biggest difference
in my life i think
um
well i have i have four kids and
i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that
that um
you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them
through their their journey in life and i hope that they
end up a little
better for it than
than me
um
yeah i just hope
hope kinda through them
that i can
you know
leave <lea> leave something worthwhile
you're welcome
goodbye
