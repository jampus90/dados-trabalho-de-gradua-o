value
<sync>
yes
okay other than this laryngitis i have
uh cleveland ohio
in uh
seventy nine i think it was <laughter>
mhm
um
once a year
something like that or less
um uh there's a lot more to do here
um
they're a little more narrow minded
back there and republican <laughter>
um well originally show business
but probably to get away from uh
cleveland
it was very difficult at first
um i'm not used to uh change i don't like change very much you know
having to
uh meet new people and
figure out how to make a living
well
i like
the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness
the movies um
the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather
um the driving the congestion
some of the
superficial attitude
the importance mhm
um well not a lot but i do
i just came back from vegas to
visit relatives we met there
and i'm going to mexico
um next month
um
well seeing the different
cultures like been to europe
greece france <p> um italy
um
i like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona
i never saw sedona that was really uh
an experience
pure peaceful
about sedona
yeah
well sedona's a very
energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat
kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful
uh pine trees
and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and
and after a day the pain in my back went away
that i had there for months
so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy
so it was really um
very mystical
in life <laughter>
or in sedona in life
um
well being on stage in boston
and um that was great i i loved doing that
um
um just being with friends and laughing
are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically
well um
i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events
and um
i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and
just laugh and
and
i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but
just being with somebody who's in tune with
my sense of humor and uh gets
my jokes and
you know i get his and we're
just um enjoying that moment
um speech and drama
i i majored in
uh no not now
i always was interested in um
musical comedy when i was a child i would
sing along to records in my living room
and i was always in choirs
in school and then when i
uh went to high school i joined the drama club
and i i just always had an interest and i always had a
a big personality and
well <laughter>
um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore
i'm sixty and
i don't know if i
have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything
right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just
um
relax and travel but um
i i like being creative
in in any way i can i like independence
and i kind of have that right now so
i'm okay
um
well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded
and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for
um gosh since nineteen eighty eight
and um i'm
a district leader in my community
and we have meetings and that really helps to
center me and bring out my higher self
so if i get tense or nervous i i chant
um sometimes okay sometimes not
a lot yes yes <laughter>
less and less though it's been happening less and less
but um
yeah sometimes it's got it's
it's um
created difficulties
well
i can't <c> <sigh>
i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like
was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving
and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway
about four miles out of our way and i just
i got very angry for about
thirty seconds and then i had to
calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it
so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but
i felt kind of
bad that i overreacted
um
you mean in my life <laughter>
manys
yes
um
gosh there's so many <laughter>
i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing
information
like
they're not gonna use me on a job or something
that i would
take an attitude that
um
i'll find something better it's okay and
move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me
and
you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and
you know that
whole uh
thought process that really doesn't help the situation
and i do that more often
but i
since i started chanting
but it doesn't you know
i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where
i can do that
um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what
television to buy or something <laughter> but um
um
i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences
and um
um
or leaving my  comfort
zone <z> place
if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place
that would be a very difficult decision for me
and probably leaving a relationship
very hard because
you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship
so i usually
live it out til
it's for you know it's
they leave or something you know it's very hard for me
to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on
so what i usually do is i don't make the decision
and i end up suffering
but longer
so
mhm
can we move on
um
well
uh it's hard
because um i don't know if it's because i have pain
in my back
and neck
but
i i it's difficult for me to
stay asleep i'd i i
i don't get a um
a deep sleep
um
but
at because of
uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil
and that's been putting me to sleep so
i have been um
sleeping better because of it
but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell
but before that all happened
i was um
finding it difficult to stay asleep
and so therefore i'm tired during the day and
uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable
but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or
emotional things or or or or not
i'm sorry could you repeat that
have i studied changes in my behavior
uh no <laughter>
i was not
no
mm mm
oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know
well i uh
was going to um
vegas to
meet my family was my
my family was flying in from cleveland to
uh there we have a
a relative in uh vegas
and i drove with my friend
and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday
so
we all went and
had a good time in vegas
i mean i was struggling through my cold but
but it was fun it was nice
well <laughter>
uh they think i'm funny um
they feel that i say it like it is
um
they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so
people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me
'cause i'll
i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic
but just <ju> that's just the way i talk
so
um my um
the
anger that sometimes wells up in me
you know i just
but although that that really made me i think
a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your
experiences make you who you are
and how you handle them
makes you who you are and if you don't have those
lows you don't really know what highs are
so i don't
i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever
but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today
and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these
moments where i've
just blurt out you know anger or something
i just wish that would happen more less
that the anger parts would happen less
and they are so
i guess it will <laughter>
happen less
um
don't give up hope live in the moment
and um
everything will everything will work out everything will work out
and if you believe that
then you really have nothing to fear
um
the fact that now
and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been
cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become
more um
compassionate person
and i'm able to um
uh
<ss> understand people better
and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too
and
that
if you if you treat people
from that respect that they're
they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because
you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally
and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate
you're you're happy and your life is happy
okay
