value
<synch>
<clears throat>
yes
i'm doing fine thank you
i'm from los angeles
california yes
um well the main thing i like the weather um i like the lifestyle i like um the variety of beach um snow
we have it all
um some things i don't like about l_a um
the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous
um i have i'm well-traveled
um i enjoy seeing new places going new places um it's different everywhere the people are different
um it's fun
um okay well the most recent is last year i went to family reunion in new orleans so that was in june
and um while i was there we also visited slidell louisiana for the um
the swamp tours
and vicksburg mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in ferriday lousiana with my aunt who will be a hundred and one
this year in may
um there's a lot um
as far as traveling or just period
uh most memorable experience um well i don't know if it's just one
um probably when
i used to travel with my dad that's where i got a lot of my traveling from
um yeah it was bus car sometimes planes uh mostly what just i guess i'll say mostly down south but it was
really fun
especially the road trips
mhm
um just general and also drama
uh well my dream job is
to become a real estate investor
um well i've sort of really been into it ever since two thousand five um i just don't have the capital right now or the connections that um
since i do like real estate i'm just going to start off as a real estate agent
so i should have my license um sometime this year
outgoing
um well i'm not shy um it could be a little bit of both but um i'm pretty outgoing
um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap <laughter>
um take a bath
um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways
um it needs to be worked on but um
i know when to control it
um when i need to
um
well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but
um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but
um that's usually how it goes <laughter>
um
well
i xxx don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it
so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess
um
probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um
situation i wish i would've handled differently um just
kind of everything in my life almost <laughter> i could've done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it 'cause i don't regret anything that i've done in my life
the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that
mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions
um it was just a lot of um
a lot of stuff through the years um <clears throat> the relationship had kind of deteriorated um
if the relationship
between us was still good
then the things that he were doing um
i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um i've i would feel like well our relationship is good and
it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and
problems financial problems and he's doing this so um
i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but
eh you know he didn't wanna cooperate so
um
well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes
um
something i can erase um
mm i don't think i really need to erase anything um
i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase
um it's fair slash good um there's no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems
um well i would have to say my mother
yes
um well she's just always supported me and
everything that i've done um whether it's
good or not so good so um i think that's a blessing
mhm
um sometimes sometime it's not
um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is as i would like to um sometimes
so um that's more the problem i would like to get
mhm
um just sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap
um i've been feeling fine
mhm
uh no they've been about the same
no
no
um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so <laughter>
um well i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my um entertainment friend that i've been knowing since ninety six
i really wouldn't
i'm not gonna say i don't consider him a best friend but we don't really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom
mhm
so
um
well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in
but maybe after the classwork is out of the way um <laughter> maybe i can do something else
uh myself well i do wish that um
at times i could control my temper a little more and um of course i would like to lose weight
um be a little bit more active and um i wish my skin would clear up
um it was probably when i was in school um school years are terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals
so um they try to make you feel like um you're nothing like you're
piece of dirt under their foot so that's probably the last time as an adult no
um i would say that i'm genuine um i'm honest um i'm supportive
and um i'm just a good friend
no
um well uh twenty years ago um
just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you
<laughter> um that's the main thing um i'm going to tell my daughters no
um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um there's no need to gain eighty pounds when
the baby is just twenty pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose
um also if i came into any money now twenty years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um
just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it
um so yeah i think that's about it <laughter>
um proud of uh <sigh>
mm i guess maybe myself um
my kids
k thank you
bye
