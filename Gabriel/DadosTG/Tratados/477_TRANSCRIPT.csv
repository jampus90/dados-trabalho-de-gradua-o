value
<synch>
yes thanks
i'm well thank you how are you
i grew up in oklahoma
mhm
um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here
my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much
<sniffle>
oklahoma's very different um
uh l_a's a lot more exciting
there's a lot more um
uh to do here and um
uh the ocean obviously is very nice so
um
you know that's a good question i um
i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and
i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come
very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made
<laughter>
pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural
it seemed like a good fit
um i just really like it here
oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach
um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or
um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice
mm
i studied philosophy and um political theory and government
and did a little bit of english literature on the side
um it
kind of just happened naturally i think uh
i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different
areas and
i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that
um
not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities
um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often
<laughter> um
you know i have actually studied to become a success coach
um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice
aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students
um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams
um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that
um
you know it can be challenging for people to actually
be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um
undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it
uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too
um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so
um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people
i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged
and i think that um is
something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted
um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers
<laughter> pretty good i think
um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time
not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no
hmm
hmm
i'm not sure
it would've probably been a discussion over politics
and it probably would've been a friendly argument
um
probably with one of my liberal friends so
but i actually can't remember the specific time
<laughter>
<sniffle>
mm
i meditate
um i
do that almost every day
um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful
um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts
so that's nice
mm
well let me think about that for a minute
<sigh>
hmm
<laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um
just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>
<sigh>
hmm
okay i'm sorry <laughter>
hmm
well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly
um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but
um i do have it sometimes
probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it
you know if i didn't have it
um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um
it's usually me in school somewhere
at the end of the semester
haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail
and
you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i
study and attend class the way i should have
um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating
and i'm not exactly sure
why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so
no i don't think so
um at least not not that i'm aware of
<sniffle>
i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew
and they live on the east coast
and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um
i when i used to live there when he was younger
um spent a lot of time with them and
since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so
for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back
in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them
um and that i felt bad about because
we really enjoy each other's company and he
um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back
so that's um
that makes me feel bad sometimes
mm
um
well i have a brother i'm very close to him
he's younger
and
um he's like four four and a half years younger
he's married um i have a nephew
um my both of my parents have passed away
so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them
um
on my father's side there's one brother
um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are
<sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um
most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um
so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then
but you know we're not that close with our extended family so
um
i'd say well
um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences
scrubbed_entry
when i came out to california
um
i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um
it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so
um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and
um we just established this really strong friendship and
she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um
but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um
and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know
i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice
i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um
sometimes my you know
depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but
um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful
um and i can sleep
uh
you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles
so
um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination
um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night
or at least if i do i don't remember it
so
um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit
because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home
most of the time but then i travel
like one week a month
and when i travel i'll take the red-eye
um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i
um sleep
poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep
and the first day
after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay
but usually the second day is not very good
um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate
and um
i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle
i would say good
um
summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little
um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about
um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good
not really i can't i can't think of anything um
there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um
and i hike with friends and
um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated
um because i didn't really exercise when i was there
and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like
it's okay
thank you
no
no
hmm well
scrubbed_entry
he's a lot of fun and
um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and
we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and
um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun
hmm
<sigh>
well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun
but that i can be serious
and um
that i you know care about others
uh
and that i'm loyal
and
i'm not sure what else
um
i think those those are probably the main things
<sniffle>
um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so
um
i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem
uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar
i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging
um and i wish that i um
xxx
i don't know
uh
i think i wish that i was in a relationship
so
probably those things
mm
hmm
so at the last organization i used to work at
i had a boss and she was
i don't feel like she was um
i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh
used to push my buttons or so i thought
and so um
one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer
um and he was upset about something and
it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was
um
but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i
have very strong opinions about how you handle
challenges with people <peo> with staff members
and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought
um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel
um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it
and um
i did you know
i tried to be very calm and
said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but
uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there
to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me
or after we had that interaction so
<laughter>
so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this
thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had
read it back then
which is
um when you think about buying something instead of thinking
uh oh
here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it
it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that
because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it
you know
intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so
you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh
been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
<sigh> probably
scrubbed_entry
um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them
and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them
so
<sigh> let's see
well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore
uh and i got to fly first class
um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um
tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because
um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too
sure
thank you
bye
