value
<synch>
<laughter>
yes
i'm doing well
i was born in oakland
um <sigh> all the different areas of the city
uh the different cultures that are here
the traffic the
um lack of public transportation
and the superficiality
<laughter>
i i don't i would love to travel more
um <sigh>
being able to experience a different way of living
um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and
getting a different perspective
um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months
and i was in bahia which is in the north and um
let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family
um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um
they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting
um
i think taking a bus by myself to
a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go
yeah
right now i'm getting my master's in social work
<laughter>
dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and
how to um
how to intervene effectively with different cultures
and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel
um
basically that those would be the main characteristics
i think that's a false dichotomy
but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone
and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful
<laughter>
um i listen to music
and just lay on my bed and
um
i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things
also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise
pretty good i don't get angry a lot
um
so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that
hmm
um
mm what month is this may
probably two months ago
and i argued
via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but
i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor
um
with a friend i've had for a few years
i felt anxious
um
sad and angry
um
yeah those are the main emotions
i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them
and then i'll notice the physical
uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty
if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me
hmm <laughter>
that i wish i had handled differently
i guess related to this argument um
i went out one night and got
a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up
calling a person for a ride
home but that
really upset that person
and i know that
it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um
it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did
mm
<clears throat>
hardest decision <sigh>
wow um
probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards
well after dropping out i had to really
rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to
dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on
um <sigh>
i think by recognizing what i don't want to do
and doing a lot of research on
program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program
<sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh>
oh <laughter>
um
revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier
it was a dating relationship and
a few years ago we had a falling out
over his treatment of me
and it involved
another person and i wish i could
get that out of my mind
um <laughter>
<laughter>
i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten
um closer to her as an adult
uh we talk pretty regularly
with my dad i grew up with him
mostly he lives in atlanta and
um we don't talk as much but
we are
we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that
contentious or anything
and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family
um so
in general i'm not really that close to family
um
one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five
and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really
opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things
<sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up
because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day
and the thought of it is
you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired
not really feeling refreshed
<clears throat>
i think just <sigh>
self-talk about how what i have to do
isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year
um
trying to think of things that
i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music
and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going
<sigh> feeling <sigh>
uh wow um
feeling
emotionally drained on some ways and
at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown
so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of
feeling accomplished and proud at the same time
no i haven't
yes
in two thousand six
the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um
i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous
and just all those changes going on
really um
exacerbated 
things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there
and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed
yes i do
yes
i notice
i'm better able to
accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them
i'm <sigh>
able to think <th>
think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light
and also identify
the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas
<clears throat>
mm <sigh>
um this past weekend
i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again
<laughter> um <sigh>
people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very
um analytical
sensitive intelligent
intellectual
um
i wish that i did not
or wait
i wish
i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on
and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy
<laughter>
start going to therapy now <laughter> um
but yeah i really would and
also
to
what how old am i twenty eight
ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school
i would <sigh> tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future
and to seek out mentors to get a clearer um idea of what i wanted to do as a career
um
i think the fact that i'm in grad school
and
coming from the background that i that i come from
low socio-economic status and
just pushing through
challenges to get here
<laughter>
you're welcome
bye
