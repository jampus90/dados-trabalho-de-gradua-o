value
<synch>
yes
i'm doing fine
uh mexico
uh when i was young seven years old
i've been there like uh three or four times for vacation
well it's uh less stressful i don't know if it's because i'm on vacation but
i feel more at peace over there than here
well my uh family moved down here for a better life uh that was my parents
mm just the weather and the different things that you could do you could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains different variety of things to do
the traffic and sometimes <somet> yeah basically the traffic and yeah that's one of the main things
not that much i been to new york and uh mexico only
uh just uh seeing new places and finding new locations you know something new
like for a trip or
well i've been to uh in mexico i've been to the pyramids of uh
i forgot what's it called in mexico city
and i like you know about uh finding about my ancient culture since i'm uh uh mexican from mayan aztec so i like to see different things like that
well uh at school
well i did uh drop out but i came back and i'm trying to get back into it right now trying to learn uh graphic designs
well i started liking you know to take pictures doing different things and i like you know
uh going into business i like what the it entitles about
i wanna have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free
and don't being relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself
outgoing
well i just like to you know
be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how i feel around 'em
i like to hear music or you know
do do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind
well i'm getting better at it
you know
i xxx
well it was like uh
two days ago it was something about uh i needed to pay a bill or something <some> something that uh i you know i had taken care of
but the person he's like more picky about it you know he's more
you know how how girls are you know they they want everything right there and then
i have it handled you know i have it everything there and they just bugging sometimes they don't give you the space
that you need to resolve something
well i felt like i was overwhelmed i already had it resolved i just was waiting for
a check you know that's not on my control but i already had made the paper proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it and it's like
you're making you know an argument you know a storm in a glass of water
it's like mhm
well
uh differently there's couple of them but not so recently because i've been more
trying to get my life together but the decisions i made before in the past
like dropping out of school and doing other different things
mm
guilty not that much because
not really
not that i could think right off the top of my head
the hardest decision
oh it's just not on top of my head right now
an event
mm well the only things that i remember is when i black out or different things like that that i don't remember
but
not nothing like a particular only when my uh brothers died and different things like that
mhm
well my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble
and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it
no i'm hispanic i you know i like to be with my family
and you know i i like to go over there to mexico too i have a half-sister and my grandpa died he was over there in mexico
so i do uh like to have a good relationship with my family
well
my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they had to do to pay the bills that's why sometimes i be like you know running around trying to get everythings done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out
it's a little hard because there eh especially here in los angeles there's a lotta
different things that you could get into that's not that positive
and it's hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff
well normally i just knock out it's not that hard it's like it takes me like half an hour or fifteen minutes but
uh sometimes i can't even wake up even with the alarm
uh they have to wake me up you know my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on it's like so
hard so you know i just knock out
i do get a little either i'm angry or i don't feel good and i'm not filled with energy
but i still have to know i know i have to do something so i still go through with it
i been well i been uh feeling good you know
been a little restless but not that much i had to do stuff so
i just you know put myself to do it no matter how i feel
no
nothing out of the ordinary
no
no
the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know going out with a
going out have some fun and you know i was drinking and just relaxing
and winding <win> winding down
mhm
my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax
but nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home
but without getting any calls or xxx interruptions you know just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just
be with her doing the other different things
mhm
uh like an outgoing guy you know very social but at the same time i'm reserved depending how i feel with people
have to you know build trust or feel comfortable with them
oh i'm changing a lot you know like
uh my temper and different things drinking things i'm
changing a little different things so i could get more different things done
oh there's several but mostly uh
is when i'm coming from mexico that they wanna demeander you even down there it feels uh like silly because i went to a store i was regularly dressed
and i was telling 'em i wanted to buy something and then they said that
that i i wasn't belong there and i and as soon as they saw my credit card they kinda changed perspective because they saw the wells fargo logo they know i was american
but they thought it was like you know
it it was <wa> it felt me it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place and you have the money you ask for something you're gonna ask for something because you have it not just to waste <wa> kill their time
just because they saw a logo of a card
that's how they you know
it just it was ridiculous for me
no
basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school
and you know don't go you know try to control my temper and do different things because if i knew what i know now back then it'd be different
well uh i did drop out but i did uh go back to school and i you know i did get my high school
and right now i'm in the process of doing other different things so right now is uh getting my high school getting that together
and right now i'm working to another goal trying to get you know my either going back to school so it's basically <ba> basically getting back to school and finishing the high school the g_e_d
mhm
okay
you're welcome
bye
