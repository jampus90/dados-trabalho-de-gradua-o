value
<synch>
yes
i'm doing pretty good
i was born and raised right here in los angeles
<sigh> um the weather
um
would be number one i also like the diverse uh
cultures
i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do
and there's a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids
and um i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school
um learn about different people
the traffic the cost of living
um
sometimes i think it's too big
and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or
you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation
i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years
so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere
i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been
and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city
you know things like that
um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year
um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about
three <thr> i think three to four days
and i got to see the capitol
um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house
the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings
and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy
but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes
but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back
um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii
um
actually maui
that was actually two three three years ago three years ago
in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and
i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day
um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins
boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight
they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but
five years apart technically
and they're just super super
typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty
um they're teenage years
um my youngest
um
still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old
so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well
just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how
just with love and nurturing and um
the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with
you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into
you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages
and seeing how they have developed and you know
seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years
and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back
um
mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say
um
for me being a single parent is um the financial
um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing
um
you know the
just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the
uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself
you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice
uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges
um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and
you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with
well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um
i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and
pray a lot and meditate
um
if i see i need a little help if if
you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or
you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just
trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably
um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology
and now i'm studying business <laughter>
i just thought that you know um
there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs
and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better
um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um
with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um
are kinda
become
you know harder to obtain
so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic
and um
you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see
um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately
would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations
um trying different foods out um writing about different people
cultures um
learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the
you know the the people there and um
being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um
it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area
if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that
um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy
and um not so much shy as i am reserved now
um
but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm
checking everything everybody else out
and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people
but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk
um you know
i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can
attach myself to one or two people and
you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person
<laughter>
um
for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging
everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments
meditating
praying or reading a good spiritual scripture
um
if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage
maybe get a facial
um
you know things that will
i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension
um
and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or
i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach
i like <li> also like to just maybe
go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or
maybe go window shopping you know things like that
mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper
as i am i just i'm more impatient
unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations
so i just can become really irritated or irritable
um
quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just
lose patience um outside of that
i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and
be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is
like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be
i do try to be patient and understanding
'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me
um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone
um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse
so i am conscious of it i try to be
aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and
just lose it
um <sigh>
well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say
because it was not a personal
contact
but a company i eh we
it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the
response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth
very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her
so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know
i just kinda like reached my boiling point
to say the least and was really upset and
eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument
but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two
probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express
um
or actually it was on sunday yeah and um
i know
the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation
and it not be resolved it just takes you there so
um
just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um
and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact
and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised
<clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that
just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know
go back and
pull from those and
you know do my own sense of feedback and
see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and
and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite
<sigh>
mm
well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two
and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um
it just was not a good time
and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time
and um i wasn't comfortable
with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but
he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy
and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about
that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again
i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been
probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um
being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest
thank you
no
mm mm
no
um okay you know um
i was laid off in december
so i've been constantly
trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet
so that's been a little tough i've had i've had to face a lot of challenges
and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school
so i my <m> my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off
you know in the same place
um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating
in next month from u_s_c with her master's in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently
although i've very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me
well
i'm really good with um people i communicate well
i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um
although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person
um
i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so
if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing
um
but probably like interior decorating
anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays
um
i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so
um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening
i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot
and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um
i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has
to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents
um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces
but um i'm i'm
really good with people just you know period
you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well
mm not really
some of the situations um i wish i would've waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children um picked a different partner
um
and i say that i mean my son's father is great but um
a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me we're not together we haven't been together in years but
i'm just saying overall i think um had i
yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and
i think that's
that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do
stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and
stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you
mm
um i think i'm pretty stable and consistent just
with overall i think um how i face adversity how i face <f> i
face things you know um
i am a pretty committed person i try to you know if i say imma do something i try to stick to it i'm a very loyal friend
um and um i'm proud of the fact that i've i've maintained and done a pretty good job with raising my kids solo
okay
great thank you
bye bye
