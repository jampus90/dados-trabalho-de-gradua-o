value
<synch>
yes
i'm wonderful how are you
california
mhm yes
the weather is one of 'em
uh the food
um
and the way uh everything is centrally located
mhm
the traffic
the smog
and um
it's just gotten really really overcrowded
um i wouldn't say a lot but i do try to um
travel um
at least
once once or twice every two years
um
just exploring different things and being able to um
have different experiences um
things of that nature and you know
learning new things and um
just different cultures uh i like to um learn about different cultures and when you travel
um you get a sense of
um
you know feedback from different cultures and different areas so i like that
um well i just came from miami uh last year i went to miami for a week and a half
and it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going
um and um the weather was wonderful the people are really nice
and um it was really a great experience i went out there for um
a particular event um they have um something every year um where everyone comes out from all over
and uh you just kinda party and hang out and meet new people it was really fun
um
well from that trip i would say um
swimming in the beautiful
beautiful
beautiful
um miami beach waters was wonderful
yeah it was
um child development
mhm
well um
i've always been interested in children um since i was younger
um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age
and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do
um so
uh that's when i um looked into child development courses
and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy <en> enjoy doing so
um i started taking classes and um the rest is history
i am yes it's been um
fifteen years in august
yeah
my dream job
i would say um
to become a principal
well it's something that um i've thought about doing for a while now and um
i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going
so um i'm gonna be back in school and i'm gonna be taking courses
um so that i can make that happen
because it is a dream of mine yeah thank you
um it's gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me
and um you know it's definitely gonna be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine
so it's something that i'm willing to
i'm willing to do
um
a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um
and and outgoing as well um
but i think a little bit of both i would say
<laughter>
uh i meditate
i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating
i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time
oh wow i'm very very good at that
very good at controlling my temper i um
again um
a series of
meditation that i do um
it involves deep breathing and um
just really centering yourself
to where you can feel your heart beat and you can
um really feel everything in your body
and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger
and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot
oh wow
it was just recently um actually unfortunately
it was last week and it was with my husband
and um
it was about um
just the way he responds sometimes to me
uh it can be a little aggressive
um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression
i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so
yeah that was it
i felt
very frustrated
um and i actually felt angered too um
but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so
it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time
uh <sigh>
a situation which i wish i would've handled differently
honestly i haven't had a situation like that in
in years i've pretty much kind of
um
you know kind of mastered
my responses um
to certain um
stimuli
i've kinda got that down
the hardest decision i've ever had to make
well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage
um mother
i was pregnant at sixteen and
um i had um
a lot of pressure from family to um
give my child up for adoption or to
um abort
and i chose life so that was
that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old
teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager
or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so
that i think was the hardest decision
i had to make
um
well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later
and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by
not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life
pro-choice pro-life and um
eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and
i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom
i do yeah
um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties
um just as anything
um
but at the end of the day it is really rewarding
um
and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised
become a productive citizen and go out into society and
just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is
oh wow
so many ways um
the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um
accept his feedback even if i don't like it
and i um allow him to express his self
fortunately unfortunately when i was little um
there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child
um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it
um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self
i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age
and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um
make sure that you nurture that um because that's
kind of um
the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so
i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite
thank you
um <sigh>
well
it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up
so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that
it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away
and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so
it varies
i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um
i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but
other than that i i've been feeling really good
no i haven't
no i have not
you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up
i'm happy because
that is a chance for me to
take advantage carpe diem seize the day
so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because
i realize that some people did not wake up
some people are homeless some people
are going through so many situations that are really disheartening
and that's not me so
i feel really really blessed
every day
thank you
um as um
nurturing patient loving
friendly
um
kind of reserved
um
well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree
and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable
in certain subjects
and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things
and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert
you know what no regrets no regrets um
you live and learn um nothing is perfect
um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today
so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today
oh <sigh> man to stay in school to stay in school and to
get your education and put that first and foremost before a relationship
even before your career um i really really uh would would've told myself um
to stay focused and to
get a great education
i'm most proud of um
where i've come from um
as a teenage mother
um being a statistic and actually changing that
being on my same i've had my uh same job for fifteen years now i'm really proud of that
i've been married for thirteen years i'm really proud of that happily married
um to my best friend and my soulmate nothing's perfect but
um he's my best friend and i love him and i'm also proud of
my son um being the mother that i am and the son that i've raised
i'm proud of the job that i've done and i'm um
i really um applaud myself for that
you're welcome you were wonderful thank you
buh bye
