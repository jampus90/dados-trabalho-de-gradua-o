xxx excuse me can you repeat that
wow positive <posi> my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man
honest uh funny um handsome
um i have a business owner a business man that i worked for who was a extremely positive influence at least in my professional life
um i've had uh
a counselor at u_c_l_a who was um totally i think of her
often
and some of the little things that she'd said to me
keep me going um <sigh> in my life now
trust the process
she told me to trust the process
and when people are having trouble and i'm having trouble i take a step back and say
you know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it's supposed to be
mhm and there's one more
positive influence that i knew in hawaii
that taught me um
a friend of mine that uh lives on kauai that taught me uh
how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and
and i i love her a lot a great positive influence
healthy healthy influence
it's not
i have back problems
so it's hard to sleep at night
uh and i wake up in the middle of the night sort of
uh stretching and
um straightening out my back i have a back issue that sometimes more often than not uh
keeps me from sleeping good
that's okay i'm dealing with it
um i'm a little depressed uh i've been a little depressed i haven't been working as much and um
i um you know i have pain in the mornings and in the evening <eveni> i have pain thorughout the day in my from my with back
and it uh is a little depressing you know i get depressed also um
you know just thinking about
my business that i sold and
you know where i would've been if i hadn't have done that and
a a general feeling of um
i've been a little depressed over the past uh couple of years actually
yes
um well i've been diagnosed many many years ago and i guess depression stays with you although it gets treated
um
and uh i was diagnosed about two years ago
uh i think i don't know it asked me that on the questionnaire as well
and uh and i sought treatment
for it and then uh my insurance ran out
and the prescriptions
uh i couldn't put uh do my prescriptions anymore but now i'm back on uh medication <med> medication and
you know so i take medication for my depression
therapy absolutely
i love therapy
wow that's huge um confidence in self uh
confidence in myself um confidence in my decision-making
a general feeling of
overall content uh
a sounding board
you know when i have stuff that's bothering me that i can't
go to the i i feel that i can't go to the person with
i um
can go to my therapist and
a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or i worked through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation
and in that way i find therapy to be
invaluable actually
i believe so
uh yes i was
i believe it was
i think it was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what i was that's what i was having
and this was within the last
five years i think it was
looking back now
what are we two thousand thirteen it was two thousand nine
so four years ago
not able to deal like shell shocked not able to deal with anything eh irritable on the phone uh i mean just
uh just
anything would get me to fly off the handle and um just uh not able just shell shocked and
not and hiding at my in my house not opening mail <m> mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with
with things that were that i felt were well that were bombarding me i felt overcomed <o> overcomed
and um
the psychiatrist said that it was post-traumatic stress disorder but
um and i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so
uh or so and i don't know through
psychiatry and therapist and medication
um i was able to come out of my shell a little bit
hmm
about a week ago i was on a hike
eh up in malibu and uh at this beautiful labyrinth
that looked over the pacific ocean and we i was with a friend and we were having lunch
and i laid down on the grass
and took a nap
and i felt content i was happy at that moment at that
moment
that time about a week ago
hmm
honest sincere
smart
um
caring
um
<sniffle>
smart
um <sigh>
good question
i'd have to think about that
uh yeah i have regrets in life you know everything works out
so um
you know if i could change the past i would've never dropped out of school
when i did a long time ago i mean i've since gone back and completed lots of stuff
um i probably would've gone into the military
i think i was going to do that in my early twenties
i'm fifty five now
um i sort of regret not doing that
um at that time
um i regret uh
selling my business
i regret
and of course i can't control this but i regret that my father died when i was so young and
he never really got to know me and i never really got to know him
i regret uh
i regret not seeing
my grandmother enough before she'd passed away
i regret uh
i mean those are the things that i can think of right now not putting away for retirement i regret when i had the money to do it
um
yeah
i mean
just here that's what i would say
stick with it
just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through
and
i it when it comes to fear or flight i get the fear and i flight
so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then
everything works out
wow
i'm most proud that i <sigh> have remained
genuine
um i'm most proud of
being who i am
and being basically comfortable with that and i'm proud of that i haven't changed
to the world <wor> to the world you know for the world i haven't changed i've stayed
mm who i am
thank you
thank you
bye
