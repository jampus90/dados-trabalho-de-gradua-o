value
<synch>
yes
i'm doing good
uh los angeles
mhm
convenience
convenience
uh
people the crowd
uh traffic
people not respecting <re> uh eh lack of respect
uh huh
<laughter>
uh locally regionally
meeting old people <laughter> i love talking to old people
um
well i work a lot with uh my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in california
and i spend a lot of time with uh with the elders and i talk with them and they help me out a lot
so i get to hear good stories
mhm
mm
uh going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls that no one else had seen except for my people
yeah that was the most beautiful thing i think i found
mm
mhm <laughter>
um it depends on the situation if i'm um if somebody comes to me
looking for me to help them i take control
but if i need help it's eh i i work at asking for help so
it depends on the situation
mhm
i garden
and i paint
mm i'm very good at it
uh three days ago it was about communication it was uh the lack of communication on the other person's part
and
i needed them to communicate better so that way i could understand
uh they didn't communicate so we had an argument
and uh got it settled <laughter>
i felt um caught off guard
because this is a individual that i spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise
you know i was kept out i didn't like that
uh
mm i'd rather pass <laughter>
mm
uh
um probably the lack of time spent with my grandparents
growing up
it's just when they're gone you regret that you didn't miss time with spent time with them
so
mm
uh one thing i truly wish i could remember i i was a
i was a professional athlete at one time and
i had partied 'til like four in the morning and then i had did my event at like ten o'clock in the morning
and uh
i was my xxx captain and i embarrassed my whole team
and uh
that's one thing i truly regret
i was a professional fighter so
yeah <sigh> like not party thought about other people besides myself
mhm
uh
i studied uh massage therapy and got my nursing degree
um
and a lot of it's just been on job education
um very close
uh
uh due to my own injuries um
i had just gone through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked
and i decided to do that i wanted to help people too
yeah
oh yeah yeah
yes
i wanna paint
that's all i wanna do is just paint <laughter>
um
i have two sons and it's time for me to uh
to move on and they're older
and they can take care of themselves now
so me leaving the area where my sons are
it's pretty hard
yeah
oh
the reflection of you <laughter> the reflection of you
reminds you so much about yourself
who you are
consistency
even when you're sick <laughter> being consistent
i don't assume my kids are right or wrong
i listen to 'em first
and i make my decisions after that
and i try not to come from an emotional
heightened place
i think logically and i put myself in their place
before i do it we discuss we communicate heavy in my family
uh 'cause that's the only way we get along with each other is through communication
so communicate
um my family is severed pretty much so my family and my relationship with my family
on the reservation is very tight
um the rest of the family we're all fragmented and scattered around the southwest so it's not very tight at all
uh
i have too many to count um
start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad raised me a good way
uh xxx
uh he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age
um
he also taught me to protect my family
and taught me honor
taught me love
he's a good man
mm i don't i haven't had a good night's sleep in years so i i have get broken sleep
uh dreams the dreams become too real
i get up and go to the bathroom <laughter> and go back to sleep <laughter> i try to <laughter>
um <sigh> um
my years of fighting it just uh it caught up to me
xxx
uh reserved
yeah
reserved and i try to find things to distract my brain i think of different ways of doing things
uh
mm
well i got rid of t_v about eight months ago so i got rid of that distraction so what i do now is
i either paint
i garden
or cleaning house washing dishes
you know or get out and go walk that's another thing too do a lot of walking nowadays
uh anxiety <anxi> anxious <sigh> uh um a lot of anxieties
uh but it's good i have techniques to bring myself down now
um
nothing new
out of the normal
yes
uh three years ago <sigh> around there three <sigh>
insomnia issues
um it was about
two years ago around there
two little bit over two years ago i was released from therapy
oh the therapist released me
um
well i had i noticed is i still deal with pictures and emotions
but what i do is now i've i really practice hard at taking care of myself and and getting to those places the things that
strike me that get get me anxious or excited or angry
i've learned how to
work out of it and realize it's not real
it's not real
it's just the emotion it's not real
so these are the things like little mantras that i tell myself
and this has really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real
and yeah so therapy has helped a lot i mean it's just it's changed my world
yes
around the same time as the p_t_s_d
uh three years ago
um <sigh> in my dreams when i dream i do
last night
i was just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight and that was another thing too i build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight
and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then i always end up fighting in my dreams
so it's always mm what gets me scared in all my dreams is that i should've made the move and finished the fight and i didn't
and so it builds anxiety and stress in me and then i tend to act out in my sleep
yeah
like it was real like i was there
like like i smell taste feel everything there i was there
yeah
uh this morning
<laughter> driving here
talking to my girlfriend
this mm
trustworthy
he loves me i love him
he's we're best friends
i have zero to change
mm
i can't recall
regret
uh
just not spending time with my grandparents and and
i think day to day issues maybe you know a couple here there that i should've went to the store first or something like that but i mean
yeah it's nothing like that xxx
quit thinking you know it all
yeah
my loyalty
my trustworthiness
mm start a new art project yesterday
it was nice
mm
well i i
we were in santa barbara and we found some rocks and yeah some old rocks that someone had made a pile of and just threw a dump of old rocks out of the way and i went through the pile of rocks and
i found this old rock that was in the middle of it
and i took it home and now i'm doing a art piece on it and for me it was like this thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock
and now potentially it'll be sitting on my grandkid's table you know it's just to me that's really cool i like that
mm
start starting something
that
i'm so bad at
that i don't think there's no way i can be good at it and all the sudden i get
to be better at it to where i don't even have to think about it just so good at it that way i could just touch it and feel it and i don't think about it
i these are the things that i'm proud of like
i like that i like that
accomplishment i guess you can say
mm
bye <laughter>
