value
<synch>
i'm cool
fine
new york
yep
eh about six months
six months ago
nicer pace
uh photography job
it's a good move
mm
uh i love the weather
cool people
relax easy to talk to
uh
nice environment
mm
crime when you go through some sections
yeah
i've done my share
uh the ability to <sigh>
capture events
be a part of it be a part of exciting things like
um
olympics games festivals uh
special shows
yeah
meet new people
yeah
which one
mm canada
uh it was nice
uh very refreshing mm clean environment
uh the people seemed very very lighthearted
but you're able to do serious work
i love the landscape
uh i think it was riding onboard an amtrak train
yeah
uh liberated
photography
uh i think i'm doing it you know
i really <re>
i i really believe i'm doing it
um not very difficult you know uh um not at least not for me because i think i have some natural inclination for it
uh and um i connect well with people
i'm more shy but i'm forced to be outgoing because i you know you can't really get anything done being shy
but given a choice i'd rather be
um you know
a little more pulled back <laughter>
uh until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go
so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think
an example hmm
well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect
okay
well example like uh traveling
sometimes you wanna go to a particular place
and it's uh
something great happening there
even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot
um
now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there <laughter> you know to do you know uh um
xxx you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink
um
is that a good getaway spot still right now
something like that you know
mhm
mm
uh me i huh
i take walks
i call up a friend we have tea or something you know
uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control
mm eh
uh
it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much haven't fought again
i don't really dwell on
negative things too much
uh
um i don't have any regrets right now mm
i really can't think of anything right off the top
the hardest decision i've ever had to make
was uh
not hiring a good friend
uh for a job that
you know they weren't qualified for
that's hard
uh because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring it's their competence
my father
uh he just uh
taught me how to
you know uh overcome
uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up
uh
and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough
and i i found that to be true so
mhm
um
it's okay except <exce> except for some of my uh
my
distant siblings you know i don't see as often as i can
mm yeah
uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people 'cause <laughter> they're not always there you know
uh it's nothing like mhm yeah
mhm
uh
well you know i'm i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something or developing something so
i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that
you know when i when i'm out i'm out that's it
well uh
i guess i'll be a little bit uh
uh try and figure out how i'm gonna get sleep
you know as soon as i can to make up xxx but um
uh i i try not to be uh grumpy or anything i just probably feel a little bit tired mm
i feel okay now
uh
changes like what
mm
well i i i see a more hopeful future you know and i see uh
i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes
no
never
uh i feel okay now
uh i went to a great party last week
that was really cool
yeah
well it was like on a rooftop uh
and a a lot to really uh
nice people
who are basically in the same kind of uh
mindset
uh pursuing the same type of uh uh goals
and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information
and a lot of good connections were made
mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome
my ideal weekend
is uh
cooking my own food relaxing
you know and
if i'm in the mood for company you know
i have friends and uh
you know uh family members join me
well
i'd kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work
i eat like crazy and nothing happen
mm
well you know i i think people in general sometime uh
uh misread <mis> misread you you know if you kinda like uh
if you look different or you're in <i> in a different type of a
if a different set of things
make you uh excited or you're into a different way of thinking
um people tend to misjudge you
you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime
but um yeah i'm i've kinda figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me
you know that's hey
maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me i've kinda worked those things out in time you know
yeah
uh my best qualities probably um
uh listening i think
<mumbling>
and uh
maybe just uh talking
uh you know on a conversational level
uh
yeah
sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that
but uh you know
i guess is that's probably one of the things that come with the turf so
when i <clears throat> when i see too much of that i just uh pull back
uh uh
go for your dream
believe in what you're doing
don't let anyone discourage you
and you'll be okay
and that's the way i feel now that it's uh kind of evolved itself
most proud of um
i think my um
my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about
not being too too anxious about
about <bout> things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen
and you shouldn't really uh
never allow yourself to be defeated i'm i'm proud to be able to have
arrived at that point
in my
my my thinking my framework
uh that i think that saved me a lot of uh problems that could've been uh differently
<mumbles>
very good questions
uh i
bye bye
