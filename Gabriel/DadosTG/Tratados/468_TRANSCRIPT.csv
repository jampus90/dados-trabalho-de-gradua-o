value
<synch>
yes i'm okay with this
i'm pretty good feeling a little tired but uh
feeling pretty good for the most part
um redondo beach
yep
i like the beach i like the mountains i
love how you could go surfing in the morning go snowboarding in the day
um
i like to go hiking up in these mountains santa monica mountains to be exact
i don't like the traffic
i don't like the congestion of people here
and i don't like
the price of <o> the cost of living in specific areas
uh i've been trying to actually um
last year was the summer of
really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend um
we're looking to go to costa rica and hopefully to south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip
down the south see some of the southern states
but uh i've been to canada i've been to mexico and ecuador and
been to various states here and there
trying to get out there
i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different <diffing>
different foods that are native to that local area
and
it's just part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know
this planet we call earth
um just recently we went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and uh
it was gorgeous we uh flew into seattle
and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and
headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy was it gorgeous just
very lush beautiful trees the uh
the climate was nice the ocean was right there it was people were great it was just a fun trip all around
yeah
<deep breath> <sigh> one of my most memorable <sigh> memorable experiences
was probably the uh
the trip we took to colorado last summer
and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver
and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people who were living there and um
just the day before we had to uh contacted them and telling 'em we're coming in the area
and they were just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport let us crash at their place for a couple days we
even let us use their car to explore the state and go to wyoming and
see the
the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and
it was just everything worked out very well just every day was there was something new and fun to do
yeah
i uh i studied business management
and uh economics right now
um i've always wanted to
own my own business and i figured management be a
a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to
see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um
and then economics is just to
just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and
start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics
yeah i'm really stoked it was
one of the best decisions probably of my my life
yeah
i consider myself more outgoing i'm
i'm pretty friendly i don't mind to open up to people and stuff
<sigh> i like to be outside like to go hiking
i like to go um working out at the gym but
i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just
just puts me at ease
from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there
i uh
it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay
angry and hold grudges just 'cause
there's no need to life's too short for all that
um
see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody
i have no idea
probably when my uh
my brother and my girlfriend got in a little
little argument
uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um
i wish i would've just handled it
right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and
told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution
but now it's just
awkward
yeah it does
the hardest decision i've ever had to make
man that's a toughy
i don't think i've had too many
tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um
maybe
not moving to colorado for my undergrad
two three years ago
was a little tough just 'cause i kinda think what if
but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that
was really that hard of a decision
i don't really feel guilty about anything
pretty good person i think and for the most part
i couldn't think of anything
something i could wish i could erase from my memory um
nothing really to be honest i
i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part
i know that's kinda
weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and
i'm happy
yeah
uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's
it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month
but uh when i see 'em it's
it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and
it's not that i don't mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh
it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult
mm
my girlfriend's family uh
they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction
just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about
really thinking long term
and uh just seeing them <th> them and
what their family does and
how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to
and they've been very successful they own their own uh
accounting practice and
seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life
yeah
it's pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and
wake up in the morning
i'm tired sometimes i'm
could sense that i'm a little drained and uh
maybe get a little groggy here and there
and that's it
feeling pretty good for the most part a little
stressed out just 'cause finals are uh next week
and uh i really really wanna do well and just you know close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks
and um
for the most part that's that's the only thing i'm really nervous about but for the most part i'm really excited i'm looking forward to
going to maui for a week after graduation i'm fired up i'm fired up to
see what the future holds where we gonna live <l> me and my girlfriend gonna live and
what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just i'm excited to be done with school for a little while
yeah
i have never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
i've never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>
the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday
and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through
the nursing program for five and
it's just
seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her
yeah
probably outgoing friendly
positive vibes all around
adventurous
loves sports
team player knows how to be a leader here and there
and uh
gets a little outspoken sometimes
no not really for the most part
no not really
just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just
maybe 'cause i'm just done with school and i'm over it that i just don't feel as motivated
but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined
right now and that's not
i'm not going that way right now so
mhm
no biggie
<sigh>
oh man i couldn't
can't really think of a time
i went caving two weeks ago
that was a lot of fun
uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a
for an r_t_m class it's like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh
sequoia and just
me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes
it was a lot of fun
that was
yeah
ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school
a little less on the social aspects
and uh
kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya
um <sigh>
sometimes not playing hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and um
and that's pretty much it now
i'm proud <sigh> that uh i'm really proud that i'm graduating getting my bachelor's and i'm
looking to get a full time job i work at a law firm now so i have something going for me  um
i'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person long term wise <w> long term thinking wise i'm a well-rounded person
and i really wanna explore the world so i'm kinda proud that i opened my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and
really have a open mind to people and rather than judging 'em you know it's liberty why not let 'em do what they want
and uh
i'm really proud to just be finally getting my bachelor's and hopefully going for my m_b_a in a couple years
for sure
bye
