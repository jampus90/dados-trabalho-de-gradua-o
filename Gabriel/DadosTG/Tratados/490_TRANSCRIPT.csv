no weather xxx variations comparative um
traffic
sunlight
a little bit
seeing different things
been to europe a couple of times
been around the country
<sigh> hmm
visiting yosemite and sequoia parks were fun
depends on the circumstance most of the time i can fake outgoing or try to be outgoing
try to relax and breathe through it and move on
depends on the context
probably yesterday and my children about them not doing what they were told to do
arguments with my wife where i should've probably been more patient and understanding
hmm
um
sometimes when it's more of a hormonal period like this week i should just probably breathe through things and
recognize that she's going through things and i should just be more patient
um
what i was gonna do with my life
it was easy when i was nineteen i could just decide to do strange difficult things and
had the boldness to follow through with them
hebrew and semitic studies and classics
kind of
um i'm i'm in ministry and
that's working out the way i kinda want it to be
hmm
some embarrassing things when i was a teenager probably
it's pretty strong
i talk to my parents about once a day maybe
once every other day and
i'm constantly talking with my wife and children
xxx
i've got four of them they keep me very busy um they're between
nine and three
sometimes most of the time no
character development recognizing that
they need <n> need space to grow
when
when it works and you see character development and growth and
and exploration
i have more standards willingness to enforce standards
mm <sigh> mm
my wife
um
she's been there for me for fifteen years now and
helped give me the self-confidence to be who i am
better now that i'm not drinking as much pop at night
irritable
shorter temper
mm
pretty good pretty good i'm doing
been making some better uh decisions with my uh diet it's doing better
<sigh>
mm
feel a little bit more empowered not as defeatist as i was in a process where i wasn't eating very well wasn't exercising
wasn't able to get doing those things i've been doing a little better at that recently past few weeks and that's been a little bit more encouraging
no
nope
really happy um
probably a few weeks ago at the beach when everybody was having a good time
hmm
confident
loud
intelligent
i guess
hmm more patient
more um
more able to
automatically engage with people as opposed to being hesitant at first
oh
middle school when i was always the
low man on the totem pole socially
<sniffle>
being the constant butt of jokes
don't fall in the trap of thinking that middle and high school is life
<laughter>
um some time you know with children and family doing <d> doing some fun activity beach or museum or something
some time with the wife some time just by myself to read and kinda refocus
hmm
mm participate in some high level academic discussions
hmm
that i've been able to
maintain the standard and quality of life for myself and my family that i've been able to do so far
