value
<synch>
yes
i'm fine thank you
detroit michigan
yes
i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here
many more years ago more like forty years ago
uh i don't go back to detroit anymore
i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here
in california and
uh completely different um
for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't
the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space
a warmer climate warmer people
just a different
different uh vibe
that i that i like better
after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier
to start over here than some of the other places i had lived
or to stay where we were at
extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it
plus i had also
taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here
and went to school out here so i was completely used to it
well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh
less crowded it's more open space it's a
a calmer friendlier vibe
less rushed
the smog would be one
and when i drive the traffic
in certain areas it can be but
um
in general
there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's
isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens
the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like
i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all
so
i don't travel as much as i used to
but i have traveled worldwide
new experiences
well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled
through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so
i've traveled a lot of different places and
um i'll have to say they were
all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn
enjoy experience
uh my experiences i would say in um
europe visiting moreso i've also visited
uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different
i would probably say more shy um in general
um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing
although
i've had them describe me as outgoing
i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike
listen to music you know
i'm very good at controlling my temper
oh
probably when i was
married with my husband many years ago
it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him
it could be it could be a choice of
uh
some of the instances when i might've been with him and i
you know got emotional or
let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than
um
just you know seen it as
not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so
you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate
but some people
you know don't respond to the so-called norm
if you ignore it
mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case
i taught middle school kids and you can try calm
um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain
you know your professional demeanor so you can't really
um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so
well that could be
several
mm
um i guess a decision in um
along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery
uh
that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way
and in that case she died so
you know
uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious
outcome for them as well
mhm
<sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing
things that you might could do but
they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to
erase them you know if
you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a
strong reaction and they don't really look past the
uh impact of the event
'cause there might be something that
you can gain from that
but there are i i grew up in a home of
dysfunction so there was
just domestic abuse you know and um
there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things
but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things
that occur in life as an adult that
sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that
have not had really strong experiences
fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so
um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can
walk them through
levels of
understanding and you know
as you know someone
you have a balance of background information on
which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will
progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like
the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be
and you can also relate other experiences to them
of things that were worse or
you know seem to be
and of course there's always in general i mean
when you look at all the calamities in the world
you know most of those things aren't affecting
us or the people that we know here
so that provides
us perspective that
you know can pull someone out of their
i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly
intensity of their experience right at the moment
well we have a a good relationship they
eh for the most part there are different levels of
um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has
made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others
some have not had um
as much
experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way
so it's always evolving
and i
walk in positivity as a a lead of
you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender
a more positive
response from them
rather than feed
sometimes the
um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have
pardon
i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat
hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends
well my mother has always been a very calm
um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of
negativity i've had teachers that have um been
very um
positive <po> positive and proactive
and have you know taught independent thinking and
techniques to rise above some of the things that
were occurring
and just various friends that you know i would see handling
situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so
it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good
um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or
you know um
trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but
um
in general i don't have a problem sleeping
it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done
i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so
um but in general good
like
i mean
not in particular
i mean i just seems
um
less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do
in a shorter period of time but
you know reorganizing
some of the
things that need to be done
you know can smoothe that out
no i haven't but i know it's something that
a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have
i have not no
well there's several i guess um
and happiness comes in
small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning
is great
wonderful
you know day of happiness um
as far as big
celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum
you know
in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be
you know a moment shared with someone you know so
it should be an even on an even keel
um
as uh uh
perseverant
um you know i will
continue forth and
and um
positive
upbeat
um
maybe not doing
things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or
or spending my
time you know a little more differently but
that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see
you know you could've done some things differently
instead of buying
the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that
i would have um
made myself move to california sooner and i'm
i would have um
instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss>
would have you know the situation i have now
waited to get something different but you know how can you
you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time
with the best information <in> information available
you know after you have looked at several options
of um
being
independent and educated able to
uh take care of myself
okay
bye bye now
