um my family is not there anymore

wooded areas that's where i played in the woods when i was a a kid we'd swim in the quarries
um i rode my bicycle everywhere
and here it's a little um
more uh
cement and traffic
um
it was <wa> it just seemed
like cement at first but i love it now and i have friends and i i love
being able to do so many different things
um and i go to the beach a lot
um
i still go up to the mountains i go camping all the time
um so i i love it i love it
always opportunities
<laughter>
um i have traveled quite a bit i was in the peace corps
and i was um <tisk> in south america
i was in paraguay for three years and i traveled all through south america
brazil peru uh peru chile bolivia
um i also spent a year in london
traveled all through europe
and i used to go to canada often
uh i'd love to get to asia one of these days
uh meeting new people the food i love trying new food
um and just getting a different perspective
on the world
and different people's um outlook on the world
and because america tends to become isolated
um i hiked the inca trail
when i was in um
uh peru
and that was a five day hike
starting out of cusco
um we hiked for um i think what four or five days
um and woke up
one the last morning
at the sun gate of machu picchu
and that was just an most amazing experience 'cause i would only i'd i'd seen about i'd seen it in national geographic
you know all my life
um so to be there
and experience that was phenomenal
philosophy
i have my degree in philosophy
i minored in art
<clears throat>
well i started out in business
and i got very disenchanted with it very quickly
and so i decided to study what i wanted to study
while i was in college
and had the opportunity
so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher
um but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school
and being a professor of ethics
um but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i
ended up joining the peace corps <laughter> so it all worked out
i'm sorry
yeah mhm
i'm i'm sorry my alarm's going off on my phone it'll die in a second
okay i'm sorry
it's still going
sorry i turned off the phone but i forgot to turn off the alarm
that should go
okay what i'm sorry what was your question
my dream job
um <sigh >
gosh
um writing
um
i've done a few um
uh scripts uh some screeenplays with a friend of mine
um but i don't really wanna do the hollywood thing
um <tisk> but writing and teaching
and traveling if i could do that overseas
so
outgoing
should i turn off my alarm <laughter> it keeps going <laughter> here oh i can't move okay i can't get to my purse
okay i'm sorry
yes i i turned off my phone but i didn't turn off the the alarm is like
<laughter> it's like i forgot it's my alarm to go to yoga class
i'm terribly sorry about that <laughter> okay <laughter>
<laughter>
sorry for the interruption
um i have a actual fish tank
um at my house and i i do the the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset um the i sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing
um i also try and meditate
um i try and and just sit down and be quiet
um and gather my thoughts
um i like to read
and um or sometimes i i walk or i'll take my dog for a walk
<sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts
every once in a while
um when things are getting too chaotic
at my house um
and i'm feeling very underappreciated
i will
have a
burst of anger
yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation
but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of
um recognizing that i'm upset about it
my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad
and then that escalates and
uh
sometimes i just end up walking out the door
or going to my room
hmm
i'm sorry
um i i usually after i have an outburst
and i isolate myself for a little bit
i can come back relaxed
and deal with the situation
in a
more
calm manner
um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to
stop and and get myself out of there
and and go take some deep breaths
um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling
why i'm being angry why why am i being
um
so tense
and then be able to verbalize that
um
well i i it happens a few times when i start getting
i've had a very tense day
um and things haven't gone right
um
i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner
and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework
or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh
uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then
and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out
just let me finish dinner
and nobody would
and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up
and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to
pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there
um so that that i i should have um
walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that
um
it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child
um i wasn't married
um <tisk> i had a very good friend
um
oh i was i was
thirty two at the time
so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion
but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this
um
and i had
um
i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to
um
but we'd only been dating like three months
and i was living with
a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with
um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well
um i didn't know if we could raise a child together
i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else
um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together
um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together
um
and uh so it was a lot of
um
huge decisions
that were gonna determine the rest of my life
um
and i
made the decision based on
more common sense and practicality
um
but i don't regret that decision
i think i made a good decision
to marry my husband and
raise our child <laughter>
um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen
he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering
he is getting his pilot's license
uh which i'm very proud of him for
um then my daughter is
fifteen
and she loves acting
uh she um she has a boyfriend
who um
uh they see just once a week at church basically
um and they text each other constantly
um she's a very very typical fifteen year old
and then i have a twelve year old
he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly
um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house
so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis
no
i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't
my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young
and um my mother kind of disconnected
when that happened
um so i didn't have a very warm or loving
relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was
um kind of on my own from a very young age
um
i mean she was at the house but
really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have
parenting skills
that you know most people are are raised with
um
i know what not to do
but sometimes it's very difficult and um
i i see my friends that have you know these
very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect
um and it's like i i'm just not that person
so i i
i try and be
i'm i i think i am a very good mother
but i'm not um
a typical mother
i think i'm more
um i'm more creative
a lot of times i and we do a lot of things
um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing
actually when we go camping it's more
i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home
i think i'm more tense when i'm at home
but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become
calmer and more patient
i think my patience is what
um i need to work on the most
i'm a been an insomniac all my life
i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and
um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise
and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day
i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired
to sleep well
um and that's sometimes that's hard to do
um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading
i'll read 'til midnight
um and then i'll try and go to sleep
um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again
and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep
yesterday i didn't feel so good i was
um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday
um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden
and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard
um so i had some more planting to do
and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it
um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good
so i feel more positive i feel more energy
so
no
no
um
i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that
hasn't really helped me sleep
but um
it was really good because i needed one for a really long time
and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane
um but it was
you know just like
i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's
it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing
and it was like finally
uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list
um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and
uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy
<laughter> i don't know um
i think she
believes that i'm
uh
uh
more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am
at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues
uh
she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice
um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me
um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by
uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic
um or empathetic and
uh i just i'm just there to listen
and i don't need to give her any advice so
i think a a good listener and
good advice giver
i procrastinate a lot
um i start projects and i don't finish them
uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and
um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get
almost finished
and then
i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest
um
sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them
which sounds a little strange but
um
i i'm working on that
i'm trying to get those done
oh gosh <laughter> um
not following through on the opportunities i had when
i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree
um
with on a grant and things of that sort um
but instead i got pregnant and got married
and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed
um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time
where i had to fight for a directorship
and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship
and so i really wish so i resigned
um
and i wish i had stuck with that
um
'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and
solid career
um
not
base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses
um the jobs were wonderful
um
but
my ego got in the way
and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the
the
egotistical
reactions that i had
to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well
um my children actually
um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal
um and
uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that
they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl
my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started
and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day
and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it
um so that's
that was
one of my prouder
experiences
okay
thank you
bye
