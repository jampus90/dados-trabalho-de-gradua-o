value
<synch>
yeah i'm okay with it
uh
i feel i feel pretty good
little <l> little nervous
because i've never done anything like this before
that's why
<laughter>
yeah
from ohio cincinnati
yeah
uh two months ago
two and a half months
uh was just looking for
just wanted to be in a new environment
oh yeah i'm ecstatic
very happy
uh it took a few weeks just to get adjusted
'cause i didn't know anyone <an>
the weather is probably the best thing
yeah and uh
i mean other than that
it's pretty much the same as everywhere else i've been
there's nothing i don't really <real> really like about l_a
it's just you know just the weather is the best part of it
yeah
uh i like to travel somewhat
uh i haven't traveled a lot in my life but over the past
uh year and a half i've done
done quite a bit of traveling
just seeing different places different people new people new faces
new places
uh <sigh>
let's see last well last summer i spent the uh summer in cleveland
<sniffle> doing uh urban farming
uh in the city
yeah and uh
i stayed at a hostel the first hostel in cleveland
scrubbed_entry
and
i was uh doing a program with the uh
scrubbed_entry
and it was basically
we would
go to different urban farms throughout the city and
volunteer
about <bout> twenty twenty five hours a week
so yeah
really a spur of the moment type of thing
um
wanted to try something different something i'd never done before
and farming is one of those things that you know most people
would never try
'cause of a you know 'cause of a certain stigma that comes along with it
uh
and you know
i just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that
yeah
what in the uh
uh mm
urban farming or in general
in urban farming uh
i don't know i guess uh
i don't know just just the overall experience just going
you know eating uh going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and
just seeing the difference in
you know how fresh natural food taste eh you know
as opposed to the food you buy in a grocery store
yeah
yeah it is really is
uh i was i took two semesters
of uh college and i was undecided
so i was just taking general classes
my dream job
huh
i guess my dream job would to be
<ss> anything that involves <invol> uh i don't have like a specific dream job but anything that involves nature
just being outside
uh i would like to uh
i wouldn't mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that
just as long as i you know
yeah
consider myself more shy
uh i don't i don't know why <laughter> it's just the way it is
uh huh
i read
um
listen to music
uh
i draw
watch movies stuff like that
yeah
i think i'm pretty good at it
i think <thi>
yeah
<deep breath> wow uh
yeah i can't remember the last time i had an argument with someone
i don't know
<sigh> <makes sounds with mouth>
again i don't know because
i don't
dwell on things that happened in the past
yeah
<laughter>
mm
maybe whether or not to come to california
i guess that was a hard decision
well
i don't know i've been thinking about it
you know moving to a new place for a long time
and <sigh> i guess
the hardest part of the decision was
thinking whether
whether or not i would be
secure or not
you know what i mean
um
just going to a new place where you don't know anyone
uh
it's kinda
uh you really don't know what's gonna happen
so
uh
there was a lot of uh
you know
fear in that
in that decision of
should i go to a place where i don't know anyone i don't i'm not familiar with the area
you know
only
only perception ever had <ha> that i have of this area is
you know what i've seen on in media media and t_v
so you know
eh yeah guess that was
hardest hardest decision <deci> decision that i can think of
yeah
eh guess so
uh nothing absolutely nothing
yeah
uh
nothing
i don't feel guilty about anything
uh relationship with my family uh
i'm not really close to my family
um i guess the person
i'm closest to is my mom but you know i don't you know i don't i never really talk to her much
uh
i don't really know my dad that well so
you know
<makes clicking sounds with mouth>
<whistling softly>
<whistling softly>
uh
i guess my grandmother
yeah she
yeah she's uh
she's very um
xxx how should i say it uh
she's very
she's a thinker
i put it like that like she's very insightful
so
um
yeah i look to her
for a lot of advice because
she's been through a lot through a lot in her life
and i feel like she you know she's been through a lot so she understands a lot
so eh you know
she's a very positive influence
very easy
uh
maybe unsure
i would say
because
right now i really don't know
what direction i wanna go in with my life
and there's been a lot of confusion with that
um
but
you know it's not
it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind it feels <feel> feels like
somehow
maybe i'm running out of time
and i know that's not like that's not xxx that's not a realistic thought because
i don't see how you could ever run out of time
but
yeah i guess yeah
just general
not knowing what i want
but i know like
how do i cope with that
how do i cope with that i uh
i don't know i just do a lot of thinking
a lot of soul searching
it's not hard i mean
i mean i'm
it's xxx
like i can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that
i feel like it's necessary
and
you know certain things in life you just
you're forced to face
so
it's harder to i think it's harder to avoid
those type of things
yeah
no
no
no
uh
xxx today
when i talked when i uh talked to my friend earlier
yeah
how would my best friend describe me
uh i guess he would say i'm quiet
uh
uh
guess he would describe as a nice guy
uh
guess insightful
mm
uh goofy
and
yeah
oh i don't really think like that
no
ten or twenty years ago
uh guess i would tell myself to
stick with what what stick with what i love
hmm
uh i did uh
acting workshop
in um
scrubbed_entry
yeah
i don't know it's always <al> always been an interest of mine
and i decided why not
you know just try it
see how you like it
what am i most proud of
like an event or a an accomplishment
i guess i pride myself on being independent
mm
yeah
bye
