value
<sync>
yeah that's perfectly fine
i'm feeling great uh it's an early morning i don't have school
i'm excited <laughter>
uh born and raised in los angeles california
mhm
uh the fact that you can surf snowboard and like
do two drastically different things in one day
uh coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in uh <tisk> i'd say the population of uh
lower socio economic backgrounds it it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks
uh not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but
pretty young
hmm <laughter>
uh mostly if i'm traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing it's remarkable
uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old
and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh
we left
um <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change
the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza
it was it was delicious <laughter>
yep <laughter>
scrubbed_entry
graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications
so i can go into the military as an officer
actually it's like what
i don't know it's like
you gotta have a plan
and that's the only thing that's just fallen into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me
hmm to be honest a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it's
however you can get paid to do nothing <laughter>
yeah
but uh
probably
i was just definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken
uh i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights
i'm pretty good um
i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year
and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do
decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets
uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's
i don't i don't know
probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature
um <sigh>
hm <sigh>
so many um
i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in the applications and i'm pretty sure i would've been admitted
so it sucks but
hey
that is an intriguing question <sigh> um
i've actually no clue
the death of my grandmother
sure
um
my grandmother died when i was eleven years old
she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me
she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well
and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family
and <sigh> the closest thing i've had to a mother
and it was it was tough but
um it's gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth
and uh i've grown quite a bit no more tears
uh i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now
but um my immediate family i'm pretty close with them
and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was five so it's been pretty cool
fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting you know then it's a problem
mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively <laughter>
uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work
uh sure um hm hm uh
i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets
and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail
that you couldn't be excused from not making <ma> making your court date so i had
three failure to appears in court which sucked
tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so
i don't know
it's it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but
there're so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didn't forsee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and
yeah
thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate
to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really
so i i just bottle it up like i do
everything
not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe
no
no
hm really happy oh
why is that such a difficult question uh
mm i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day
seems like
uh dunking
across the street at the clippers center there's a basketball court there
and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah
mm i have
four close friends that i've known for over uh eight years uh each
and i don't know studious hardworking
determined
mm i don't know
<laughter> yeah <laughter>
mm probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over is uh i don't know i'm pretty content with myself
hmm <sigh>
i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh
uh grade school
i was uh i wasn't the best of students but
i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad
and down
uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sterness i don't think i would've
getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so he's been pretty influential
uh
i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad
and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully
and then his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty
yeah it was it was um <tisk> it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock
that was thousands of pounds didn't work
but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license so it was fun yeah
about that day or in general
mm
other than like the u_c thing like where i didn't apply to the schools in time
i regret that
yeah
hm
i don't know i was i was ten years old ten years ago <laughter> uh i'd probably say to myself
uh <sigh>
i i have no clue
that's that's an interesting question
uh being the first from my immediate college <coll> uh immediate family as in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college
so yes it's it's pretty in
yeah
no problem
