value
<sync.
yes
i'm doing fine thank you
los angeles california
the variety of people
the multicultural food <laughter> and
going to movies
rude people
scary people
it's violent
yes
experiencing different things
seeing different cultures
well i was stationed in germany for three years it was a great experience
food was great
bavarian alps the snow
the people
i loved it
having a baby
well it was just the most memorable thing in my life something i'll never forget
great
one son
grown
handsome
father of two
no
it's actually very hard for me
not becoming angry
too quickly
being able to cultivate
a mind
love someone unconditionally
well i went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent i was very afraid for my child to go through that same trauma
tried to protect him from it
i think it's really hard 'cause you never really know people what they'll do
outgoing
because if i'm in a room with people i'm usually
the first one to start talking
as a matter of fact i have fish aquarium
that's what
keeps me calm
not very good
<laughter> seems like everyday i argue with somebody about something but yesterday
um a lady tried to cut line
in the grocery store and i politely told her i was in line and
she didn't wanna move
 yes it has
because sometimes if people don't want to move then i feel it's my place to move them
hurting people physically
uh if i feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me i can get very ugly
i don't like that about me
um
i was pulled over by the police and they had uh
someone with my name and they were very rude to me and
i really wasn't happy with the way they treated me
um
how to
stay calm when
someone has
crossed over into my boundary
my personal space
i can't let people get too close to me if they do i i lash out
i don't want anybody in my  area of
protection i guess
stay away from people
<laughter>
stay away from
it's hard you can't live in this world without other people
sometimes they just irritate the heck out of me
being assaulted in the military is something i wish i could forget
just that i felt
helpless alone ashamed and angry
that's about all i wanna go into
eighteen
yeah
very young
no
because i was assaulted and
and i have a fear of
people in uniform
like the policemen hurting me or um
other military veterans
hurting me when they
explode or go off or
have issues of
p_t_s_d
i can't remember
i worked for the federal government
well it just seemed like a normal progression um
federal government gives you ten points preference over other people for being in the military so
it seemed like a natural choice
a organization that had a book of rules and they followed them
the government one government to another
yes
well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're given um
you're told to handle it handle it
and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and
different people to talk to to get something done
administration of justice
no um i don't work anymore
oh yeah
almost two years
the feeling that i was
always gonna be hurt that someone was out to get me
i had nightmares panic attacks
anxiety attacks
outburts <out>
outburts of anger
i was always in emotional pain
and i always wanted to hit somebody
yes mostly disrespect but i feel it's disrespect of people getting too close to me or
i feel in fear of them for some reason
i can't remember the last time i had a good night's sleep
what
irritable angry moody pissed off
irrational
tired
sick of the world angry at the world
wanting to be left alone
sometimes i don't wanna go on
yes
oh yeah <laughter> oh yeah
well i i could recognize a trigger now when something is gonna trigger me i can at least
know
and uh
act  accordingly if i want to <laughter>
when i saw my grandchildren when they came to visit
<sniff>
they're just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around they
make me forget about all the pain in life
<sniff>
<sniff>
planting seeds for some vegetables making a garden
<sniff>
i read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt
so i decided to find out <sniff> plant something and watch it grow
<sniff>
sitting on the beach looking <look> facing the water
thinking talking to god
wishing i were somewhere else
like hawaii
penthouse over maui
that i could trust people
that i wouldn't lash out at them
that i could sleep at night
<sniff>
crazy
hot headed <sniff>
emotional
being in the wrong place at the wrong time
don't trust anyone
be careful be wary of people and what they want from you
my son
my grandchildren
<sniff>
