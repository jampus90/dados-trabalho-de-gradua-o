value
<synch>
yes
i'm not bad i'm a little tired but okay
uh from saint louis missouri
yep
uh two months ago
uh not often i think i'm out here for good now
uh smaller town less people everyone kinda acts different the pace of life is slower out there
uh looking for work as a game designer or game developer just
try something new too new place new people
uh i guess i'm still getting used to it
um
i guess
people are different you know there's little shops everywhere just
everything's different
uh man the weather's great out here
the people are really nice
like to look at the mountains the beach is nice
just
better geography
um traffic i guess the commute
and sometimes there's maybe too many people
<laughter>
not really never been outside of the u_s before
uh just never had the opportunity i'd love to go though
uh game design and graphic design sort of
oh i love it
uh
mm been playing video games since i was a kid like most guys my age so
just like making people happy and it's kinda easy to do that with games
<laughter>
uh work for myself make my own games and write my own paychecks i guess
uh pretty hard i've been trying to do it for the past couple years it's a little difficult
i guess i'm kinda shy it depends on the people and the environment i guess
<laughter>
uh play guitar listen to some music talk to friends
i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not the type of guy that gets angry really easily
uh probably with my girlfriend over something silly i can't even remember
uh <sigh>
don't know i don't think i'm really guilty about anything i try to avoid being guilty
hmm
don't know
can't really think of anything
leaving saint louis was one of them 'cause all my friends and family were there
uh i guess the benefits outweighed
you know the cons
definitely
huh <sigh> maybe getting kicked out of high school the first time
uh just i ended up getting myself and and my friends in trouble and
it was just no good you kinda look back on it and
i guess that's something from my past i wish i would've done different
uh
followed the <laughter> rules i guess just been a good student would've helped
uh
not really that close with my family i've got a small family anyway and
when i was in saint louis we'd see each other a couple times a year but that's really it so no strong ties
uh i guess most of my friends they're always there to support me and encourage me and help me so
say pretty easy every once in awhile there's a night i can't sleep but it's pretty rare
mm just tired groggy
i guess my mind's unfocused and
day goes by heck of a lot longer
uh pretty good
not really much to say
uh maybe a little bit more depressed 'cause i'm away from most of my friends and family but
nothing unmanageable
uh just try to talk to 'em when i can think about something else think about happy times
no
no
uh <sigh> i guess on the drive out here
'cause it was such a new experience and so exhilarating
um i think graduating college 'cause i was really proud of myself and really looking forward to the future
just i guess kind of euphoria standing there it seemed kinda surreal <su> surreal
uh
funny caring nice guy
easy to get along with
uh <sigh>
pretty happy being me i guess
hmm
guess when i broke up with my last girlfriend for obvious reasons you tend to fight and say things you wish you'd you'd forget i guess
no i don't like to live in the past so there's nothing to really regret
uh <sigh>
keep working hard and just
keep thinking about what you do before you do it
on the computer playing video games with friends
uh
music uh
and my friends i guess <laughter>
mm
i guess my determination and my xxx my passion
for my creativity
bye
