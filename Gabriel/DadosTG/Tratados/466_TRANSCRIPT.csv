value
<synch>
<sigh>
yes
uh okay
<laughter>
los angeles
the weather
um
the variety of um environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety
<laughter>
um i don't like the superficiality of people
um the narcissistic attitude um
uh just
the um
uh it it doesn't have a small town sort of feel where
you know just the warmth the human sort of warmth interactively
so
yeah
no
um i have um a fear of flying and i have um i've developed agoraphobia
<laughter>
uh incredibly difficult
um yeah i'm i'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia um more so than the fear of flying um
it's uh it's more of a recent um development and um
it's um
eh it's progressing <pregr> progressing um to be worse uh it's very um
uh what's the word um
immobilizing and and very um distressing actually
mhm <laughter> yes it is
how to i cope with that um
just uh
just trying to um uh
do the best i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in um small steps
um i read a lot i do um bibliotherapy reading um
and i try to inform myself um of the um
of the professional literature um so that i could um hopefully overcome it someday
mhm
um yes definitely
um
uh certain things trigger it like um enclosed spaces
um
being in a car traveling um
uh being away from home um being in someone else's car
uh things that are outside of my uh locus of control
um
uh xxx actually i i don't go to school right now
um my dream job is
to be a psychologist <laughter>
um i'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is um
uh
having lived um through some challenges like this um having lived through some traumas
um but i've always had an interest in it um since junior high of
um
uh
i'm very interested in people and um in human interaction and human connection and
um the betterment of of uh of those things um
bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges um
uh
so that's that's sort of um it in a nutshell
um
i think i'm someone who's
um i can be very outgoing um and sort of um a warm and friendly presence very um easily but i think on <o> on on the exterior um
but i think i'm shy and i challenge it to do that
i think at heart i'm shy
um but uh but i i challenge myself completely 'cause i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges
uh the last time i interacted with somebody was <laughter> today
if <i> if i think i'm understanding your question correctly
oh no no eh i think i'm misunderstanding your question but i i interacted with rachel um i just i'm um continuously interacting with people
take taking those risks
uh very good um
mm
very good <laughter>
um
when was the last time i argued with somebody
i actually can't remember it wasn't recent <laughter>
i have to think about that i don't know yet let me think um
uh i'm drawing a blank um i can only rememeber things um
from when i was like twenty one <laughter> right now
i can't think of anything contemporary right right now
my mind is
okay uh when i was younger
yes um i lost um
a relationship with my aunt
and my uncle and my cousins
um 'cause when i was twenty one i'm forty five
um
i um
uh
uh
had a a disagreement with my aunt and um i said something that was uh critical
of her and
um she threw me out of their home
and um
uh
let me back uh i apologized immediately
and they let me back into their lives
um and changed their minds um so
i regret that
um
i'm assuming you mean um how did i feel when they asked me to um never uh be in their lives again
and to leave um
uh shattered soul shattered heart shattered
well that that was my family that was um
the the good side of my family there's um uh
uh the majority of my family <fa> they were they were the the loving aspect of my family um the rest of my family is very cruel and um like very abusive
um i don't have any relationship with my family at all
like the
since i was um
uh twenty one since my aunt and uncle um
uh
disowned me i guess is the right word
estranged yeah
um
gosh um i'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second
um something i could um erase um
<laughter> i can't even get it to my memory
um
uh as an example um
uh
i was injured and i wish i could get uh that away from my memory
yeah um
i was injured in um the emergency room
scrubbed_entry
doing um i went in for food poisoning um i was ordered to go in um
by a doctor um i had collapsed and
i was ordered to go into the e_r for as i said food poisoning and i came out um injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a um
uh what do you call it um
uh intraveneous procedure um and now i have um
r_s_d reflex sympathetic dystrophy
and it the scene in the emergency room was um it was a an out of control scene there was a problem with the procedure
and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake
um
eh and it was extremely excruciating um it was a a crisis
and so um every time i think about
the injury and it was uh disfiguring i got disabled
um
for <f> i uh got disabled for it uh disabled permanently um from it i was also um
uh disabled from my employment for a quite amount of quite a given amount of time as well
and
and it i have residual um
physical trauma from it and disfigurement and um
severe disability <disabil> disability limited um
um
functionality uh with my right my
i'm right-handed uh with my right hand
and arm
thank you
i don't even know what that is
um
i
you know i i really
i apologize 'cause i can't really probably give you the
uh most suitable answer um
uh
i'm guessing it had something to do with um 
my cat um and her um
her xxx urgent uh
um
uh what do you call it
um hurt she was in intensive care veterinary care and i'm sure it had something to do with that
um
but other than that i would say um i had uh choosing my life path whether
scrubbed_entry
um and uh i was admitted um to that program
or whether i was gonna go um to um art school for four years um
and i had to pick a life direction but uh that's not a traumatic situation um
so i i don't know how best to answer your question
i can't
um i have um
severe nightmares <laughter> and i have um nocturnal um 
uh panic attacks
and i also have physical illness on top of it and i'm in excruciating pain
yes
yes
yes uh they're triggered by the injury that i told you
um they're triggered by my family
um
they've <th> how they've treated me what um they've said to me what they've done to me um
they're triggered by um
what else um my um my physical um illness um not my injury only but my physical
um illness as well um
so yes
um
i feel very ill
and
feel so fatigued
very ill and very fatigued
um
when i don't sleep and get enough sleep um uh my anxiety level i believe is up and
um i'm susceptible to feeling distressed
um
so yeah
yes
um three years ago um my <m> my most recent um diagnosis
and in two thousand and one as well
uh yes
um
three years ago and um
when i was um
twenty years old
um the my background my childhood um
from my family of origin um
and their um uh
uh you know the abuse that i um went through
uh and their ultimate um uh
uh what's the word um
rejection of me and uh estrangement um that was the first uh reason
um
no i stopped six months ago
<sigh> um
why did i stop um i'm just taking a break <laughter> i'm gonna continue
yes very much
it's helped tremendously
um
i think it helps with anxiety it helps with um
um
it helps inspire um create inspiration it helps um
um
uh feeling connected
um it helps to create um what i ultimately um my goal is to
um give myself a voice and um
um
uh it helps to to do <d> to uh
it <i> it's part of that process
um it also helps um to understand myself um to learn about myself
um
and eh there's just so many benefits it's
i
i'll stop right there there's many more
mhm
um
the last time i felt really happy
it was a was a really long time ago um it was before my illness
um and it was in nineteen ninety seven um the onset of my illness was in july of ninety seven so it was um before that <laughter>
yes um
i was um in a very good place um in terms of my career um
um in terms of um
uh my just my relationships and um everything was just sort of at it's best um
uh career relationships um
personal um uh fulfillment um sort of um
as well um i was very active and and doing
uh very many things that were meaningful to um build a life um and i was um in the process of um
uh just in the in <i> in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished
at at the same time so it was just things were just going very well and um i just really liked uh
the just where my life was at it was just in a really good place in many ways
mhm
um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety
um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia
my p_t_s_d um meaning my trauma um and um
uh
what else um
um
my insecurity uh as far as um
uh
just um
with <w> with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that um
that i don't do something that that um
hold on one second
i'm just trying to make sure that um i don't do anything that's um offensive to them or insults them
um
or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like i'm overly um cautious about that and um
it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself
um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial
uh to change um the other thing i'd like to change about myself is i wish i could feel
um and also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um
i wish i didn't feel um
uh so um
uh i didn't wish i didn't have the burden that i do of um
my family um of not having one
um
and uh what else um i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical
um excruciating pain that i'm in uh so those are some things um
and i also wish that um
and this is um a a by-product of p_t_s_d i wish that i didn't have um
uh
the the symptomology
of p_t_s_d um 'cause that definitely um
affects one's complete <com> complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely
um and i i wish i was more articulate
and i wish i was um someone who was well-spoken
and someone who is well-written
um but there's many there's many more um
uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself
so many more
<sigh> um
i'm not sure uh
<sniffle>
maybe to um not be so trusting um
i trusted um
i trusted some medical professionals that um
you know again created the injury
and um
you know were
there's a uh
what's the word
there's an expectation and a sort of a demand to just
blindly trust um the medical profession um and
<sniffle> um
don't ask questions and just sort of um
you know
and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition
um and so i would
i would've told myself to be a little more careful um
i guess if that's
useful to your question
<sniffle>
um what did i really enjoy um
you know i can't think of anything specific um
but um
i know it would have to do um
with either reading or um
connecting with someone on a meaningful level
<sniffle>
i'm most proud of um
my compassion
um
my um my uh empathy and caring about people
um
despite um i mean i'm proud of it
anyways but um also particularly <sniffle> um i come from a
um an environment that's the opposite um a background and um i wasn't taught that <sniffle> um but i really do care about people and um
i'm i guess i'm most proud of that i'm also proud of my um career
accomplishments
um and my um tenacity um my fierce <fie> my fierce tenacity to succeed
um <sniffle> and uh
you know just um also to get um the strength it takes to get through um
the injury
uh to live with it and to live with the illness um that i live with the physical illness
um
so i i think that would be it
<sniffle>
yes
okay
you're welcome
bye
