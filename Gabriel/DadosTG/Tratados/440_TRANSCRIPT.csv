value
<sync>
yes
i'm okay thank you
um i was born in east los angeles
and
yes
um the freedom to explore outdoors
and with different um
weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat>
temperature
and climates to go skiing or
to the beach maybe in the same day
i like that
um
mm i think probably the overcrowding
um and the smog
mm not not frequently but i have
meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures
sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy
and um
that was my second time being there
and
i enjoyed it more this time
because
um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um
and i was better prepared
for
italians and their culture i felt
i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought
for that trip
um <clears throat>
that would be
um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house
in the midst of
acres and acres and acres of grapes was just
magnificent
um human development
um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i
started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant
and um i went to a program
in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant
and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss
i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly
and um so the college offered
human development as a major
and i um
just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired
towards that particular major and
and i'm happy with it
um currently no i stay at home i have a little one
uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work
um
in the meantime i design jewelry
well i have three
children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children
seventeen and twenty three
no
um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional
all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time
for every age <laughter>
and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages
so
um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages
that's why it makes me crazy
um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents
it was just kinda like
you know is she fed is she dressed
she has a house i mean a roof over her head
and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so
it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of
that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age
every year month
you know <clears throat> and um
so i think it difference differs in that way
tremendously
very close
<clears throat>
outgoing
mm
i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited
i
feel a little
you know
confident to talk to people
i probably talk
more than i need to <laughter>
um <clears throat> i bead
i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax
i'm pretty good i i
well i think i um
try not to
not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are
when i'm upset
um which is not good
'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out
and um
yeah that
that's uh something i have to work on
like exercising or something
um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about
um
he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage
on him
uh really tired of talking about that same topic
um
well it came it spawned from <f> from
a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for
many things
and um <clears throat>
and so he took that information and came home
and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me
think about cheating and
he knows that i've been resentful of him
and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating
<clears throat> and um <sigh>
i we've had this conversation a lot of times
and uh i mean not just that but
i don't know just about cheating in general
and um so i just said what i
normally said normally say is that i haven't
um
cheated and that i
did think about that when we were first together
and uh but it was just a mere thought
and
um
and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another
and that just kinda
<sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that
and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again
and why are we having this conversation <laughter>
are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that
that
went into
that um
argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting
um <sigh>
not talking
at all <laughter>
um <sigh>
mm
pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled
because i really don't like
if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because
um i was yelled at
a lot
and i just
feel bad about that and i
try really hard to not
handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get
and result in in yelling
hmm
that would probably be whether to keep
a pregnancy or not
yeah
yeah i um
i was just talking about it yesterday actually
and um
oh i was pregnant and
i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married
and but i just
didn't think that i it was the right time for me
and um
i had
pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy
but i made the decision by myself
and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant
he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me
and so that decision was quite hard
because i felt obligated to do so
and felt super guilty to not
and
<drops microphone> oops
and uh
this is on correctly um
hang on this ear piece is falling
there we go
that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no
i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make
in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um
the hospital should um unplug the life
or um life support machine for my father
or not
that was the hardest decision
um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that
and to have been um
to resort to the situation that he was in
not capable of doing anything at all either speaking
for himself um
was beyond it
who he was and i just couldn't see him
like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told
so i agreed
to um resort that
not
hardly ever
<laughter>
too many things running on my mind um
and pretty much um
mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends
uh even though i
know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about
uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time
but um
and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out
but it's hard
very stressed
mm my son is is um
has been
uh in dealing with some legal issues
and um currently is incarcerated
and uh
it's been really hard
yes i've been probably very short
moody irritable
well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter>
my mind just goes from one
point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there
um you know
it's interesting
uh yeah
no
yes
about three years ago
um my
um o_b_g
suggested i
i uh
see a psychiatrist
yes
well um
i've
in the process of changing therapists so it's been about
because the program that i was in
um
lost funding
and i lost my therapist
or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been
about two months
maybe three now
and um but i did notice when i was in therapy
um that it was just an intricate part of my
my life my week to
see my therapist
um
it really helped me
cope
um
<sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um
when he was released
from um
jail
um
a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning
that i'll
i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to
do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know
legally of course
um
outgoing
um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her
um
and
compassionate
sensitive
loyal
mm
all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter>
well yelling the yelling part was one
um
just <j> just the little things that
used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself
doing them and it bothers me a lot
regarding what
mm
<clears throat>
um
not too much really i don't know
<clears throat>
to go to college right after high school
and not wait
um
and <sigh>
that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy
or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and
not in a relationship and still be happy and
live life
um
what did i do
mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good
yeah
i was happy that he was safe
um
my children
and uh
my accomplishments
in um
school and work
bye
