uh you have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see a lot of things to do
smog
uh the environmental has changed over the years uh xxx
i've been around since nineteen fifty two and
i was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog
and
mm basically that's about it
i've been to several <s> uh several places in the united states yes
uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical i'm a historical buff i
um
just uh going somewhere different than uh where i've been here all my life
uh let me start with uh
well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um
uh i saw um
um
eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um
there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um
god
i can't even think of it right now um
but other than that uh new orleans i've been to new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras it's just i don't like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of
people um i just went on a off season
uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia
and i have taken a cruise
uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise
uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental
um i'm outgoing
as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone
um i don't have a problem meeting people
um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>
oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that
loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid
i've won a lot of sweepstakes and
uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just
eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me
um
getting married and having my children <laughter>
mm
i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not
and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson
and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner
and the other one is a computer engineer
so and i've been married for thirty three years
and um
basically uh marriage pretty strong
you know what
if you build a foundation with your children
and have a good relationship with them
and talk to 'em and find out what's going on
and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you
and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you
you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door
that you care
and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out
um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem
as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble
and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law
uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you
and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son
and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home
on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey
i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads
so it pays off
and i i basically he treats her well
um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um
for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls
so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel
and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they
found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one
and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel
so i've made up for her
and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there
i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly
so i made up for it
i think before i speak
and then i am the type of person also to um
i take on other people's feelings before i um
blurt out the wrong thing i try to
uh analyze the situation first
before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of
um
<laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house
uh we had a disagreement on that um
men have their own way of doing things and um
i had told him not to use a certain uh
eh person to work on our house
but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead
and now he sees all the downfalls
and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so
but i guess he can tell by my facial expression
that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money
and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong
and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project
so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um
that i can think of that's recent
i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me
and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um
you need to do your research
i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's
but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money
and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed
he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>
which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money
and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
and it didn't make any sense
um
i retired early
um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california
um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen
and i had like thirty one and a half years of service
and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance
so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but
um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long
um
i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay
um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job
because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um
i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up
and i don't i pay very little money
so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive
um
let me see the hardest
it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying
and my mother um
died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma
and
i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying
or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me
and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx
and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order
and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things
you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and
i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff
and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting
she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had
a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything
yeah it was it was but
and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um
since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children
that my husband and i we got together
and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um
what do you call the um
barrel insurance we had that
and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything
and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird
so
my son
make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what
i went through
and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on
and um
he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust
i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call
and that's it
i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well
pretty good
um
i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental
um
exercise walk walking more so
no not really
no
no
i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh
uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them
uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um
thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing
oh uh resource person i've been um
described as a resource person from my supervisor
to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about
i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh
some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place
i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map
yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but
sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff
that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things
and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things
and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it
and that gives me satisfaction
uh
i wish i can uh um
stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and
and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem
and if i can stop binging and making food my friend
um
i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um
but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home
and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so
i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh
not happy with my weight that's it yeah
i'm sorry didn't hear you
um
no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on
um
let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago
mm
i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um
putting away more money before i retire
instead of retiring too early
most proudest is of my life
um
meeting a lot of people that came in my life
uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school
and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together
lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school
group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion
and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh
it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>
okay
you're welcome
bye bye
