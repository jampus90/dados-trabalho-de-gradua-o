value
<synch>
yes
fine
oh san fernando valley
uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around
it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system
uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel
um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class
yeah it was fun
hmm <sigh>
i think it's tough to say
um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley
and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night
philosophy
yes
um
hmm
i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked
all the different
ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy
huh
i don't know but i really like children and i really like
studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it
i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i
i think i'm pretty friendly
um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read
um
yeah
i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about
other things if i start getting mad or um
i just start trying to focus on my breathing
i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend
um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um
i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party
and he was getting frustrated
which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with
well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and
i
really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out
hmm
i think a lot of times when my
oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother
uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close
as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i
and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him
hmm
um
when i was nineteen
i came home
from a party
i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things
and then he didn't speak to me for about a year
uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home
um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could
um <sigh>
and i love my siblings i
again my little sister and i get along really well she's
four years younger than me
and when
when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and
i wasn't
in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore
and that's really great
and
we get along okay with my uh
my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve
scrubbed_entry
one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good
uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and
who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that
i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but
generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning
um
well i'm really tired i can get grumpy
but i think usually i'm just
groggy
pretty good i'm a little anxious about
um
about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about
it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time
um
yeah
<sigh> well
i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic
no
no
hmm
well i think the last time i felt really happy i
went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party
and um
i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people
and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun
um she would probably say that
i'm smart and uh
pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch
really like serious films and t_v
um
and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot
well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so
um so that's a major one that and procrastinating
hmm
um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh
uh given
eh
sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was
very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem
like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock
speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job
but it was
was not
great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation
well i would've been twelve
and two
um
but i think
i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think
i was a little selfish and self-involved back then
i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and
um
i do regret
a couple of
semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a
a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript
i think so i'm
i think i
i wasn't focusing in school at that time
and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that
hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then
going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges
and then maybe
going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping
and maybe watching a little bit of t_v
huh
well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up
i'm ten years older than him so
and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which
made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and
um and how close we are
