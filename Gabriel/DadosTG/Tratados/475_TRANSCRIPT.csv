uh i was first person in my family to graduate i guess from college so it's kind of a big deal
uh advertising communications and public relations
well i've
in junior college i did um communications um a lot of public speaking classes so
i i went on and transferred to a university and um
wanted to study the same thing i guess
yeah i work in advertising now
<deep breath>

a big golf company
and do their advertising for them
to
i'm definitely not shy maybe
um
seem might seem like it right now just 'cause i'm not this is a different
a new setting but usually outgoing
<deep breath> <sigh> um i run <r> i like to go to the gym i i think
uh i like to run and be outdoors i surf a lot
so any time i'm stressed i definitely just
try to go to the gym or
wake up earlier and surf before work
um i don't really have a temper i just
i'm pretty mellow
haven't really argued with anyone um we have uh disagreements you know with family members or friends but
it's usually uh solved right then and there
mm
i'm not sure
maybe not uh
providing for my family as much as i'd like to i guess
mm i'm not sure off the top of my head
it's pretty good we're all pretty close dad mom sisters brothers wife
in-laws siblings yeah yeah everyone pets
probably my dad
he's a he's a hard worker
and uh he's kind of trained me to
do the same thing be the same way
that's one thing i struggle with i definitely get a good night's sleep but it's hard to go to sleep
just over the years of um sleep deprived insomnia <insom>
a little bit of insomnia i mean it's getting better now that i'm getting older
i'm trained trained my body to go to bed around one but when i was younger it was two three four in the morning
i feel okay
happy
mm i mean a little bit right now just because uh
my wife <w> my wife is uh pregnant so i'm slowly <s> slowly feeling a little bit of the uh the side effects i guess
yeah like i mean i feel a little a little down here and there but at the same time i like i said i just go to the gym or go for a longer run
you know 'cause she's healthy we're healthy you know everything's good and all that but
supposedly uh you get the uh man pregnancy side effects it's our first so i'm unfamiliar with the feelings
this morning when i when i woke up

<sigh>
um i got to get together with um a couple of my friends and play a round of golf enjoy the sunshine nice day
as outgoing and
um hardworking and
a family <f> good family person
maybe just to
have a little bit more confidence

negative i guess uh
just try to move on
to go to school stay in school um
