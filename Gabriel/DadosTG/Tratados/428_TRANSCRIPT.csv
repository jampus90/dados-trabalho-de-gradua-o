value
<synch>
<laughter>
yeah
i'm good how are you
i'm from here <he> um from los angeles
<clears throat> probably the downtown the view
and it's not that i like it but that's just where i for my parents were so that's where i grew up
nothing that's where i live i i love l_a <laughter> maybe that it's ghetto but that's about it <laughter>
<clears throat> i was thinking of going for sound engineer or mechanic
hmm but i'm not sure
<clears throat> 'cause <cau> 'cause my dad um he used to do that
mm i'm not even sure to be honest
haven't really thought about it
i can't look at your shoes
uh no i don't travel like that
i don't know maybe money <m> money issue or something
if i had money yeah i'll go all all over the world just
<laughter> probably um
outgoing
depends i guess
i don't know
<laughter>
about what shy or
outgoing
<clears throat>
well outgoing you could be outgoing at a party you know like you're already out there so you can't be shy i guess if you're going to a party
good
probably um
my girlfriend and 'cause i missed work 'cause i just felt lazy
i was like whatever you know i just didn't wanna go and i
i do what i want <laughter> i just didn't go
nah not really
she's over it already
as long as we have the bills and rent paid <laughter>
don't worry
guilty
probably nothing
i guess i should've gone to work <laughter>
mm <clears throat>
damn that i could erase from that
probably bad friends that i've met you know
like friends that trick you you know that said that
that they just trick you friends that deceive you i guess
okay like um
my friend told me that he had a good job at some car wash place so he told me to to he's gonna
get me hired there and give me direct deposit but then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account
so
<laughter>
<clears throat>
probably moving out and into my mom's house
yeah i haven't really been around eh like a big decision like that
i wanted my own space you know my own life i wanna do what i want and come home when i want leave when i want
yeah <laughter> yeah <laughter>
uh we're all close we're all you know we hardly argue we're all always around we always see each other
my mom my dad my brother <laughter>
how they were a positive in my life
well they're always there for you you know whether you have financial problems they're there they help you out
whether you're sad they know you know and they'd be like hey what's wrong you know let's go out and eat somewhere just to cheer you up they're xxx they're your family and they're always there to motivate you and
keep you going
<sigh>
uh easy
actually yeah pretty easy
i'm sorry
um
i haven't noticed but maybe
probably the same you know i don't think sleep does affect you but
i don't know maybe
more tired but i don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that
good
everything's great
um
maybe that i wanna start <s> know like start a new business or something
<clears throat> well like my dad um
he wasn't around for a while but he just got back
and um he actually opened up a shop and he's getting a a a lot of customers
so i see that his business is growing so i'm probably gonna learn learn <lear> um learn mechanic like like i was saying earlier
at school
<clears throat>
i don't even know what it what is that
no
nope
<coughs>
<coughs> i'm sorry
um

<coughs>
that i'm funny
<laughter>
i uh
uh no
<coughs>
um
i don't think nothing everything's fine you know thank god everything's good right now
i don't think there's nothing to change like that
maybe a better job
well first of all i don't even have a job
so i guess to change i get a job
nah it's hard for someone to put me down like that
<clears throat>
xxx could say probably that i'm responsible as well
at home
resting and then i call some friends over they usually do come over
barbecue whatever comes to mind you know just there in my house 'cause i have a nice backyard 'cause i just moved to this new house
so so far each xxx yeah so each weekend right now we just
people come over family come over and we pretty pretty much just barbecue there just hang out
<clears throat>
my sister's birthday party
it was on saturday
and it was fun there was a lot of dancing you know people uh i saw
family that i haven't seen for a while
so i enjoyed doing that
so
<clears throat>
probably that i was like i was able to help my mom throughout
because she was going through a really hard time my mom and um
for almost nine years 'cause she was having hard trouble paying bills and rent
so i
i'm proud that i was able to help her even though i could only
give so little
but she at least we're all still good you know and we're still alive and everyone's still blessed and
um
being around my family music music always puts me in a good mood
any kinda music even if it's even if it's depressing music it's still gonna <go> it it's still gonna get me happy
yeah
<laughter>
