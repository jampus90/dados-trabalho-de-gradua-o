i forgot what it was called it was long ago
nah nah nah not anymore
this
being me and just <j> hanging out
i rap that's what i do
i do little shows around the country and stuff i got a little fan base
and i'm just always you know just doing that just doing art i draw too
my my dream job is not working a job and being me
that's the dream job getting paid for being me
so that's yeah
i'm pretty good
like two weeks ago i was at this after hours
one i was already like super drunk and two it was after hours
three it was after hours so like
man i had a bunch of pens
these dudes took my pens away <clears throat> pens in my like fanny pack i had like a fanny pack so i had pens in there 'cause i do art
he's like nah dog you can't take this in and i'm like
okay
for sure let me just leave 'em right here and i'll get 'em when i come out and he was like okay
i come out and they're gone
accidentally knock a beer over
and he gets mad at me he's like you gotta go now and i'm like that wasn't my fault that was your fault but then
but then while that happened
my homie was getting like ambushed by these three big old security guards
and then you know when i saw them put hands on my friend that's when i really lost it
and i and he and i was like better let go of my friend right now he's like what you gonna do ese <spanish> and i'm like what you gonna do and then like he threw me to the ground
then i and and no no he had his arm over me i put my arm over him and threw him to the ground and then it got broken up
but that was the last time
i got angry
it was cool it was fun
life
you know
huh i made <gibberish>
maybe that maybe that situation could've been handled differently
it could've been handled differently if they would've been handling things differently then i wouldn't have to react
it's not like i was mad i was acting off of reaction i had to react like that
because like justice like i couldn't it was unjust it was like
i'm not a mean person at all but when i saw
one of my loved ones get attacked i had to like come
and like you know like react to that
and they were the hot
you know what i mean i was like yo ya niggas is tripping like yo
chill out this is a tiny little white dude
you're a humongous ass mexican nigga it's like you need to fall back
you know what i mean it was crazy
<laughter>
guilty
uh i don't know i steal shit sometime from stores when i'm hungry
if i got no money
i guess i'm not really guilty 'cause i don't know actually yeah i don't feel guilty about that
food should be free
know what i mean
but um
yeah i don't know
i lie i guess i lie <l> everybody lies sometime i lie sometimes
maybe like little like idle here and there exaggerations
okay <ok>
nah nah never
the hardest
i guess
i don't really know what the hardest decision was but i get faced with hard decisions
and those would be like
i got so many friends sometimes
i can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend
so it's like i gotta make decisions like if i go over this sector of the town
i'm gonna hang out with x y z niggas if i go over here x y z niggas so it's like
heavy you know
those are hard decisions 'cause i never like to let anybody down
so uh yeah stuff like that deciding between friends to hang out with
ouch
it's cool i live with my mom
i come home like every three to four days
so i'm i
who
what could you repeat the question
um
my aunty
oh she's just really nice she's like a little sweet little blind old lady
who cooks really good
and it's tight i don't know
something i could erase from my memory
i wouldn't wanna erase anything from my memory
'cause that'll be like
because like
the experiences you go through make you who you're who you are
i think weak people like to wanna erase things or block things out like
i don't that doesn't exist i mean there's shit that's been hard
but i would never say i would not want that to happen
'cause you know you must you gotta learn from experience you know i mean to be the better you
all that shit is like a is like test you know
that bad experience is just a test you gotta overcome
and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my god life's hard oh
you know that shit's for weak people
i don't believe in that
i have compassion for people who do get a
who do wanna do stuff like that but i still like
i don't see the logic in it
mm
i mean i stay up pretty late and do all sorts of reckless ass shit so uh but when i am home
and it's pretty easy i could just go to sleep
you know when i get tired i get tired
yeah
lately i've been on this like i've been partying hella tough lately like oh my god for at least six days
like today coming to do this talk to you
was the first time i've been able to come back to culver city since like friday
'cause i've been downtown and then it was like cinco de mayo
and it was like you know random ass parties i went to with homies
smoking ridiculous amounts of cigarettes drinking beers
fucking did some molly
fucking did some coke
fucking shit was crazy yo it was just like uh
it was a rockstar weekend
or a week
or
type of stuff
that's post traumatic stress syndrome
no i have not
i have not
but i get
oh i mean shoot saturday i was hella happy
<laughter>
it was great
but i was under the influence so
but it was still great you know i was mad empathic
like
mad like a flirty
mm i was freestyling like a g i was like kicking hella rhymes <sniffle>
uh it was dope you know
analyzing my life realized some stuff that i'm gonna change about my life and uh yeah it was i had a ball it was great
it was awesome i <xxx>
oh yeah it was
no
i didn't even have a crazy comedown
i'm i'm like i'm chilling
i definitely gained a couple pounds from last week i've been drinking a lot of beers i'm feeling a little extraneous but besides that
i'm i'm
ready
hmm okay
i don't know as a lovable dude
people be loving me man they don't like me they love me
and that shit's crazy
i just you know i just try to be happy i try to make people happy and just you know <sniffle>
be real posi-core as they've said
like this is hella positive <p> positive you know
man i really don't wish i could i mean i'd lose weight i guess that's about it
but besides that i that's i mean i ride bikes every day like my legs are pretty strong
maybe i'd just get more buff in the arm
but that's about the only thing i would change and i don't really <r> i'm not really in a hurry to change that like if that happens just through me living and me biking more
then yeah cool but i don't not <n> i'm not you know abrupt change i don't need i mean gradual change sure
but i'm not i don't know yeah
i wouldn't change anything but if i would it would be that but really nothing 'cause i'm chilling right now
uh
i don't know i got broken up with like
in august that made me feel bad about myself i guess
and yeah it was just somebody i was going out with but they just broke up with me and like that shit sucked
but that was probably the last time like i felt really bad about myself <cough>
um what exactly do you wanna know about that
oh like um
i don't know we were just going out and then she was just hella jealous and was going through my phone sometimes and accusing me of shit but then she ended up breaking up with me
just 'cause she wanted to like mess around with other people
and that was the relationship in a nutshell
uh life sucks you gotta adapt and change man
know what i mean
don't walk from it run to what'd you say
yeah that bitch gave me s_t_ds that shit sucks fucking a
that's the only thing i regret
yeah man it's a cold game
but i i got the shot it was cool i'm like boom clean
but that's about it
i don't know she's a cool person we still hang out
you know
she keep losing i'm just gonna keep winning know what i mean
don't run from it run to it know what i mean
<laughter>
wait wait ten <t> ten or twenty years ago
i i was only seven years old you what do i tell my seven year old self
he wouldn't be able to comprehend the advice i would give what <w> what'd you say
oh oh oh yeah he wouldn't um be able to comprehend the advice i'd give him
i'd be like
just um fucking
read a little more books or something dude like
uh
i don't know man fucking it's gonna be okay you're you you you're great just keep
doing <ts> cool shit and have a ball
i don't know
i wouldn't know
i wouldn't wanna alter young me actually and this is why i say this
because
if i would to tell my young self to do something differently
i would not have grown into the person i am right now
to even be able to tell my young self something
if if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all that shit is real and time travel you know
anything i do in the past
would
this life would be now be a variable so me going back there
telling him to do something differently will alter the course of history and then the time stream that i'm in may not may cease to exist
you know what i'm saying so i really wouldn't wanna do that
i'll just be like do fuck up fuck up more even
but yeah make more mistakes 'cause the only way to
to be a better person is to make hella mistakes you know
at least that
at least that's like my my reckless like mindstate like yo if you're gonna fuck up fuck up hard
'cause you'll learn more from it
you know they say what do they say
um experience is the best professor
you know what i'm saying that's basically what that that's how i jive you know what i mean
<sniffle>
i'm proud of this life that i'm here doing stuff like this <laughter>
like i'm like so stoked
i've been around the country i've been on people's albums
i write i do voiceover works from time to time
and yeah i people know me i rap i ride bikes
i've infiltrated multiple
subculturals i mean subcultures and types of people in the city
scrubbed_entry
and um yeah man i don't know
i guess it's like i live my life like i'm running for mayor but i'm not really running for mayor i'm just running to be the best me i can be
so i'm kissing hands and shaking babies along the way and it it's been a rad fantastic time
