value
<synch>

the east coast
for work
uh rarely
i prefer it out here
uh i it's um not as nice as the lifestyle out here i like the weather better and uh just a lot of things about living here
it's my favorite city so
uh somewhat um
but i mostly
what's that
um
just um
i like to go to france a lot i like the food there and
um just the uh lifestyle the shopping that sort of thing
uh art history and marketing
uh well um
i became interested in high school and i thought it was a good um
classical education uh and
um
i interned at andy warhol's magazine when i was in high school and so
that
scrubbed_entry
hmm
yes
yes
uh
eh i'm pretty happy with what i'm i'm doing i do um consulting so
i write marketing plans that sort of thing
um
it's can be fairly hard
about writing a marketing plan
um
uh
i don't know it's hard it's hard to um <laughter> to talk to someone who's about it who's not in marketing it it requires just
um a knowledge of
uh
you know how it's how it how it's done and it it takes uh several months to to do one so
um
well i guess i'm i originally kind of shy but
um
i i become more outgoing just 'cause of work and stuff
um
i like to exercise uh i
i do um hiking with my dogs we walk up up and down a hill a couple times is it
good
uh
i don't remember
um
i don't know nothing comes to mind
mm
um sometimes i don't i don't clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and i feel bad when i i should always stay on top of that just getting to the car wash and stuff
uh
well i had a conflict with my brother
and so um i had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense and that was a a somewhat difficult
decision but just because of his angry behavior it wasn't it wasn't that difficult but um
you know it was <wa> it was somewhat difficult because i i loved him very much so
um
i'm not close to my family so
um
but i don't really have one
um i have a
a japanese friend uh oh i think the sensor came off i have a a japanese friend i'm i'm uh very close with she's like my kind of a my <m> my mother
and um
scrubbed_entry
uh
i just met them socially um
scrubbed_entry
uh i don't know nothing comes to mind
<talking to experimenter>
<talking to experimenter>
<talking to experimenter>
<talking to experimenter>
<talking to experimenter>
<talking to experimenter>
um pretty easy 'cause i keep a regular schedule
um just <jus> just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable
uh good
um well i'm recovering from p_t_s_d
so um i sometimes feel the the p_t_s_d and then i'll i'll take a medication for that
no it's just uh
it's just left over of the i'm still <sti> i still have the stress from it i'm still being treated for it
it i don't really have any
um i prefer not to talk about it
um in the past but it's treated
um
five years ago
uh i was i was just um very sad very depressed and so um i also had anxiety so i i went to
to doctor and um they helped me
and i did uh psychotherapy
yeah for the p_t_s_d though
um
i don't know i guess uh
it's just um
just kind of supportive because <be> because of the issues i have with my family it's it's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and um
you know it just uh gives me good feedback and helps me to make good decisions that sort of thing
i yeah i have nightmares about my family sometimes
yeah thanks
oh uh i i just try to uh sleep better i xxx i xxx i xxx before i go to sleep i sort of
like um
meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help
i feel happy all the time pretty much like i my dogs make me happy and you know my life is really happy so
mhm
uh i guess you know as a a nice person i'm thoughtful
um a good friend um <sigh>
and happy fun person
um
i don't know i mean i'm in my forties now so i'm pretty happy with with myself my <m> you know my um
you know uh
i've i've done a lot of a lot of work on myself in in therapy and stuff so i'm pretty
i wouldn't really change a lot i'm pretty happy with myself i mean not to sound conceited but i'm i'm pretty um
happy with myself now
uh well <we> that would that would be um my parents they're very abusive so
i don't <d> i <d> i don't talk to them anymore so <laughter> um any you know any times with them you know they they uh
you know said <sai> did terrible things to me so
i prefer not to talk about it
uh let's see
um
well i just started reading a book i i like to read um cookbooks and i was just reading a book called um when french women cook and it's about
uh
a woman's relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and the and the cooking and so i'm really enjoying that book
mhm
um
i usually you know um get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places
and and do a bit of cleaning and um
uh just uh relax
oh
yeah i would <wou> i would say um
to have better self-esteem 'cause i used to have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so um
you know i i wish i'd been happier <ha> happier in the past and you know it's taken me a long time to become happy because
um you know no matter what what i did whatever achievements i i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know struggling with
being depressed i didn't <di> i didn't even know why and now you know i realize
because of whatever events that it that it was from my parents from that um a relationship and so
i my i what the advice would be to not um have a relationship that um
is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship
um
just just <j> the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know um
you know i i believe it like your deeds are very important and i try to treat people in a good way and
and i guess you know i'm i'm proud of you know with my work like decisions i've made that um
that give me um
you <y> you know a a a
a uh a job that i i like that gives me a lot of
flexibility and i you know i do what i like and <sigh> um
and you know people like my work and
um and also my my dogs i'm really proud of them and
um
yeah i guess <gu> i don't know <laughter>
mhm
okay
thank you
bye
