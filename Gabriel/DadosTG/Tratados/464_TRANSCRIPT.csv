value
<sync>
mhm
um i'm doing good what about you
mhm
um
l_a <l> los los angeles but
i currently reside <res>reside in inglewood
wait did i answer your question
i don't know
okay
l_a
um
the murals
the ocean
what else
the people
my family's over here so
that's the best part
what about you
oh wait yeah <laughter>
um
i would say
the smog
yeah the air it could be cleaner
and
yeah
um
that's pretty <pre> i mean
there's good people and bad people too
but yeah for the most part it's all good
um yeah i've been to mexico <me> uh mexico and the temples
and northern california so yes
traveling
like cleaner air that's good it's healthier for your body
cleaner bloodflow
the um people
culture
and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends
yeah um any time
like right now
or when
okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples
and um it started raining
so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go
the the smaller the steps get
so
like people back then had
uh smaller feet
so what happened was
as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways
so my feet could measure up to the the the steps
but once you get up there it's a nice view
i yeah
uh general education but
um mainly art
yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes
um well
when i was a kid
i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so
i just pursued it
so
yeah
my dream job
would be to get paid for painting
painting art
yeah
um
yeah
pretty simple
um
it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion
um
persistence
and faith and will
you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed
mhm
i consider myself to be shy in certain um
time and places
but i am also out outgoing when
like i have the energy
so
i feel like it's well balanced you know
like i'm shy when it's
i guess
okay to be shy
you know
and i'm outgoing when
like the need to actually
um have fun or just explore
it feels good like
if that makes sense but yeah
<laughter>
yeah
to uh relax
um
either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter>
so that helps
and
i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax
you know especially when i use the color blue
because the color blue um relaxes me
and also green
when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down
yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah
my temper
um well my thoughts
my thoughts control my emotions
and my emotions
yeah that's pretty much how
my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad
or if i do get mad what will be the outcome
you know
so
controlling my temper is just
by training my thought
um <sigh>
the last time i argued with somebody
was with my with my father
and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine
so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no
so that kinda frustrated me
and
the way i handled it was like well
i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so
you know
and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace
so
yeah
my family
um it's pretty good
um
my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married
and my brothers and sisters
um we help one another out
so that's good it's just
yeah it's like a team
a situation i wish i could handle differently would be
hmm
that's a good question
i mean
can i get a scenerio
okay
um
a situation i could handle differently
well see that's the thing like i feel like
if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out
you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube
maybe
how would i handle the situation would be just by
uh failing um failing making mistakes
because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after
so
that's the best way i could answer your question
you know
yeah
a positive influence
pretty much
anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know
like
yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt
well they're not trying to be mean they're actually
good influences so i would say my friends
uh my mom my dad
my brother my sisters
yeah
mm
well see that's the thing like
you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife
but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware
and
it taught me how to read people a little bit more like
just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like
scar me
it did prepare me for like
the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like
you know like guns knives and all that stuff so
it's it's bad but it's good in the long term
you know because
if you get out of that slump
it's like
nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know
and
so yeah
the hardest
um
man
this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it
but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing
life changing
whether to continue school
college
or not
mm i kinda chose
to like
i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like
like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in
so that was a hard choice because there was no
um guarantee that i would
like
run into like the right people
but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so
yeah
yeah
yeah
um it's actually really easy
i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know
i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down
like like slow down my air pattern
yeah
mhm
lately
i've been feeling
good
i've been feeling like i have free will
like at this point in time i feel like
if i chose a path any path
with like
my heart
i could
get there you know
but i'm kind of like
still deciding it's like everything in all all these paths are in the air
just trying to make my own i don't know
that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will
so yeah
lately like in the past two weeks or today
<laughter>
okay
uh yeah you know like
um
yeah
things happen that would change like
my feelings and
for example right now it just happened
huh
for right now like
this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought
because
yeah it's like
it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far
like
one could take a thought
and then make it
reality
so that's kinda like shifting my thoughts right now
this experience this this whole experience
yeah
uh post traumatic stress disorder
no
depression i know how it's like to be depressed
but diagnosed by a doctor no
uh depression
how
how it feels
how does depression feel like
it feels like
it's like a bird in a cage
being depression is like
being <ss> a fish who can't swim in the water
i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings
um
pretty much it feels
like you're limited
but then the thing is
to get out of that depression
it's like you have to
awaken and change your perspective
and focus on
like i i would say colors colors help
and people talking to people helps
yeah
um being depressed
mm let's see
mm
i don't know
like
it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses
so
like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed
but then what happened i fixed it like
called up a friend and
met up with him and yeah
um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know
i'm talking to a virtual person it's pretty cool
and
yeah
right now i feel happy
<laughter>
um
sometimes hard headed
like he would try to teach me um
a certain lesson whether it's art
or just like in my character
and
yeah he would probably just describe me as like
like
like
he would listen
but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do
so pretty much like
i don't know
yeah i mean that's what he tells me
but yeah overall good person
um probably just exercise
um my diet food
my food intake
and yeah just exercise
pretty much it
my health
mm
i would say when i was like in middle school
or
in elementary
a little bit of high school too
but what it would
yeah what it would be was it would either be about
um
well pretty much my art <laughter>
like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like
like trash
and then i'd be like oh
damn
either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it
or what i would do back then would be like damn you know
just kinda dwell on that thought
and then just like
stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it
but yeah
usually it's um people's words
and ideas
that
yeah
yeah so that's it
regret
um yeah i got a couple things i regret
like what
well
sometimes i feel like i should've completed a whole university thing
but
i mean at the same time i feel like
if i really wanted to go
i would have gone
so yeah
that's kind of a regret in my head
ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual
well being
you know
learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i would teach myself
um
pick the right <r> people you surround yourself with because that   definitely has a major influence in your environment
uh certain events you would experience
and as far as your overall happiness
yeah
yeah among other things but yeah
what i'm most proud of right now
is my paintings
yeah
i'm proud of that because like
i feel like these paintings i'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate
you know it's like it's one of a kind and like it's it's there you know
it's has own signature so
so yeah i'm i'm pretty happy about that
yeah thank you
alright thank you
mhm
alright bye
<laughter>
