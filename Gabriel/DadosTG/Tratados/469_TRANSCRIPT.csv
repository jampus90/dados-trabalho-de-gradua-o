value
<synch>
yes
i'm okay
l_a
mm
uh there's a lot of variety um there's a lot of health-oriented stuff um
there's all kinds of food to eat you can go to the desert you can go to the you can go anywhere i mean there's a lot
and the weather's great
the traffic um
lately the change in weather it's kind of a little too unpredictable
but it mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people
uh i wouldn't say a lot just um occasionally
uh it's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe i wouldn't normally do different people um
learning about different people different customs um
depends i mean if it's a water real pretty water and xxx you know being in beautiful water um
relaxing
adventure i love adventure
uh <laughter> uh some time ago i went to cayman islands and um
went on i get seasick but my sister gave me some medication and i went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and i accidentally got back on the wrong boat
um
yeah and um they're really crazy they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat <laughter>
and i thought i was gonna drown 'cause the water was kinda rough i was really shocked they they wanted me to do that
yeah but i survived <laughter>
yeah pretty good
uh business management
but also
also hypnotherapy
i didn't hear that other question
um
well i came from a serious kinda family so that just seems something that would be universal that would cover a lot of different subjects
yes
yeah but um yes and no i mean now i kinda wish it was something different
um i like communication i love speaking and interviewing strangers um
i'm very outgoing um and funny so
probably would've been something more like either liberal arts communication that type of thing
uh dream job would just be out there you know like some of these people maybe on t_v exploring different places and getting paid for it and eh always like a fun adventure
uh interacting with people
um doing things i haven't done before
and um
helping people
you know on some way with what i do xxx that they can see you know
that i'm uncoordinated and in some ways and you know they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too <laughter>
uh i watch t_v i go work out um i go walking i recently got like a a bike that i kinda sort of fixed up
um go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping
interact with friends call them see them
that type of thing
talk to strangers
um
depends on the situation there's a bunch of times i'm good at it
um if it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me it's a little tougher
or people who are like really rude you know with the way they cut you off
almost <laughter> um
luckily not
you know i'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes where if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot i'll
i'll confront them on that sometimes
um
might've been with my sister um
it had to do with um i'm not sure of the topic but um whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it it sounds childish about who was right you know 'cause she thinks she's always the smarter one 'cause she's older
uh sometimes it's frustrating 'cause it's like it's a no win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody 'til you know they acknowledge that she's right
um other times i just let it go and let her rattle on 'cause it's
it's kinda nonproductive
uh i'm real close to i see my parents almost every weekend um more close to my mother um
i have a twin sister
i stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and i've got two other sisters so i stay in touch with
all of 'em
you know it's a mixed bag you know um
we kinda have assertive aggressiveness in us a little bit
<sigh>
but also
um
well me <laughter> um and um
ever i mean strangers sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me um
strangers have been
very um sometimes unexpectedly very nice
uh i could be shopping and um you know i'm
maybe i can't reach something and some guy'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out um
uh that type of thing or um
if somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody'll like
commiserate <laughter> you know and um
xxx
um
i had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me um 'cause he thought i
didn't like his dog it was you know i'm not crazy about dogs but um he kinda flipped out for a year and a half and um
just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around um i wish i'd confronted that back then
because i
you know but it created a lot of anxiety for me 'cause i feel like i could've nipped it in the bud and to instead of having to deal with the um
major stress from it
now he and i don't talk at all i just feel it's best he's kind of odd
hmm
god there's been a lot
um
sometimes breaking up with somebody or um
<sigh>
yeah it's usually or getting rid of a friend
that type of thing
um
sometimes i feel guilty about
some of my past behavior with people um
where maybe i wasn't as understanding um
eh <sigh> when i was younger i stole things you know that's not the best behavior and um
and it's stuff like that
oh god there's a lot of 'em um
i wish i could erase you know how um
tough my dad was on us as children
and um
erase a lot of memories of men i dated that just didn't work out well at all
and um
yeah
i can drop off like
right away
yeah
cranky <laughter> irritated um
snarky <laughter>
um
a bit out of sorts um i've had some anxiety uh with money um and relationships 'cause i haven't been in one for so long
male <laughter> um
just a lot of anxiety um
mm yeah
<sigh> take a deep breath um
try and do positive things you know sometimes
um eat healthier work out more um talk to my friend about it
that type of thing
try and look for interesting activities to do
to distract me
<sniffle>
well not officially but i know <sigh> you know from
mm things i've experienced that i've had <ha> i've you know i get very anxious in certain situations
um yeah uh it's usually triggered by um
sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me um if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally
uh or sometimes if they're too much in my space <s> my uh space you know where i am it bothers me
um yeah a long time ago
it was ages ago
maybe over ten years ago
fifteen years ago
um
i was depressed <laughter> i mean i <laughter> know that's nothing to laugh about but i mean it's kinda
in a circle um
just
to um
wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more
um
feeling stuck in certain thoughts um having a lot of negative thoughts um feeling of hopelessness helplessness
that type of thing
xxx
um
i go occasionally it's a different type um
i'll go see a hypnotherapist um sometimes to release <rel> release <rel> release anxiety that's in me
yes i do very useful
um
a lot more awareness of myself and other people um
learning more control more confidence um better self-esteem um willing to try
even more things you know whether i know the outcome or not you know of the unknown i'll experiment a lot more

type of person
um
well it'd be great to uh look even younger uh or be younger
if that was humanly possible <laughter> um
be even more patient with people
i think um you know not get frustrated like if i think somebody's not very smart
uh sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people
