value
<synch>
yes i am
i am pretty good
uh i was born in los angeles california
yes
um i like the fact that everything is close by um all the stores the shops
xxx
um the traffic <laughter>
um i've traveled but not too much
uh going away from your usual days um exploring new sights
um
three weeks no a month ago i went to las vegas
uh with <wit> me and my friends and we just went sightseeing
um
in las vegas we went to the hoover dam
and um it was breathtaking um
the it was really big and we saw the the big canyon and it was impressive i've never seen something like that before
i studied nursing
uh i graduated two months ago
so i took my uh board exam to be licensed
and i passed so i'm just waiting for my license in the mail
my dream job is to be a registered nurse
um
long time ago when i was a little boy i got injured
and my parent had to take me to the hospital
and
um the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg
and i saw all of that and that made me want to pursue it the medical field
uh yes i am very happy
uh my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it's it it's in between <laughter>
uh i am close i am very close to them um
mm
if i have a problem i i go to them for help
um
someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend
since elementary school
yes
yes uh we've known each other since we were in the third grade
and we've uh we've gone to elementary middle school and high school together
and he lives like two blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of <o> of mine
i am shy
um
i really don't know i've i've always been a quiet person
um ever since i can remember
hmm what do i do i
i go into my room i turn my a_c on
and i just relax in my bed <laughter>
i am pretty good i'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes
the last time i argued with someone
was about
um
work
i was disappointed
um not angry just disappointed
because my manager
he wanted me to
do something faster than what i usually can handle
and he already knew that
um my workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad
mm
i cannot remember one
the hardest decision
i ever had to make was
dropping out of school
um
i felt that i didn't really belong
uh far away from home
and so
i was just thinking ahead um i was in a major that i didn't really like
and so
i decided to just not go next semester and go back home to l_a
um right now that i'm looking at it yes i i am very happy that i did that
because i wouldn't have gone to nursing school and i wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now
hmm i don't have an event
um
it depends on the days um where i work or where i don't work
yes
right now i i work at um at a retail store early in the morning i
i go at three in the morning
and i get out at ten a_m
so it's really hard for me to get a good night's sleep
when i don't sleep well i can be a little bit grumpy
uh irritated
or just frustrated with the situation
lately i've been okay <o> okay i've been good
uh no i have not
no
no
hmm
the last time i was really really happy and excited was when i found out that i passed my license board exam to be a nurse
<laughter>
my best friend would've described <des> would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy
um physically speaking i would change how i look from the outside
um
i i'm a little <l> i'm overweight
and i would like to
lose some weight and just look good from the outside
hmm
i don't have one
no i don't
um this one time
i <sigh> at my work uh it's a retail store
i
i kinda took some merchandise without buying it
um it was a risk that i took
but
um since no one was around and
the opportunity <opp> the opportunity was right there for me to get it i just got it and i took it home
i don't know
yes last weekend i went to i i went yard saleing with my family
and it was pretty fun and going out to different yard sales and
finding uh random stuff
um i bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was
on it was only for two dollars and so i got it
and now it's in my room and i sit on it <laughter>
i am most proud of is the fact that i am a nurse um
that i am a nurse um i'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and
after that i would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and xxx and nursing homes
bye
