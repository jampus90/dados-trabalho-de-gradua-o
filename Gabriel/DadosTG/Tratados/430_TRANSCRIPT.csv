value
<synch>
yeah sure
i'm fine thank you
i am from los angeles
well you can't beat the weather
um and
i just think the familiarity of home just uh makes me feel comfortable here
smog
uh
rudeness although it doesn't compare to new york it's
um <laughter> people can be unbearable when they're rude
um not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no
i just think seeing different places it's um
learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest
um
let's see
i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's uh still <st> still only in america but i just think um
being from l_a i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger
and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh
it was it was quite an experience and uh i didn't think any place was uh
i didn't <di> i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown l_a <laughter> but i think times <time> i think <laughter> times square's got us beat
too many to mention i i don't even know where to start
suppose it depends on the situation
um
i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading
uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh
you know just uh things that uh i don't have to um exert myself too much uh helps me relax
<sigh>
in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter>
ah probably argued with my roommate
<psh> couple days ago but uh
that happens we're friends uh it's a loving argument <laughter> if if you will
uh i met this roommate about six seven years ago we just uh kind of
um
kinda moved around the same social circles and just got along
it's cool i mean
guess you know like
we do argue uh we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i'd rather live with than than her she's she's cool
hmm
how much time do we have
uh <laughter>
it's just too numerous to mention um
i i i wouldn't know how to answer that
i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly
cared about but knowing
knowing that it just wasn't going to work um
that was very difficult
just weighed pros and cons and just thought
it just wasn't going to work um
no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship
there was something missing
and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and
just knew it was over
no
so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets but things you erase from your memory
oh there's a lot uh too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that
the same girl
that i broke up with
she was the she was a girlfriend <laughter> of uh a a best friend of mine
uh they were separated for for
several years
and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we do not speak i wish uh my regret is i wish i
i would've handled that better
<scoff>
um
it's it's funny see as i as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for 'em and i still love them and i think they love me i
my mother and my father are both alive mm don't interact a whole lot i'm very close to my older sister
my older sister
um
she's just
strong no nonsense uh
she's short yet a firecracker and i've always liked that about her she uh
uh
she always felt makes me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like uh another son to her <laughter> in a way
uh suppose it depends on my stress level
um
when i have a lot on my mind
i have difficult sleeping and uh other times it just
if i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio listen <lis> uh watching t_v reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep
crabby uh i suppose like anybody else um
tired
listless you know all the normal things i suppose happen when somebody doesn't sleep well
i feel good
mm no not really um
no no i i wouldn't say
i have
no i have not
yes i have
i was diagnosed probably about
about five years ago
i think uh i always knew there was a problem
i always knew there was some
i i i think i always knew before i got treatment that
there was some issue emotionally and hmm and lot of things that are very hard to explain
and i just was tired of feeling that way so i sought help
think just uh
lethargy uh
uh no desire to do anything uh motivation just was wasn't there
um
think normal depression type things uh
um
social <socia> i became socially awkward which was a little bit different for me 'cause uh growing up i was
you know quite talkative <laughter>
i do
i'm sorry say again
gotcha um it does i think it does
well um <sigh>
i think the number one thing and this is what i'm amazed about is the temper i think i've uh it's allowed me to
to step back from certain situations
and not take them so seriously
and not get so tense or angry
and then react
i think it's it it's calmed me down for the most part
now it's becoming it it it's becoming routine
uh initially it was very difficult
when i was five years old <laughter>
oh no when <wh> when you're a kid there's nothing really to
um
there's nothing to be sad about you're a kid
my best friend
um
a jerk i don't yeah
uh i have a dry i have a dry sense of humor so uh you know
my best friend would probably uh
i think the
the banter back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know it's all in love
um i wish i could be taller
i wish i could be more
inclined to play basketball so i then become go to the n_b_a and be a millionaire i know that's all unrealistic but just answering honestly
hmm
anything i regret haven't we asked asked this before i mean so many don't know where to start
mm that's a good one
wow
um
wow i don't know
i you know that's a good one i'd have <ha> i'd have to think about that i don't i wouldn't wanna answer that uh that's a good one
usually you're asked um
what you'd what you know how you feel ten twenty years from now looking back i don't know what advice i'd give myself
something i really enjoyed
um
hmm i love um
there are several things i like to do um uh you know i uh i enjoy playing basketball i i i love watching it i love watching all sports for that matter what brings me real joy the past few years was um
become a hobby of mine is is uh rescuing dogs fostering dogs and finding them them homes uh it's <laughter>
i guess it's become quite a a hobby of mine and uh
sometimes i find lost dogs and i'm able to find their owner and sometimes i'm not so when i'll tell you what there's nothing <noth>
to find the owner and i just found an owner last week for a small dog i found eh there is not greater feeling 'cause the man told me <laughter> the man told me how his um
how his <hi> how his daughter
or was just crying when she left so to be able to give her give him back that was that was cool
i think for somebody that um didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating that's something that
i uh
i take
pride in though i don't show it or speak about it often
<laughter> yeah
you look you look like my friend rachel it's funny
<laughter>
