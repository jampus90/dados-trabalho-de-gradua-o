hello
yeah
i'm alright a little tired
uh i live in culver city um but originally i i was i grew up in venice
um the beach
fast drivers
um the city i've lived in utah i don't really like
anything else but the city
um
i don't know many people who live here anymore
uh traffic
it's too big
but it's home
<laughter>
uh i've been out of the country a few times
uh seeing new <n> <clears throat>
seeing new places
when i was fourteen i went to costa rica to visit my father
and i was there for two weeks and that was the last time i've been there
in costa rica
um
seeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker
um joy i was happy excited kinda scared
it wasn't my decision it was my mom's
she'd planned the trip
yeah
uh i wanted to be an art major but
i didn't understand why i was in math classes among other classes and i thought i was wasting my time so i decided i really didn't wanna do that
so i moved back to l_a
i don't really have a dream job uh i
would like to be self-employed though
right now i'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer but i'm not really sure
uh around new people i'm very reserved but the people i do know i'm a lot more outgoing and talkative
<laughter>
um
to relax
i
go on walks i walk my dog a lot
um i call my girlfriend if i wanna calm down
i also do uh
meditation
and self-hypnosis
i try
it
depends on
what <wha> how i'm feeling
or how upset i am or how calm i'm trying to be
if i'm really upset it's a lot harder for me to calm down and
bring myself down through meditation or through self-hypnosis
but
yeah
um
i'm alright at it sometimes i lose it
i yell when i lose my temper and
i have put holes in walls
not
yet <sigh>
last night me and my mom got in an argument
it was
about me buying a
ticket last night for a greyhound
to go to utah
i'm going up there to work for a few weeks and make a little bit of money and i needed to buy my ticket a week in advance and i didn't want to do it last night
that situation last night
i wish i had not blown up or
gotten as raged enraged as i can over the situation 'cause it escalated
my little sister i'm very close with
um she's fifteen years old she's about to turn sixteen in a few days
uh i would do anything for her she is the world to me my mom um we fight we push each other's buttons
i believe she views me as my father she believes that i
will not succeed at anything
sad
it's okay
um
i wish
i could forget most of my high school years or my sophomore year
uh i just didn't like high school or my sophomore year
i
uh
getting sober and
going
uh into to
a drug rehab
um
when i was sixteen i got
um <sigh> i just started doing a a few different drugs and
it got out of hand i guess and
my mom was trying to get me help and i didn't want the help so i kept uh escaping to different places and running away and not
wanting to be in the places so i finally agreed to go to utah and try and get sober
scrubbed_entry
um
he's my best friend my entire life ever since i can remember and we we grew up together
he used to use drugs with me and he's been sober for more than a year now
almost impossible
um i either have to have no sleep the night before to get a few hours
or i i just i don't i don't sleep well i'm against taking pills
and i stopped smoking marijuana and so now i just i don't sleep
or haven't been
the past few weeks
yeah it's not fun
i lay in bed until i finally fall asleep in the early morning
or i watch t_v until late at night or netflix
i'm out of it i'm tired i'm groggy
i'm a lot more likely to my anger is a lot more likely to come out
i've been alright this weekend is been better than most my girlfriend has stayed at my place the entire weekend so
i've been happy
um
<deep breath> <sigh>
i don't
i'm not as irritable
no
but
yes
i was probably
i was i believe i was twelve the first time i was diagnosed i've been diagnosed multiple times though
um
most recent time being less than a year ago
uh my mom sought help for me she saw that i was unhappy and she became worried
no
uh i stopped in on june first when i graduated my uh drug rehab program
in utah
of last year
i'm learned coping skills
so i'm able to
calm myself down when
i'm angry easier i i i know how to stay away from the my trigger points and getting away from staying away from being angry
or becoming depressed
it can be
if the person's willing to change
and wanting it
two days ago
it was because i was with my girlfriend we were having a moment
and so i was just overwhelmed by the happiness i guess
<laughter>
trustworthy
um
funny
shit i don't um
outgoing smart athletic he would um
yeah
i wish i wasn't i was so short fused i
wish i wasn't depressed i wish i didn't feel like i needed something to help me sleep
i wish i was just completely dependable on myself
um
when i was younger my father would uh
he once hit my dog in front of me 'cause he was mad at me
so he started hitting the dog and i don't that was probably the biggest thing xxx i was little i remember just being sad
yeah
everyone has something they regret
<deep breath> <sigh> not to be so naive
hmm
uh
i went to hypnosis
i had a a
an appointment for hypnosis a few days ago
it was really relaxing really calming and i feel like it could help me
um one of my mom's colleagues
referred her to a
psychiatrist who's really good with a_d_h_d and patients like that
<laughter>
um
i'm athletic
um
i'm nice
i like to
i put other people before myself
most of the time i don't know if that's a negative quality or positive
i
i don't know
my ideal weekend i would either go
to a a few parties or i'll i'll hang out with my girlfriend
out in fullerton or i'll be in los angeles or the beach
um
i haven't really felt like i've accomplished anything to be adequately proud of but i
did very well in sports in high school and
that's really it
k
bye
