about three years ago
four years ago
couple years ago
my mood was just not right
i was always feeling down and depressed and <sniffle> lack of energy always wanting to sleep
um lack of interest
i've gone to therapy it has been useful for me in the past
is it useful for me now i don't know i don't have health insurance
um
i would love to talk to someone i just feel like i don't have anyone
so i don't depend on anyone
oh yeah i've always felt depressed in my life
mm
lack of energy
wanting to sleep a lot
lack of interest
my appetite was uncontrollable either lack of or i was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things
yes
my sister just passed away
it's alright six months ago
and i became
homeless and jobless two weeks ago
and it got to a point where
i just missed her and i wanted to be with her
so
mm
pretty dysfunctional family
you know really can't depend on them
that's why i just depend on myself <sigh> so
it is what it is what are you gonna do
i'd like to give up but
my parents just buried their daughter six months ago they don't wanna bury their other daughter
so
<sigh>
i don't know 
i don't know just uh
i just haven't had good luck
i was a corporate manager for twenty years
and uh
who would've known twenty years ago what advice i would've given myself because
i tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work
and so now it's just uh it's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and
get my life back together
um
i don't know what advice i would give myself
when i started with my corporate job twenty years ago
because i didn't know i'd be here twenty years later
you know
really happy
um
a couple days ago this week
<sigh> i've been trying to make ends meet
i've got a lot of things sprouting
i've got a lot of things
that are happening for me but i need like two more weeks here in l_a
so i can connect the dots but
financially i don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks
so
i was happy because i was getting call backs and
um <sigh> things were starting to look up for me but it's just um time again isn't on my side so my car is packed and i'm hitting the road
and i'm taking off and i'm leaving l_a so
uh loyal
emotional
strong
that's it
um
i have been lately
um i was an extrovert for
twenty years when i was a corporate manager
and now i am quite an introvert and i stick to myself
uh circumstances in my life i don't feel as confident
i don't feel
as uh charming
and as social
mm
i don't know
it's hard to say
can't really answer that one
thank you
bye
