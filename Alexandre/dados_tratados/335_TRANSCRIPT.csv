value
yes
i'm okay 
uh i'm from here originally los angeles 
mhm
um i like the weather 
and my family's here which is why i'm here i moved away for a while
uh i like that there's a lot of
culture <cult> even though everyone says there's not culture in l_a there is a lot of culture there's theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people i like the diversity   
mhm
um 
well i don't like that i had to move back kind of against my will <laughter> so starting a new career
uh starting over in my career it so that's not really something
uh well i moved back 'cause my dad was sick 
so
thank you 
thank you
so that's why i'm here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous so 
uh
acting
theater
it was
mhm
yeah 
yeah i am  
i'm an actor i uh right now i'm doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and 
that sort of thing 
um well my parents are both
artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then uh i was went to study musical theater
and somewhere along the lines i realized that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose but i still do both 
mhm
no i don't 
uh i don't usually have trouble talking to people uh i'm pretty friendly
i can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within five minutes of meeting me which i feel is a mark of an extrovert <laughter>   
<laughter> um 
i take a bath or read a book
uh go out with my friends
go to the theater
uh
eh sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or any of that going for a walk 
mhm yoga
things that make me mad um 
injustice <laughter> i can be very righteously indignant i suppose um 
people who don't see those things and people who've who have a like entitlement i think entitlement and sense of privilege that can make me mad 
yeah 
uh 
it depends i usually <usual> a lot of times it's i argue my case <laughter> i guess <laughter> um or i i call my best friend usually and complain
talk to her about it 
pretty good pretty good i don't have too much of a temper 
um
like a real argument or like a debate 
<laughter> um
if was a real argument it probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argued about why we broke up stupid things like that 
eh i think i was kind of
over it by then but 
it was at times 
<laughter> 
um 
the last time i felt really happy 
was
like really happy
probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night i had a good time
uh
scrubbed_entry
it is it's nice
it's nice
my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything um she would describe me as  
uh compassionate
and
uh having a a strong sense of who i am 
i think
yeah she also she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that's something that she 
makes fun of me for um because i do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing
nothing bad we have a very good relationship
hmm
yeah yeah it has <laughter> not terrible trouble but but yeah it's gotten me in trouble before sure 
no
i haven't 
no but i think i had it 
but i never went to a doctor 
um 'cause i had a i had a traumatic situation uh where somebody injured me
and i
i feel <fe> when i looked up p_t_s_d later i realized <reali> i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like going back into situations like that i would get panicky and um it was very    
uh i held on to it for a really really long time
i think um
i think that i did have it but i just i don't know 'cause i never i never saw anyone about it  
um 
sometimes yeah uh
certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or um
it happened in a in an acting class
so sometimes certain teachers if they
criticize in a certain way
i start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like it's something that
someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it eh sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky yeah 
no
well i mean my dad is sick so not great 
but um but considering not terrible 
um i've been having bad dreams 
uh 
uh just like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad  
um 
like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you looked them up always say like there's something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so     
it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so  
which way 
okay 
easy very easy 
i am tired and maybe somewhat irritable goofy i get really goofy
yeah 
um
i
am fairly non-judgmental 
of other people i i i stay open-minded
uh i can make most people laugh i'm funny
uh creative 
um
i
yeah those are some of the best ones i'd say  
yeah 
i love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning uh and just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels uh i like most things about traveling i even i even like flying i like all of it
well i just finished a tour a couple months ago um going up and down the east coast and then across the u_s and uh performing for kids all over  
yeah and then we ended here in l_a 
yeah yeah it was great it was a good time 
yeah
um 
lemmi think we 
we went to 
the hot springs the naturally occuring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to unwind
yeah 
a lot of people i i would say
um i mean my dad comes to mind certainly
uh my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well  
uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some <so> a few of my best friends from high school um and college that i've kinda grown up with and
become who i am with them
yeah 
mhm
uh small things sure 
yeah
uh
i regret 
the way that i dealt with
a friendship that was ending once uh i regret 
committing to certain people that i've dated 
uh 
but nothing huge i i tend to go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time
like being upset about things i've done in the past 
hmm
stand up for yourself 
um 
<laughter> don't date felons <laughter> uh
i think that i
i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself
i think i i really internalize the idea of like
you know women being too needy or uh or um
i don't know those kinds of things and then xxx and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that
and it's still something i work on 
<laughter> i'm glad you think so 
um 
<sigh>
that's a good question uh 
my friends and family 
and uh 
i my talents
i would say 
yeah 
yeah my ability to take situations and 
take bad situations and continue and
uh make the best of everything 
alright 
<laughter> thank you 
goodbye goodbye <laughter>
