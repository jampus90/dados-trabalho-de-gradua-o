value

fear of earthquakes
psychology
i am
i go to harbor college
i am
um wish i would've went sooner but better late than never
probably
i'm not sure i haven't really thought about it i wanna work in the field of psychology but i'm not sure if i wanna work with children or adults so i haven't really decided 
no <laughter>
i don't know
i just don't
maybe once a year
um june actually i went to uh orlando florida
sometimes
yeah not as
i'm sorry
um
watch t_v read a book
talk on the phone
mhm
mad
mm <sigh>
my mom gets in my business <laughter>
other than that um
i guess just frustrations with my son
no <laughter>
um the hardest thing is um
raising a child with a disability
not knowing how you can help him
it is it's very hard
i don't sugarcoat it at all
just having my children
they're a blessing i love 'em <laughter>
with all the good and the bad it's a part of me and i just love the fact that i'm helping mold them into 
good human beings <laughter>
we're really close
i mean my family's small we live within blocks of each other but yeah we're close 
good or bad
<laughter>
most memorable
just giving birth for the first time it was just amazing
my son is nine now so i still remember it like it was yesterday
<laughter>
like i was
being born again myself i don't know how to explain it it just very
emotional <laughter>
i don't know <laughter> i guess i have a lot of regrets but
none that i really wanna mention i guess <laughter>
stay in school <laughter> don't get emotionally involved
and um let people
deter you from your goals <laughter>
oh yeah
definitely
did you wanna move on
i'm okay i mean i'm pretty easygoing 
for the most part i don't really have a temper per se
things frustrate me more than they anger me
xxx
oh that's easy <laughter> with my mother she's like um
i guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to
socialize <laughter> she feels that
i'm married with children so i should stay at home
like ninety nine percent of the time
and i wanted to go out and socialize with some ex co-workers
and she
basically
kinda put me down for it as if i don't spend enough time with my children <laughter> 
it does
and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her
because i always think gosh i don't wanna get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day
but
she gets kinda intrusive <laughter> i don't know <laughter>
oh i know um after the semester ended when i noted that i 
you know i did well in school 'cause i had been it had been a long time since i went to school so
when i received my grades you know a and a b i was like wow okay i can do this and it made me happy
and that was about
a few weeks ago i guess mhm
thank you
my mom i know it's good and bad <laughter> i mean for the most part my mom's been a positive influence you know it's just sometimes
you know she gets a little
like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm gonna make my own decisions now and 
pretty much have to let me do what i need to do
<sigh> a lotta 
heavy breathing <laughter> i mean i walk sometimes when i get a lil' frustrated whatever i'll just go take a walk
you know or um just try not to think about it
thank you <laughter>
yes
yes
the navy
i was nineteen
yeah
<laughter> yeah
i didn't have any other options
<laughter>
i am i probably should've stayed in a lil' longer i was only in for four years but 
you know i wanted to experience life outside the military so i did my
enlistment and then i got out
it made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military i can notice a big difference as far as you know how i live my life and how they live theirs
um just made me a little bit more responsible
thank you <laughter>
i worked in the medical field for about five years
and uh
oh thank you <laughter>
but um it wasn't for me i wanted to do something lil' bit different i didn't wanna do patient care i wanted to work with people but not necessarily as a patient care
provider so
i started going to school and then i met my husband i stopped going to school
got married and i started working in a telecommunications field
and then we you know conceived our child and after that
you know <laughter>
<laughter>
i think i'm caring well i know i am i'm very caring you know i'm very honest  to a fault sometimes you know i try to
be as honest as possible with people
sometimes it can hurt their feelings but you know you gotta be honest you can't let people
think that you know
you're not trusting
and if
mm yeah probably i don't i never really thought about it
i don't know
<laughter>
maybe i don't really think about it i just try to be the best person that i can be
you know so
all i can do i can't live for what other people think i can only do what i need to do <laughter> 
um
i don't know
<laughter> i never really thought about it 
i guess it just you know being around my kids you know i just love being around my children
and that's always puts me in a good mood <laughter>
thank you
okay like i said a lil' tired you know but
you know for the most part okay you know i'm dealing with situations that
well i go to bed really early so
long as i go to bed early i get a good night's sleep but i wake up early as well so
<laughter> it's kinda like
good and bad a lil' bit i go to bed like eight eight thirty and then i wake up at like one one thirty
so
<laughter>
very moody
very irritable short short-tempered i guess
if anything i think i'm thinking more positively
you know like i said especially with my son having a disability you know i i look at it as if you know
it's not all bad
i mean he has challenges eh but i'm dealing with them a lot better
you know as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know i'm just finding more avenues to work with him you know
different resources to help him as opposed to just feeling guilty or sad and depressed about it
thank you
no
occasionally
who doesn't <laughter>
i don't know can we skip that question
<laughter>
<sigh> green <laughter> seems to be the word kinda like um
yeah probably green like
naive a little <laughter>
but at the same time smart i think she'll describe me as smart 
mhm
yeah
okay
no problem
bye
