value
yes 
okay 
connecticut
um 
to be an actor <laughter> 
well i moved to san francisco in ninety four and then i moved to atlanta in ninety six and then i moved out here to be an actor and i became a realtor instead 
um to be on a t_v show an actor 
it's pretty hard to get discovered and uh 
you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented  
<laughter> yeah 
not really no i don't travel that much i used to move um every couple years to a different city and then i've been here for a while so i don't travel much
the weather
um there's always something to do
and um
that's pretty much it <laughter> 
um
the people here tend to be a little more rude
and um it's just always a fast pace 
well when i moved here i was twenty five so it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city you can have a lot of fun   
and then i got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now i'm old and i'm not making any money so times are tough 
no no i'm much <mu> much of more <m> more of an extrovert 
um
when i don't get what i want <laughter> and um 
rude people 
and um 
just inconsiderate people 
i'm pretty good um at controlling my temper when i'm not uh like if i if i drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but uh <ss noise> when i don't drink i'm pretty good at controlling my temper  
uh the last time i argued with somebody was 
somebody that owed me money 
uh i live uh in west hollywood 
no no no i live alone i have a dog
it's good i mean i don't like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in are not that noisy and the ones below i just can't stand because they argue with me  
huh
why because they 'cause my hardwood floors they say that
eh i've been there for ten years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors 
yeah 
what was the question 
my mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track
she lived with me for the last ten years until she recently moved to rhode island to live with my brother
very close to my mother um not so close with my brother mm we're close but we're not like close close
um
so i mean we love each other we just don't really understand each other all the time 
outgoing um
life of the party 
ambitious um 
and sometimes cut-throat 
um <psh psh> what am i most proud of 
being always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i wanna be
i'm generous i'm loyal
uh i'm friendly
i'm accommodating
and um 
that's about it 
no
yes 
uh about four years ago 
um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft
and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving
um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did   
thank you 
um okay i'm panicky about the job situation 
um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now 
so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation 
yeah 
um 
yeah i mean 
well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing 
yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink  
um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself
now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving 
uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um
they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would 
make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin 
just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  
um not really 
always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i
eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed
i do
at some point i've had
some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists 
um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me
and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen  
and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist
um
well i'm not going to therapy now but 
the therapy that i had before um 
was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication
um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better 
um i just
i wasn't getting the right therapists recently
so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so 
mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know 
um 
i can't really think of anything right now 
um 
it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy 
thank you <sniffle>
um 
okay when i was a kid
um 
i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it 
so then a little while later my father 
came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them 
so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that  
oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences  
yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so 
um
just the way that i've treated people before when
i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people
when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so 
so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable 
get in a career that is really stable 
like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney
something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so
you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things 
um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work 
uh when i'm helping other people 
uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood 
okay thank you 
you're welcome thank you 
bye
