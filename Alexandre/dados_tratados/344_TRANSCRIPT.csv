mm disciplined more uh
more motivated
uh you get a lot of things done more <laughter> even when you don't wanna do 'em
you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that that that you really needed to get done but you didn't wanna do it but it got done
uh like uh 
you had to uh do a lot of cleaning
uh you had to wake up pretty early you had to do a lot of p_t you had to uh stay up to like two three o'clock in the morning you didn't wake back up until four or five
yes <y> uh <laughter> to a certain point yes 
after the military i joined the national guard and i did uh fifteen sixteen years in there uh i was
uh excuse me ma'am i didn't hear that <th> quite hear that
uh what made me decide to do that 
uh
just the motivation just you know really wanted a career see if i could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit yeah   
thank you 
it wasn't that easy 
uh i mean i'm sorry it was easy it didn't bother me too much to go back to civilian life 
yeah it didn't bother me at all i just <ju> i adjusted pretty well 
uh <sigh> history basically a lot um 
yeah just basically history

oh no it's okay it's okay we can all i can heal i can get better hopefully i will 
yes i try to keep a 
excuse me ma'am
i guess i don't 
my dream job would probably be
working with others working with young people working with kids seeing that they get the uh the right and proper uh uh education that's you know
that's due to them so they can be productive in the life of society as we live in today 
yeah 
excuse me 
<sigh>
what i think about 'em i think uh they should uh be more
more uh <sigh> xxx i mean they should they should <sh> participate <tapicitate> more in what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to uh
really achieve something
within their lives to give them the mm to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life
'cause a lot of 'em don't get it
<sigh> when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing 
uh <sigh>
it really eeks me i mean really bothers me and when people
talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just giving me the the run-around <laughter> won't you just be straight up with me
that can be very frustrating
uh and really when people do really i'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <laughter> that really botthers me too  
uh spray painting on the wall 
uh
just
throwing garbage anywhere and not picking it up
uh not really being uh you know not really being 
hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean 
yeah 
<sigh> what i do when i'm annoyed uh i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you
and it's something that's not really me
but uh i'm learning to
really let go of it a lot you know just you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like i'm not in control i can't control it
yeah i have only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good
it's not good for me
oh my temper can be controlled i can control it pretty well 
uh 
i i don't know i think it probably was my sister
and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and i have mine don't tell me what to do
yeah 
we real close i can get along with 'em we're real close i have no problems with them  
yeah very good 
uh 
this morning <laughter> 
yeah i wake up pretty you know i i first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so
when my spirit's in connection
with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world i i feel pretty good  
yes 
uh <sigh> up and down you know
up because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life than just not doing anything at all
and then other times where you wanna get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's road blocks in the way but uh
i'm learning how to uh overcome those road blocks as well
uh 
well for instance uh looking to go to school and i was having problems uh getting enrolled in school
i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and uh to do it so i'm like okay it's well it's gonna get done <laughter>
yeah 
uh can you repeat that one more time ma'am 
uh yes i have 
see i had to be
uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh
i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry 
and i have to take 
excuse me ma'am 
uh it's not hard at all 'cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh
and then go from there and find out what's what's really bothering you 
it's very seldom 
uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh getting that type of sleep
would be would be great 
because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so 
<sigh>
i i think it is and i don't know what it's triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone 'cause i'm a veteran 
at the uh v_a about the situation now
about the p_t_s_d basically right now 
excuse me ma'am 
uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression
uh i noticed all this in me and uh
i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help 
and that's that's basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasn't wrong with it something wasn't right with me 
and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it  
and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah 
somewhat yes it is somewhat 
'cause i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist 
well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell 'em my situation and we usually will go over the problem
and uh
i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit 
yeah 
it's a good thing
excuse me ma'am
no
no not really 
my best friend 
uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh 
think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it
so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me
yeah they see something in me they wish that they had  
excuse me ma'am
uh can you be a little bit more specific 
oh okay 
uh books crossword puzzles
uh walking
that's about it 
i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because 
this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on 
because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future 
yeah 
<sharp inhale>
uh <sigh> more education uh 
being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing
like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago 
uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life 
uh <sigh>
yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivate me
to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot
and uh
he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done  
excuse me ma'am 
uh <sigh>
that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated
and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished
if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it
oh wow huh 
oh really and you know what i really enjoyed
was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life
and school was one of 'em uh 
and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me 
yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school
and uh yeah that and that and that's what gets me going
oh it is and i love it and uh this is going to be accomplished 
thank you 
goodbye
