value
yes
<laughter> 
fine how are you
uh watts california but now i live in west l_a 
<laughter> yes
i love uh the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that um you're thirty minutes away from everything it's a great city  
the traffic it's terrible 
i studied child development 
yeah actually i uh teach children how to be safe in uh traffic situations 
oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies 
well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film
<laughter> 
last time i made a film just this last october made a short film 
<laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally
thanks <laughter> 
really mad uh 
<laughter> really mad i
you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad 
yeah 
<laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school 
no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that
you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you
you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um
other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy  
<sigh> 
the hardest thing about being a parent 
i would say is
trying to give
that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so
it gets very uh 
um
annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt
it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so   
mm
yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch
but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it
you as a parent you're happy they got it 
<sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they 
yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs
she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but
you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for
having the children tell you that you're a good person so
i like that 
hmm
oh <laughter> my god they're
ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity
and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but
they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or
you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information
and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed
and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong
hmm
me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation 
argued 
i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about
gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember 
it was petty
yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it
hmm
my fiancee
<laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at
at a charter <ch> not a charter school but at a
recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didn't see each other for an entire year
and then uh we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since
my family we're pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um
as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away and
um but my immediate family like you know my fiancee and my daughter like we're close and it's great
<laughter>
i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience 
yeah 
i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like
just being away from it all that's that's good too
well i went to new zealand uh not too long ago and i had <ha>
stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius 'cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket  
uh i learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak
and um i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they had a lot of lamb oh and their seafood <seaf> seafood i can't eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is <sigh> it was so good
and ice cream was good too and uh the people were really really nice they it was a very special time for me to go there it was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back 
<laughter> yes it was
some of my best qualities um
energetic uh very personable uh intelligent
i am easy to get along with i work pretty hard
and i'm very slow to getting upset about things 
no 
no
no
mm it's fairly easy 
<laughter> uh i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have
lack of sleep but once i get some sleep in me i'm okay
mm fine 
no no no changes no
scrubbed_entry
um
you know he would say that i'm pretty funny um lax about a lot of things uh i enjoy life as much as i possibly can
um good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help
<laughter> just waking up in the morning <laughter> it's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good
i love laughing ugh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee 'cause she has a great laugh then
that puts me in a good mood
hmm
thank you 
scrubbed_entry
and that's what i wanna do i definitely wanna get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so he's been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble
um he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging     
oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend 
yeah 
<laughter> yes it is 
wow there's so many uh 
scrubbed_entry
had uh these bag of m and m's and we had went to a play
and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are you just they don't know how to you know they say they don't like somebody but you know
anyway but we got these m and m's and while the it was dark we start throwing m and m's and hitting 'em in the head with the m and m's and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial
to get
scrubbed_entry
so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime
and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days 
oh man you name it uh i love scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it wanna get back into it like traveling
uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it
that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so
that's about it hanging out with family 
anything i regret hmm <deep breath> you know what i think i <laughter> i probably regret
not
going up to will smith when i had the chance 
yeah uh will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and
i didn't meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him  
advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago
i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more 
really happy 
hmm
really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house
i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago 
yeah 
<sigh> let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and
i didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and i'm i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good
shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights
oh really 
alright well what was your name again 
ah ellie 
goodbye
