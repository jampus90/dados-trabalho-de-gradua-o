value
yeah 
so so <sigh>
nebraska 
uh work
i've been coming here off and on for years but officially moved here couple years ago 
um 
some good days some bad days i i guess i've gotten as used to it as i'm gonna be i don't know if that makes sense but 
um <sigh>
accessibility to to different things um
as compared to nebraska um
you know more opportunities to do different things and and explore different things 
areas of interest
uh the crime um 
attitude <laughter> um 
uh lack of lack of uh 
uh work ethic lack of uh 
kindness in people um cut-throat 
yeah 
i used to
quite a bit 
uh sense of freedom 
the uh the adventure 
um okay 
you want me to tell you about a trip <laughter>
uh egypt 
i 
yeah 
uh i went with my mother and some family friends we went on an eight day cruise down the nile
saw all the uh pyramids in giza
um just it was just a incredible adventure just to get away from everything and everybody and and uh close friends and just have a great time 
yeah 
um not really at all 
um just uh uh have history of um
abuse and and neglect and uh just
not a real functional family dysfunctional is is definitely a keyword in our family so 
thank you
um
no not really i'm talked about it a lot before um so 
i'm okay with it 
<sigh> um <sigh>
<laughter>
it's really hard to say i haven't had very good uh
uh very positive role models um
um 
ask me the question again 
<sigh>
well maybe at best my mother 
but uh she's a she's also been a negative uh aspect of my life but um 
uh
yeah i guess i can't really identify anybody who's been a real real positive influence in my life 
um the the trips that i've been on 
um i used to 
work out i used to do yoga i used to um 
i used to meditate
i used to exercise and i used to um
i used to do a lot of things lately um i find it uh hard to relax i don't have the same uh 
the same outlets that i did before
the same uh
i <ss> i i don't pursue them as much anymore i guess i'm
i've lost my motivation or something i'm depressed about it you know i guess there it is right there 
um
pretty good
i i is temper as far as getting to the point of uh
uh physicality i don't ever that um 
uh but i stand my ground and um
but i can control my temper i i i never lose control really  
um <sigh> the last time 
uh probably 
um as recently as you know 
in the last month or so i maybe argued with um 
uh an acquaintance over um 
uh
<laughter> uh i don't know i i have to come back to that question 
no
no
yes
um 
well officially october of last year but i've i think i've been depressed longer than that but officially october of last year 
um 
actually i was uh being treated for other medical issues and
um
my depression was notable to the doctors so
yeah 
yeah 
um 
well i've never been suicidal but just to just to just in i i just often have thought um 
eh
that i don't have much reason to to live i used to think i had a purpose and such but
um i don't really have anybody in my life um 
who i think cares enough about me uh 
that i really <rea> if i was even dead uh so
um i've kind of lost myself 
and um i used to that used to be enough 
that i was um enough to uh 
you know to to have purpuse in my life but um 
i've lost quite a bit of that 
motivation <motiv> yeah 
well i'm trying to pull it together i'm trying to um 
<sigh> get back a sense of me 
i get inspired every once in awhile but um overall i just don't seem to be making much progress 
yeah 
i wouldn't really call it therapy i don't have a therapist per se i have a
a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me
and nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues 
um i
uh huh 
did you say that sucks
eh 
okay 
and uh yeah 
um overwhelmed preoccupied um 
just uh trying to stay alive stay on top of things 
no
uh 
easy when i can i don't um 
yeah when i if i get a chance to fall asleep i don't have any problem with it 
um even more
distracted and uh um 
um even more 
uh lackluster i guess is the word 
whatever
uh if i had a best friend um <sigh>
i don't know um <sigh>
he maybe lot of positive adjectives before but now just you know just uh
some people say i should be proud 'cause i'm surviving a hard time or some people think that uh 
i'm a a loser 
<laughter> so
um
i don't know <sigh> maybe um 
a survivor
uh persistent um
um well i used to be proud of my career and um 
kinda giving back to people giving back to society um 'cause i was given 
a lot it felt like um <sigh>
so i'm just proud to uh 
i don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest i i've um
it uh i don't know <sigh>
<laughter> psychology
and um 
well initially yeah 
um no not really per se although my current career involves a lot of uh 
psychology a lot of um 
uh the aspects i don't know what i'm trying to say um 
it's a part <p> it's a part of it but it's not the center of it 
um well i guess if my career is still going i'm in uh nursing but um
i've been sick lately and with depression and other healthcare problems i 
uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income 
and i'm starting the process of that 'cause i'm not working  
very
<sigh> educating people um making a difference i mean i used to i had i've had my dream jobs
i've had my dream jobs i don't uh 
i don't know what the future will hold for for uh work but um 
something i suppose working with people again
health uh helping in some way 
um no but lately with the depression more so at times
i used to say that i never regretted anything 'cause i would make the best decision of all things in front of me but um 
i just wish there were times then that um 
the choices that i would have were 
<laughter>
were better 'cause some choices that i seem to have made or were made for me have um made my world kind of shitty  
for lack of a better word shitty 
what i don't understand 
<sigh> 
to be strong to um believe in myself 
to remember that i've survived a lot of things and i will survive this too  
to get up off my ass and move
to um <sigh>
to have confidence
faith 
um <sigh>
i just murphy's law has kicked my ass  
so much you know i just uh 
it it seems like when i've tried to make my world better i just keep getting knocked down um
so
it it's almost like i'm
i don't wanna give up but um every time i try and move forward i get knocked back and it gets gets exhausting 
and i don't have any support system really nobody
not really 
<sigh>
um 
loyal
um
hardworking 
um 
dependable 
um 
uh capable
um well at least i used to be
uh 
intelligent 
comtemplative um eh uh
deep
not a superficial person um 
yeah i guess those are some of them 
many years ago 
um i used to have a lot of confidence i used to be
pretty dynamic person i used to be people would <wou> say <s> used to say that i was the most centered person that they knew
and i used to
help people and i'm now in their shoes and i don't seem to be able to help myself 
<sigh> 
<sigh> 
i can't think of anything
right now
<laughter> i can't think of really anything right now 
i don't do much anything for fun anymore i used to however um go to movies and and entertainment venues and travel
go to dinner with friends do things um
but lately i don't i don't really have any pursuits  
a good day a happy day a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong 
basically 
<laughter> 
mhm
yeah 
bye
