value
i'm doing good um
from los angeles california
um the cool weather the beaches the people the schools 
um child development
yes
to be a teacher for special education
it's not hard 'cause i love to work with children
yes
dishonesty maybe
um
like if a guy like especially when it comes to relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal
my mom i wanna say my mom
um very close we talk every day
very close even though i don't live with them i try to see them as much as i can
uh it's okay <laughter>
it's it's good
it's
yes i do 
um they're they're friendly it's just that they're very quiet
'cause i'm not used to that environment
it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine I just wish it was a little bit it could've been better so yeah 
yes <laughter> 
um i had a different option to live with somebody else
and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with so I kinda regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever 
that's fine
how do i know who
i
yeah <laughter>
there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head
um
um
maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe 
that really gets me mad
mm yes 
because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah
yeah
wow
i hardly ever argue with somebody <laughter>
yeah
oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago
uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all
um
just her getting into grown folks' business and
it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said
and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter> 
and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people
that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that
yeah so but i mean we're fine now
so that's good
yeah
to not 
believe people so easily
so gullible to not be so gullible
i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um
yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances 
so
yeah
when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um  when i was sixteen about six years ago
yeah <laughter>
yeah i mean yeah i guess it was <laughter>
no i really want to though
um
trying new things seeing new views of the world um trying the different type of foods um seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there i guess
um
yeah i plan to go to the bahamas next year
i plan to do a lot of traveling next year actually
so
yeah
it's pretty good
eh somewhat
i'm tired <laughter> and i kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot
yeah
it's my fault though
um probably today
yeah
well i fell asleep late so <laughter> it's my fault
um no i feel pretty happy right now
mhm
no
no
no
very friendly and funny
talkative
um through high school 
we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week i'll try to see them at least every few months
mm they're everywhere <laughter> um yeah
no comment on that
they're more smarter they are learning more stuff than we learned back in the day they are learning they're very progressing but when it comes to technology they're not outside they're always on the computer on their phones they don't play outside no more they don't care about nature or the little things in life they just yeah but when it comes to their mentality they argue smarter 'cause the schools are getting better i ain't gonna lie so 
when what happened
i was just
okay
um last weekend i guess
right now
um 
what did i do
um being with my boyfriend makes me really happy so i was just hanging out with him last weekend and i never really get to see him that much so yeah  
'cause he works i have school different schedules
it's not that bad <laughter>
um he's my boyfriend i've been knowing for what about six months now 
we met through a mutual friend um 
in l_a i guess
okay
you're welcome
bye
