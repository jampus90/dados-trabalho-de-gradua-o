value
i'm fine how about yourself 
i'm from los angeles california
what part 
okay 
um all my family's here friends
a mixture of people and a lot of things to do
early childhood education
no not right now but i would love to get back into it
love working with kids seeing them smile
um
guess it goes back to when i was a kid uh i like being happy and playful so i guess it just transferred into my adult life
working with kids as a school teacher or in that capacity
yeah it is but if it's a passion of yours it'll always be fun
i'm very close
sometimes too close
um i have four sisters and one brother on my mom's side and on my dad i have
six brothers and four sisters and we're all getting intertwined together so so that's why i say we're too close sometimes
no
i have a lot of friends to interact with and uh we're always doing different things so that's why i say i'm not
curse
<laughter>
just let it out
a couple days ago my nephew
didn't call me back
um kinda mad 'cause i had set aside some time to spend with him and he just blew it off and didn't call me back
yeah i know
mm i'm okay
when my mother passed
uh it's been about
five years now to the day
so
it's it's getting better
time makes it easier
a lot
'cause there's a lot of things that make me think about her in a daily basis
anything uh driving by a particular
restaurant that she likes uh watching different t_v shows
just anything that could trigger a a memory
of my mom
yesterday
uh think about the good times and
i don't stay in that place too long just
go ahead and think about it and move on
mm not officially but i think i might be depressed
well
i mean since my mom passed it's been kinda rough
and then um
job situation is not stable here in california so that has a lot to do with it as well so
yeah it is but
kinda sort of kinda just to myself
reserved 
mm not really
it's pretty easy
grumpy irritable
fidgety
just a big ball of nerves 
uh what do you mean
uh i guess so yeah i like to travel
meeting new people
different locations scenery
uh different opportunities to try something new in a new location
uh just came back from memphis about three weeks ago
go and see family and friends uh it was pretty nice got a chance to
see um
something new
change <cha> change of scenery
wow
stick to the plan and don't
veer off to the left or right just go straight ahead
um 
just different circumstances in life that
gradually pushed me towards the left and the right
every day
uh a few relationships not staying in school
um
missing out on great opportunities with employers
um funny
loyal
spontaneous
life of the party
grew up together in the same community
went to school together high school friends
uh my big sister michelle
uh my friend troy
um
i mean there's others but those two uh no matter good or bad they're always
in my corner for me
thank you
yesterday <yester> yesterday celebrated a birthday
oh it was just a little small intimate
setting 
cooked a a meal had family and friends over
listened to music watched movie talked
about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one union
so it was just a nice evening
thank you
bye bye
