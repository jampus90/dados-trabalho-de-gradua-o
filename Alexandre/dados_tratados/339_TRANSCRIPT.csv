value
yes
um i'm okay
i was born in san bernardino california 
yes
um i'm staying with a sister in north hollywood
um she makes it as comfortable as possible
uh i love the weather
and the entertainment and the public transportation
um it's very difficult to find full time employment 
and some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the south 'cause i lived in the south before
um
those are the only two things
no i don't
i was an english major in college
i haven't finished yes i am
um i'd like to be a recording singer
yes
um i've always loved to sing from the time that i was a child 
at times
um when i'm alone i
am um extremely
<sigh> i guess i would say um
inter minded like i um have a lot of thoughts and i keep them to myself
<clears throat> 
so
if i'm in that mode then i don't really
um interact with people but i can also interact with people if i change modes
um i just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago
and
last week on thursday no on tuesday
um 
usually i
just try to um
remain quiet
and listen to the situation if it's a person or if it's a situation <clears throat> that i'm dealing with myself that's annoying
i try to um think of alternate ways that would make the situation better 
um come up with alternate plans so i won't get annoyed
um
pretty good
um
mm i may have had an argument a few weeks ago
um just about timeliness like meeting on time and showing up on time
and it was actually last
um monday
yeah mhm
no
um to just be cautious of people's intentions
and to listen really well 'cause people usually tell you what their intentions are without even um realizing <re> realizing it 
um a good listener patient
um
fun loving
generous
um
depressed sometimes
um 
but generally a good person
no i have not
yes
um within a year and a half ago
um i just knew that
i often thought about situations that um happened in the past and
kinda blamed the situation for my future
and um
um
certain
settings
um if i 
um see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when i was younger when things happened and changed my future plans
so i um try to i used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time
but now i feel like i um
just handle things better as far as
um
being in the similar settings with similar people i just
i um handle those things better
i do
um i like to believe that it does
i
don't worry as much
um it's just allowed me to
know that actually speaking about the issues
um
relieves me of the tension of um
holding them inside so
that's how it's helped me
at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um
it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring 
um if i'm able to um communicate about them with a certain individual
it um relieves me of the stress of
of uh trying to figure out everything alone and often times um by speaking about the issues it um
allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be be better just because i'm hearing myself speak of the issue 
um i was diagnosed with depression and um my doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist
um i am
it depends um if i'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do
i often try to plan things and if i'm planning things it affects my sleep i might wake up in the middle of the night so
sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't
irritable um
very <v> just very irritable
um i was feeling anxious but now i'm calmer
um today i don't but i have in the past week
um because i was in the midst of um searching for a a
stable <s> a stable place to live
and um
it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so
i was becoming anxious 
thank you
yes
um 
maybe in october
um well my mother first came she came to visit me in october and when she first got here we had a good time
for the first couple days um so i was happy to see her i hadn't seen her in over a year

um i'm proud that i'm able to um 
adjust to different situations
um the older i've gotten the more adaptable i am to <t> in different environments in different situations
and um i've learned how to be more resourceful so i'm proud of that
um
i'm sorry
oh
my dad and uh my sister she's positive 'cause she's finished her master's degree um
my mom sometime um my best friend is very positive 'cause she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it so that's an inspiration 
um
