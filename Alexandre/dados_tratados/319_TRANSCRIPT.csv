value

los angeles
um
well <laughter> that's a good question
um i like the familiarity with everything i know where everything is in the city
mm
that's all i can say right now
so spread out so hard to get places 
is there anything else
my dream job
i don't think there is a dream job
um
for me no there isn't one
mm
i'm uh sort of unemployed right now
<sigh> so am i
<cough>
mm that's true
<sniffle> i started i studied urban planning
well um
i think this um school shooting thing and uh the n_r_a seeming to not wanna budge on this gun control issue thing
that's it
mm
um i try to remove myself from that situation that's annoying me <sniffle> 
i've gotten better over the years um
most of the time i just try to um you know walk away or you know control my emotions in terms of
you know just walking away
mm just watch t_v now
hmm
i would say my children being born
well i have four children um each birth was speical and um <sniffle>
you know it was a unique experience each time
well it's a lot easier now because they're all adults um
but you know it was challenging
um i would say seeing your children grow up to be successful
and exceeding your expectations
you worry all the time you worry for 'em
you know now i'm not around them as much and i certainly worry about 'em
that i saw my children 
oh about a week ago
i'm usually
pretty happy when i see 'em
you know i have interest
yeah
<sigh>
mm
my girlfriend and
insignificant
no
around l_a maybe but that's about it 
<cough> excuse me
why don't i travel
i don't have the funds to do that anymore
or the health
no
no
yes
mm i'd say about a year
um recognizing that there were some things in me that
that were wrong
i knew that there was something wrong 'cause i wasn't myself
well you know i was
always tired and
not excited about things anymore and
kinda lethargic you know laying around and
just not feeling myself 
mm about the same
yes i do once a month
yeah i do i do
well it's you know it's you know i see a psychologist and um
we talk about things um i don't really wanna elaborate in detail but you know it's it i seem to think that it's helpful 
well i i think um 
that's a hard question let's move on please
irritable
cranky 
yeah it is
<sigh> ooh that's a good question it's been awhile i'd say
year and a half maybe
hmm
well there's been a lot going on in my life you know i just lost my parent my dad my last parent
just a lot of stuff going on so
i'll leave it at that
hmm
well i still like sports you know and
um watching a good game or something is
usually puts me in a good mood particularly if my team wins you know i like u_s_c
um i have a nephew that's um freshman football player at u_s_c
and uh i've been a trojan football fan for forty years so
yeah
hmm
well i you know i think i i listen well and um
you know i'm
pretty much honest and
straightforward
that's a good question i don't know you would have to ask her
definitely my mother
but she's deceased now she's been deceased ten years but she was definitely
positive influence my entire life
no i have many regrets too many to name and number
but um you know it's you know you have the the benefit of hindsight and yeah i have a lot of regrets 
hmm
to listen to the older people in my life
the people who cared about me the people who only interest was to guide me in the right direction 
like i said my kids i'm very proud of 'em
sure my pleasure
bye
