about <bout> one to two years ago
i was feeling down <d> uh down and i was not interested in things that i was <wa> that i was normally interested in 
and uh you know i was sort of withdrawn and um
the it was sh i was not able to focus on my things so
i thought maybe i should go see a doctor and i ended up doing that
uh no
mm
xxx i lost appetite i was not sleeping well and
i i had difficulty um concentrating you know and
focusing and
uh i was not getting uh my assignments done on time uh these <the> these were some of the problems
i been feeling good
but
uh
no i don't
i started doing yoga and uh you know i've been doing that for about a year and
that's uh and meditation and that's helped a lot
uh it's just that uh you know when i was diagnosed with uh depression i thought i shouldn't be taking any medication for it
and i was looking at uh uh other ways to get over the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and
uh you know i got influenced by them
uh it's a little difficult but uh of late i've been able to sleep uh within half an hour 
there are days when it takes almost one two hours to uh go to sleep
are they what can you repeat that
uh no
i just uh you know uh
just switch off the light and uh you know keep tossing around and
uh
try to focus on things uh that makes me uh feel good
and this and that
um about <bout> three days ago
what am i proud of
uh i was in i i was among the top two percent in my m_b_a class and
um
and when i used to run my business i designed a product um
that was uh working really well
and uh i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful for my business
uh
my my
i'm thinking my friends would describe me as uh very friendly very easy to get along with 
uh very focused
uh very intelligent 
and a good cook
um
albert einstein
uh
i mean some <so> some of some of some of his theories um
you know it
obviously it involves <inv> it involves a lot of deep thinking and uh the the first few times i read about him about his uh
uh theories
uh i had difficulty in um um really understanding that
and uh that you know we it
i mean when's when there when there are things that i really try to understand and i i'm not able to
i and uh you know there are there are the type of people i admire
listen to other people
uh it's diverse um and i like the the entertainment industry 
and uh
i like uh
yeah the fact that there are more women uh than men here
<laughter>
um
uh there are certain areas where only spanish <spa> uh where only spanish is spoken uh you know i would like uh for all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english 
so that everybody can participate
um
in l_a
um
i mean like i
some of the things the political leaders uh do really makes me mad
uh uh sometimes i think they're wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing 
and um
you know these <th> these guys don't get things done and you know i feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry
uh
yeah
i mean the first four years of uh
obama administration i'd i think it was wasted because
uh if the
if congress
had acted together
uh eh got things done then uh you know we would <wou>
mm maybe we could have uh you know uh made it much more difficult for china to catch up with us
and you know the fact that china's able to do things and get things done much faster
and these people still um you know uh argue and uh
you know find <fi> uh find faults with each other and not get things done
um you know they don't seem to realize that you know uh you know the clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done
um
i mean like you know uh <laughter>
one thing that comes to my mind is well you know i made a lot of money while uh you know once in los angeles uh
and
you know i thought it happened during christmas some ten years ago
and uh that that made me very happy
good music good food
uh
i mean the eh
a party with friends that i like
and uh
and
you know i also like cooking and i enjoy cooking with groups in groups
uh those are things that really put me in a good mood
um
i'm very clean
um
i listen to people
and i empathize
uh try to solve their problems
uh
and i'm hoping they think i'm you know uh my advices and recommendations are
uh
worth um their time
