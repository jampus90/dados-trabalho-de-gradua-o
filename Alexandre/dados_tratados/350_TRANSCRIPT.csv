value
yes 
i'm doing fine thank you 
originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi 
yes 
i didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents 
<laughter>
uh when i was two years old 
<laughter> yes i was i was a toddler 
yes i like to travel and i travel a lot 
um being around new environments and new people uh different things 
<cough>
um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa
in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people 
a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way  
i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget
<laughter> 
i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students 
uh not currently no
well right now i um tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher 
mhm
wow
anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so
yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that   
um 
occasionally yes <laughter>
um <clears throat> 
i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know  
mm
well 
i don't know i read um i just started meditation 
mm try to breathe and calm down <laughter>
yeah 
some things that make me really mad
um 
mistreatment of children 
abuse of children 
um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can
control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all 
oh i'm fine i can totally <to> in at controlling my temper i think so i don't have a yeah   
the last time i argued with someone 
was um 
i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um
it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so <laughter> 
yeah 
<laughter>
this is cool
uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day 
there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences 
well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her 
because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children 
and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to  
you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to 
you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible  
no i have not 
no
i have 
um well i was diagnosed um
within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months 
well
um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling
and not knowing um
you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling 
there were a lot of symptoms um 
um
you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight
um i couldn't sleep a lot
and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um 
felt sad sometimes 
like i wanted to cry a lot 
i've been feeling okay
um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so
i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get  
out and do more things 
um 
no no it's no no i haven't 
not any different from
before what i was experiencing before 
no 
mm
well mm i was receiving um 
uh i guess psychotherapy and um
i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda 
got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while 
uh sometimes 
i do 
yes it is
it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep
i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind
that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep
mhm
um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps
other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping 
it
tired <laughter> 
yeah mostly uh tired um
kinda confused 
i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um  
last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays 
uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me
and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um
that's about it 
how would my best friend describe me probably as um 
quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious 
um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and
they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or
um easy to talk to um
that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them 
<laughter> 
um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff 
to just 
relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people
because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you
are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their 
their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just
believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be 
yeah 
um really enjoyed working with um well 
okay
a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball
um being the first to attend college in my family
and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so 
uh i'm most proud of being able to 
have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and
help someone else improve and better themself as well  
goodbye
