um i argued with my mom and sister yesterday it was just something stupid over like
my sister is sitting was sitting in the front seat and she's a kid and it's like i'm i should be in the front seat so i just asked her to sit in the back and of course they start like yelling and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter>

thanks 
my grandma she's always giving me encouragement and um she's a therapist a licensed therapist so she's always you know made it really really um 
easy for me to have someone to talk to and i could always go to her

uh i love horses and nature that's the biggest thing that i love and it just made me so happy and so relaxed so that was a memorable experience <laughter>   
um caring
very caring always there to talk to um i don't judge i never judge i'm never cranky i'm never i never ever get like angry at anybody else just like my family you know but

um things that put me in a good mood like uh music nature
um i like to cook a lot i like to cook you know for my family talking puts me in a really good mood i love meeting new people meeting new people puts me in the best mood
uh it's not easy um it's hard um sometimes it's it's really hard um  
i don't usually sleep well so um
yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly 
um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories
um just you know
thinking too much <laughter>
um i don't know um i think just uh 
stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it <laughter> 
um i just try to stay positive i try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better
um  
i just i try to call somebody and talk to them if i have trouble like my grandma 
yeah 
thanks
when i don't sleep well um well i start to like cry a lot and i start to get really irritable
um i get really depressed it makes me not feel well at all i get very uh it just is really really bad if i don't get sleep yeah 
yeah 
thanks
yes
i was diagnosed um three years ago 
uh i just i didn't really know what was going on then i realized okay well they just diagnosed that and um
i was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that 
yeah 
yeah it's hard 
um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um
i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i
um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah 
oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so i'm trying to walk more that helps 
thanks
um yeah i have depression um yeah 
um it helps yeah it actually does help me a lot um i currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's kind of a mix-up but yeah it really really helps me 
um i noticed that i've had less flashbacks and um
i've been more relaxed i guess and um
yeah just you know trying to keep more occupied yeah it helps 
um the last time i felt really happy um
i guess um
i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter> 
um most proud of uh
well <sigh> um
i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um 
i 
think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like
you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help
but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um
they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that 
oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um
i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um
a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that 
wow um i would've told myself to
um
i guess the advice i would've given myself was to 
try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess
yeah
um
well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but
i just try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better 
for fun um i like to go to the mall that's a lot fun i like to go to the mall i like to go out with my grandma
we go places go shopping i love shopping and um i like to go
