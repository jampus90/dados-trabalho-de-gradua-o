lately not very easy
no just lately
uh
well my wife left like three weeks ago and after that i haven't been able to sleep
uh
i don't know i just bury me head in stuff
i don't know i just do stuff
i try to keep my mind off of it like do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything
i don't have i never went to therapy
wait no i did go to therapy
like three four years ago
'cause i went to a separate therapist
but then i went to a
a thing where i they they did a bunch of uh cognitive tests <te> tests and memory tests and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time like i get depressed and it last for months on end
yeah uh
to be honest i don't know
i think it's more about like you focusing on yourself and like
i don't know i don't know how to explain that it's like you have to figure out things within yourself you don't need someone else to talk to
well originally when i went to a therapist i was court ordered now i wanna go to therapy for my anger management though
i don't know what the fuck
<laughter>
i mean my wife left like three weeks ago so yes
<laughter>
uh it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done so yeah
well considering i'm only nineteen if i could go back nineteen years i would say not to fuck up
and let myself get depressed about certain things that would've drove away my wife
and not to be angry
yeah driving away my wife <laughter>
yes many many things every day <d> every day
well i could've not broken stuff
and i could've uh
stopped uh
like i was basically blocking out the external universe and i was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that i don't focus on the real life i was basically escaping and so in that sense i wasn't paying attention to her and that's basically why she left
i mean that and being angry
'cause like
both contributed their own proportion
their own portion
earlier today
uh
i mean i feel really happy all the time and then it just like goes away it's like back and forth like one day i'll one second i'll be really happy and then another second i'll be really sad 'cause i'll think about something again and it's like i gotta keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think and
i don't really know how to explain it it's just something you feel
no
<laughter> you need better programming
<laughter>
<laughter>
uh
silly
uh i'm creative
uh uh potential of intelligence 
i'm charming i'm loving
at some points i'm all of those things
some points i'm not
doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around
my hip hop
i mean kid travelier
you need better programming
<laughter> kid travelier is my friend 
to be a hip hop artist 
i don't know i just thought it one day
