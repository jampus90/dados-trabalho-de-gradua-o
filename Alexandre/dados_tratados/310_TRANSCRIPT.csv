<laughter>
uh not very often so once every five years or so
so
oh yeah sure absolutely yeah 
uh depends on what it is that i'm annoyed by
could be anything depends
<laughter> it depends on whether it's uh
a something or a someone you know eh if it's a someone i mean i'm i don't
i don't uh i don't get physical towards them but i mean i've <clears throat> depends on what they've done to piss me off i mean i'm certainly not above
uh shouting at them for whatever reason so
just depends
uh in terms of lashing out at other people physically i don't do that but in order to let off some aggressions if if need be i'll i'm not above you know
punching a wall or punching something nearby i just i mean i'm not trying to
you know just as long as it doesn't physically hurt me but but i i you know just get some steam let off let off some steam well that's normal for me
uh <sigh> face to face uh <sigh> 
mm
can't remember it's been a long time
eh
but i mean eh but i argue about
with people online about stupid shit yeah and that's that's normal shit but as far as like face to face you know it's been a long time and
