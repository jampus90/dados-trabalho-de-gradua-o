value
hello
sure
good a little tired
indianapolis indiana 
uh i'm a singer
i like singing 
um diversity my girlfriend's uh
from taiwan so it's dealing with different cultures 
the traffic
the uh
crazy people
it's um 
seems hard to get anything really accomplished
<laughter>
it took me about six months just to figure out the directions
twenty eight years ago
a long time
haven't been there in about eight or ten years
well
uh i don't like my brothers so i don't want to hang around them
i started my girlfriend uh we did about uh just went back got back from orlando and uh she likes to travel so
meeting new people seeing new places uh helps me to get out of l_a and get a different perspective
uh i just did the avatar seminar which is like a
raise your consciousness and um cleaned out the crap in your head 
<laughter>
um
yeah i feel better uh been having a lot of psychic attack and
it's uh i'm psychic so it's very hard to deal with it 
<laughter>
um
well um
there's more to life than what you see so um
a lot of things are in other dimensions and other places so have to deal with not only the emotions but people uh direct energy at you
um
well have to do a lot of clearing and grounding and
stay true to yourself
i am both
well i'm introverted because i like to spend time by myself
and i'm extroverted 'cause i like to meet new people uh used to be totally an introvert 
watch movies watch t_v read uh do crosswords i'm a singer sing
write music i'm writing a novel
um it's sort of like the matrix
um well i wrote the first twenty pages pretty quick
so um
uh now i'm expanding it
i get inspiration uh it was actually a dream and then i wrote down the dream and now it's becoming uh i could probably turn it into a movie
<laughter>
yeah
uh when people don't respect me that's the number one
no i just that my brothers they don't respect me they don't really
um
you know i want to love my family and but i don't want to hang around my brothers so it's a conflict
exactly
pretty good i only get mad about once a year
um my girlfriend about two or three months ago
she was wanting me to do something and i said no <yawn> and
i don't know
yeah
she's my girlfriend i know her for about a year now
pretty close
um
one time i
was singing and
scrubbed_entry
and i was singing to an audience and that was great
um
well i'm looking into ways to expand my consciousness so that i can have more money and more abundance in my life
so i can uh
have my own house and uh live in my own creative space 
<sniffle>
uh singing i'm a singer so let's see like unforgettable so uh that's what i like to do
no
no
no
oh that's the hard part i uh i don't 
i don't know maybe it's because when i was
uh a kid my brothers beat me up and
i don't feel totally rested in myself or in my life so
uh
i feel like uh <sniffle>
i don't feel totally safe
yeah
um
a little irritable
but i have been sleeping better since i met my girlfriend so it's not totally bad
my what
behavior what
i don't know
um well i feel more positive i did the seminar and uh
so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain <sniffle> and be more positive about life
um
well did a lot of exercises to uh
reduce my stress and lot of my stress comes from uh judging myself and other people 
yeah you could say that
<laughter>
uh
well
<sniffle> mm
mm
i don't know it's hard
<yawn> hard to deal with sometimes i mean sometimes a lot much too critical for my own good
uh <sniffle> 
well
watching t_v gets up but
<yawn> uh lately i just been feeling like i need to
um
have less judgement and more fun 
uh well i did that seminar
um
it was about a week ago i think 
uh well i went to that seminar i got there i was able to
take off work and <yawn> <sniffle> be in a different environment 'cause my job is stressful and <sniffle>
my life is stressful so
uh <sniffle> i was able to take a break which is great
uh i'd say i'm outgoing fun smart
uh
but i mean in l_a people in l_a they don't want to most of them don't want to spend time with you
i don't know if that's because of me or l_a
<laughter>
uh
that i spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward
avoid it yeah
watching t_v or going to see movies or <sniffle> trying not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem
uh well a little bit i haven't paid my bills a lot i still owe money <sniffle> so um
it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy <proph> prophecy 
uh stop criticizing and
start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen 
uh my girlfriend's been really helpful
<yawn> well she's funny and <sniffle> she loves me and cares about <abo> about me and 
uh
<laughter> yeah
um singer and i'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and
uh
i'm a good listener 
uh well i've written about four or five books i uh
my voice i think would be number one 'cause when i started i didn't have much of a singing voice but now i do
okay bye
bye
