oh it's very cold there in the winter and our summers are very short
it was very easy i accustom pretty quick
no not very much anymore
um <sigh> i don't have much family in the united states and it's pretty expensive to go back home so i only go every couple of years
meeting different people different places different customs
uh well we just recently went to um san francisco same custom and everything but the city was very different and i enjoyed it
uh i took general education and child development
right now i work part time for an independent auto repair shop
um <sigh> just working with people
talking to people
um
no
um i'm shy sometimes so i stay to myself a lot
uh walk along the beach uh bike riding
arrogant people
um i try not to get angry but sometimes i do um try to <sigh> learn i'm learning to walk away from things but sometimes people provoke you
um
i'm getting better i'd say seventy five percent under control
oh about a month ago <sigh> um with my daughter and her finances
it's really hard you don't like arguing with your children
i have two girls one's twenty three and one's twenty six one lives in louisiana and one lives here
now that they're older yes
um satisfaction of giving love to someone else
worry
well unfortunately when i was young my sister was kidnapped so when my children were growing up i worried about them a lot and i didn't let them do things a lot on their own
oh now it's easy 'cause they're grown and they live on their own so it's a lot easier now but i you still worry even though they're grown
i'm sorry what did you say
oh my goodness they're spoiled rotten they have everything
um <sigh> waking up when my kids were younger on christmas day i loved it
no
yes
uh it's been exactly two years and two months
um loneliness depression um
especially after i didn't have any family members left in the united states so
um i went to a counselor and then to group therapy
yes
i mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your um
your likes your dislikes your problems and sometimes somebody else is sharing <sh> going through the same thing you are and you can share <sh> you know share what you're going through and what can help make it better
um it's affected me a lot it's helped me cope with things it's nice to have somebody else to talk to
yes i didn't want to admit it but after awhile and feeling depressed for so long i knew i had to do something
pretty good
um no just getting more positive better
yes
it's not
it's about fifty fifty some nights i sleep good and some nights i don't
<laughter> 
um 
just lack <l> lack of energy the next day 
it's hard especially if you get two nights in a row of no sleep
