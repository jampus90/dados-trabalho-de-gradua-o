uh lately it's been pretty tough i guess because i've been staying up so late but

sluggish and tired all day if i don't sleep well all day i'm just laying around 
no not too much 
mm no <laughter>
oh stay focused and listen to the adults <laughter> 
yeah 
i mean it's self-explanatory i could've just listened to parents or other adults that tried to steer you in the right way and
you know you're being a stubborn kid at that uh at those ages so it's like
what what are you talking about i this is my life i can do what i want i don't have to listen to you but now i see that <laughter> what they were telling me was correct     
um
hilarious
<laughter> 
pretty close 
uh both my parents mother and father
mm recently what did i do
um new year's eve party i had i had the time of my life it was so fun
uh this new year's eve i went to a party at a friend's house in baldwin hills area
he had it at a a pretty nice house it's a three story house and it was like
three hundred and fifty people in there it was pretty fun but it was also not that fun because there was so many people and you couldn't really move so
that was the only downfall but besides that i brought my new year in great with tons of friends and
that's how it's supposed to be done 
um i'm generally in a good mood every day i mean waking up puts me in a good mood i i guess you could say that but 
um
i don't know a good a good meal <laughter> 
<makes clicking sounds with mouth> ooh one of my most memorable experiences were probably
uh when i was younger i was in the boy scouts and we used to go camping all the time and one year we went to  
yellowstone or yosemite one of those places and we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge and
of course being from the city i'm like a mountain biking i can ride a mountain bike but
once we got in the real mountains on got on real mountain bikes
i gained a new respect for the mountain bikers it was pretty it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about forty five miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense and that was i'll i'll never forget that  
mm i don't know that's a tough one to to answer what am i most proud of 
i don't know honestly 
bye
