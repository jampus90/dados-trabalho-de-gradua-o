value
yes
<clears throat>
okay
um new york
um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry 
uh yes
i'm self-employed
um to become a music producer
um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter>
um
to pursue a job
uh when um
about a year ago last february
it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast
um i think i've been there twice in the past year
no i'm more of a creature of habit
um yes
uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things
um
<laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs
um <clears throat>
probably um people being insensitive <insen> um
not very um very nice to me or um
seeing injustices or um
i think that's about it <laughter>
um pretty good
you know sometimes <so>
um
probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that
yeah it does <laughter>
pretty close
um my best friend so i um
oh just one of my friends
um
i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually
um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion 
um
um probably spending time with my family
in new york
very close
um
my sister and my brother
um i don't know they're just great people
and i love them a lot and
they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me
um
probably
um
i guess loyal um
sensitive um <laughter> 
i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter>
no
no <clears throat> 
yes
gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago
um
i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff
um not currently i i did about like six months ago
um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and
xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change
it's okay <laughter>
um yes i do actually um 
when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do
um
i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um
when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um   
also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself
so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat>
um
feeling hopeless all the time
not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues 
um
having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life 
um
sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me 
um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal
to record things
<clears throat> 
um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter> 
um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it
um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult
um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat>
um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um
that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter>
um probably christmas time when i was with my family 
um just really happy and um
feeling like everything was alright in my life 
having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself
um
probably you know um
let's see that's a hard question
i think probably
i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um 
uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um
i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter> 
um
um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um
one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter> 
um
don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um
i think that's it <laughter>
um
i don't know
that's a good question
probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um 
so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher
um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out
for about six years so seven years 
yeah it was awesome
um
i was really kind of like um 
reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat>
so uh and then i went a worked in a um
mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so
it found like a good niche for me
<laughter> okay
no problem <laughter>
goodbye <laughter>
