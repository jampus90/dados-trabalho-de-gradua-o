um well i'm a football recruiter so i travel
uh all around the world to to sign different football players for our sports management company 
uh
um just the independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it's great
i i remember traveling to uh
scrubbed_entry
and take him to clubs and this and that and we're not that type of organization
<laughter> yeah
um dishonesty i <sigh> i don't like when people are are dishonest um that really really really bothers me and not true not honest not real um
that that upsets me a lot
um
i tend to just
try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in a room by myself and just try to clear my head <he> my head  
um i'm okay with it at times um uh but i can defintely be better
oh um
i argued <argu> argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about um
our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way and i think
i wanna raise her kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so i think discipline <disci> discipline is a big key and the key is life and she she she was raised a little differently
um
i don't know just
angry upset you know when you're in a argument that's what you feel so
you do and say things that 
that
that bother you and you just you go on with it 
um
yeah uh a little bit
<sigh> um i don't know it just <sigh>
i eh just the way i feel i don't know i can't really say just the way i feel
um a little
a little
um
i don't know just um
realness
um
honesty
the truth just being straight out front
um i'm pretty close um
i'm pretty close with my family
oh whole nother subject just
they're raised different um
i i think society <so> society's gonna become even wilder with <wi> the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they're doing everything we we
they live and everything's inflated so much to where
um
it it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand i think kids these days to a certain extent are are are much wilder than i was and
and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know just
education-wise it's just i think it's just tough times for kids and and the way they act uh it's
it's it's ridiculous to me
um
i definitely like to watch sports uh i i like to gamble i i like to travel i like to skate
um
i like
kind of like uh a a a guy that likes to see different sights and go different places uh like different <difft> i'm a big movie person so i like going to theatres stuff like that
um
i'm actually living it um
i i always wanted to be in in some kinda sports industry and that's what i'm doing now i just uh my goal was to get a little higher in the ladder and and own my own sports management company um but i'm doing pretty well for myself so
i am happy
yeah
no
no
no
um it's okay i'd say it's pretty easy
irritated
tired
<sigh>
i don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile
couple weeks ago
huh what did you say
no not really
um i think he would describe me as a stand up guy i try to be um um a good loyal friend and
and an adult i think he would describe me like that 
uh school went to school grew up together i've been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life 
yeah
uh very close me our our uh my friends and i are very close uh um we pretty much do a lot together still at this age 
uh i'm honest um i'm loyal very loyal um
i am a hard worker i think i am um
to a certain extent i'm just not the average guy i'm pretty much i'm a different different breed i just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy 
i don't know just how what i was raised and how uh my dad was kinda different uh and and and he didn't go with the in crowd and i think i learned that from him a lot and and it's just it it's it's um
kind of
the same path i took
um yes a lot of things i regret um
i regret
a lot of decisions in my life
um yeah one um
i actually
let a a lady in my life go years ago that i thought was my soulmate and 
we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that that break i i started dating somebody else and i told her i'ma go my way and she go her way i think that was a big
a bad decision a very bad decision
yeah totally i think i could've took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of uh
<sigh> being so upset and moving forward
uh just upset um i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so
uh mm i
i need to think a little more when i'm upset
uh i don't know just
experience and time
being you know making making up for your mistakes and and and and um
being better about
different decisions after you made the mistakes
um <sigh>
think a little harder about situations <situatio> uh about situations and and things and the decisions <dec> decisions that you make uh
think a lot longer and harder before you make 'em and i think the outcome would been a little different today
um
my grandmother she's always been a um a a positive influence uh she's a great black woman um with a old school um
ways of living so um i think i i i've added that to my life she's a great woman
scrubbed_entry

um i was a pretty good player i was a pretty good athlete growing up um i was one of the top
scrubbed_entry
and uh that started a future in in athletics and that's what i wanted to do so i accomplished my goals so at the time it was a great a great thing and it still is a great thing it's a great accomplishment in my life  
um <sigh>
accomplishments being able to if i or if i'm 
have a goal or
or something i'm supposed to do that week or that day and i accomplishment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and i the way i'm supposed to do it in a in a timely fashion that always puts me in a good mood
um
being a positive role model right now um for younger kids that's in um our sports academy program i i think as i got older
the thought process and um the way i look at life has totally changed and
i think i a lot of kids can look up to me that i deal with now and say you know that's somebody that
that is is a positive <po> a positive influence in my life
