value
yes
fine how about you
here
yes
the weather
weather mainly
yeah the main <ma> the weather
sorry
not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people
okay i'm cutting you off
not as much as i used to
um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt
i don't
i don't enjoy traveling
uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly
yes i am actually
right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire
impressive
professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that
where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest
you're actually pretty good at this
<sigh> i there's a lot of people
the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know
he's the first one who taught me that
school was not about a grade but about learning
okay
i'm pretty good i think
i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about
he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good
um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all
fairly close um
i see them pretty 
pretty often parents i see a couple times a week
they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that
and my brother i see 
same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also
interesting
yes
because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading
and not talking to anybody that's introverted
i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot
i try to at least
i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing
um
and that's about it i think
<deep breath>
bad parenting
basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just 
do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion
<sigh>
um
i guess
scrubbed_entry
um
scrubbed_entry
scrubbed_entry
thank you
i don't really have a best friend
introverted remember
i'm biased obviously
but they are
i'm really good in math
i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is
it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think
and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway
that type of thing
when i a good workout 
doing well in video games small little things like that
um
what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood
thank you
right now
it's the fact that
research that i did i did make it this far
research wise that's all
that's all
interesting um
when you start off in school
you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
and
you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it
and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you
as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
okay
um
a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class
thank you
yes briefly 
many years ago <ag> yes
i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that 
um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen
i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two
yes
not really
i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much
graduate school
in physics
no
nope
it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before
if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard
i guess moderately 
thank you
yes
it's okay
i'm probably like i am now
normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function
no
maybe slightly
sorry
no
yes
yes i have changes in my thoughts
um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that
what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school
i understand
okay
i agree
no not really
probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um
twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen
um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well
even though it's not perfect now i think i'm doing really well personally
thank you
same here
goodbye
