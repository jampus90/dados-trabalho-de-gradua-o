value
yes
quite well
feel good
los angeles california here
mhm
one of the few
um native born los angelinos
i uh
home school my ten year old son and uh
i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years
mhm
so that's a full time job huh
uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um
for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit
uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and
it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine
which is near the uh
galilee
and in a place called uh uh
i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but
uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um
a house for that welcomes
um christian uh
pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims
um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the 
it's totally ancient but um
most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um
live
no
not at all
just don't
i you know all my life i've always been
open and and uh willing to socialize and
i remember my younger brother always
um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody
just because i enjoy learning about other people
um
most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family
um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then
um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband
and just relax that's what we do and you know
'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so
i like to watch crime dramas
um
really mad probably not a lot um
i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room
almost ever
so that that gets me angry but um
in terms of like really um
getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like
little things that my children do to you know
especially my oldest child who's twenty one
you know he can be confrontational so
other than that nothing gets me like really angry
haven't i haven't haven't felt that
um contributing to society helping uh
helping
to raise um responsible people i guess um
and of course the love and the affection and the um
the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go
i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children
are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults
so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and
all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh
challenging discussions and that sort of thing
so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and
you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff
the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven
um
you're never not a parent
you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first
with my first child um
thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot
um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but
i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and
um
it it it uh
in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom
mhm
always
i'm sorry
i didn't get what you said
um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church
um and my faith
uh but also my husband he's been a really um
he's kind of he's very
like logical thinking and very you know grounded
so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always
we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out
it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life
um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper
um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like
rarely do i have outbursts um
i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up
so with you know like my husband and i don't
rarely fight like have
arguments that are
yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens
because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something
i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up
um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he
um
you know he thinks he knows everything
he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality 
and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and
you know as life goes on he'll learn more
he's very confident and very self uh
self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct
and
he still has a lot of learning to do that's all
mhm
it is it can be mhm
i think um
that many of them are um
spoiled and live in an environment of uh
of instant gratification
um
which i think is gonna be
um detrimental to the to the future of this country
but um
you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i
i have um hope that um
they will
i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics
and uh
hopefully our our the next generation and the
the generations after that
can maintain that um
that standard of living i don't know if it's possible
mm as
loving nurturing um
funny
we laugh a lot and um
caring honest
things that uh
i mean my best i have 
well actually my best friend is
it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um
we
i
for some years
took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close
have a very close relationship with them still do
and so um i'm considered the fourth sister
so i would say that those are my best friends and and um
we love each other very much
it's a good relationship
no
no
yes
most
mostly
mm minorly depression it was more anxiety
um probably um
um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally
like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but
um
other than that i i you know so
depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control
um but now it's under control so
i have a great
huh
um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic
um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance 
in my brain
i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um
we had a 
good family gatherings
a little stressed because um
we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um
and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of
some renovation and some
to help and some obviously moving around
and so we're in the throws of that and um
so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because
really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties
so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them
um
not easy usually
all of my life i think i've always
i mean i'm not i've always had um
at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night
um
to go to the bathroom basically
and uh
other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning
then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then
go back to bed and
go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are
have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors
yeah sometimes it does
mm
probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know
but um
i think overall probably the same
my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful
they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know
they may pitch in a little bit more
uh not really
not not no
not really
not anything significant
huh
um actually yes i do
i do feel like therapy is useful
um well uh we had a situation with my daughter
um
she also suffers from anxiety and
um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish
a group with her that was a six month um
uh
group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a 
it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers
and um
it's been really good it's been
very helpful it's just all about
how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental
um strategies to keep your uh keep you from
your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know
in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so
um
that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter
and it's been really um
really informational and really helpful i think
oh my daughter was um she was
in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and
we knew it and um
we acted on it that's all
um
like
really joyful and happy i would say probably
when
probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan
 uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful
um and it was it happened that our anniversary was
we left on our anniversary day flew to israel
so it was right at the same time
it was beautiful
very meaningful
and other than that i would say you know like
uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and
you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three
on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so
um
um that's an interesting question i would say
um
once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm
have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or
errands to run once i get them done
i feel like a sense of accomplishment
you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um
you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things
you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know
so i think that would be you know for me the most um
most recent
um
way of feeling good and feeling you know
like feeling accomplished
dream job hm
i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula
and um
yeah and um
so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends
and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in
the birth the bringing of new life into this world so
i would say that's probably
was my was a dream job and i didn't know it
i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um
was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore
actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed
but um
i like i said i do it for family members
um
i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident
she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children
and um
i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends
and
her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave
i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth
which is a whole different experience
so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery
but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you
even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like
so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood
um about fifteen years ago
'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old
so um
yeah
and i've been
um
well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but
uh and you know also like
for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business
and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me
so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the
um
the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby
i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter] 
it was in the middle of the night she was like 
two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter]
so um
it went really fast but other than that
you know um
yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do
um
in all of life or in your job
uh probably my my own birth
i mean my the birth of my own children
um
like there's an extreme
sense of joy excitement relief
because of course you're out of the pain
and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know
going forward from there but it's
it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome
after you give birth
and i have experienced both ways i've done both um
natural and
my last child was via c_section so i've had both
both um experiences
um
i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little
psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny
and um she
she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was
born very quickly after he broke the water and oof
my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble
because i only had like two contractions after that
my daughter was born in the bed
so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but
um i'm sure they weren't happy
to fill out a lot of paper work after that
so
now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago
um
ten or twenty years ago i was probably more
not as um
relaxed not as um
like i feel now at my age that um
i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about
uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what
you know
you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care
you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever
so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that
you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
what are you most proud of in your life
most proud of um
probably my family my my husband and my
my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've
we're an in tact family that
um
my kids see every day how
their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and
they um
they actually express
gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family
so i would say that's probably it
um
probably the
one of my best qualities is
uh
being able to listen to people and being able to um
not be judgmental um
through the years i've had a 
a lot of experience with um
people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and
it's just taught me that um
everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems
and um i don't think i'm better than someone else
if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough
okay
okay
goodbye
