value
yes
very well 
new york 
just turn the volume up a little bit 
<laughter>
uh for a change
yeah it's good 
i wanted <wa> i wanted to
i wanted to see what los angeles was about 
um probably took a year or two 
uh you know being away from my family being away from
what i was used to in new york the neighborhoods the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here
uh the weather 
you can't beat the weather it's generally always nice it's not too hot it's not too cold
uh it's creative i do like uh you know movies 
uh like the beach 
the traffic
it's a lot of traffic
uh 
some of the sometimes i think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places 
i was a history major 
no
uh i do uh demonstrations in really <rea>
uh high-end supermarkets
uh to be a screenwriter 
that's one of the reasons why i came to los angeles 
um it's hard 'cause i don't always maintain uh focus and motivation
i let other things distract me
<laughter> 
uh i was uh i've always been interested in films ever since i was a child
and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination  
uh i've in the last
probably
almost ten years i've traveled more than i had in the past <pa> well i've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around
so yes
seeing new places and seeing uh people that are different than i am seeing how they live 
and taking in the sights 
uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever went on um on the safari and  
just going out in a jeep and seeing <laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible  
oh yeah that's one the great experiences of my life
and i also got to uh 
a a place in egypt uh at the end of that trip
um called uh 
sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that
egypt would but it was just amazing i went <we> i didn't go scuba diving i went uh snorkeling 
what do i do to relax uh i i do i like to listen to music
i like to uh helping watching movies helps me relax 'cause it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind
i do meditate every day
um i like to take walks in nature that's always calming
especially down by the uh the ocean 
uh
what i it depends <laughter> sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times
uh 
i'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something i've recently learned how to do 
which is very helpful 
and also since i meditate it doesn't i don't get annoyed at things as easily as i did in the past
some things that makes me really mad 
i guess uh think of injustice 
in the world or done to people when
uh
it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along 
um 
and and make the world better
<laughter> uh last night i went to a movie screening 
of a independent film and i didn't think it was done very well it's not so much that we had a fun argument 
about uh about the movie 
so that was like you know that just happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind 
<laughter>
is there anything i regret yeah there's there are have been opportunities in my life
that i wished i had
uh taken them and pursued them 
uh certain jobs
you know when i first got to los angeles i had an opportunity to uh 
become a grip
and uh and i i probably should've pursued that 
how did i decide it to do that i don't really understand the questions
take advantage of every opportunity that came my way 
to always <alway> i think saying yes 
uh to any opportunity is is very important and no matter  
how you feel you know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you wanna do 
no
no
no but i've been depressed in my life 
uh for the most part i've i've been feeling good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh
i think you know sometimes if i if i allow <allo> allow a
regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but i can you know usually get out if it pretty quickly 
uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh 
an an opportunity um how do i explain it eh there 
sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is one way i that i if i had made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different 
um 
not really i mean i i feel 
pretty much the same
what got me to seek help for <laughter> let's come back to that 
um i've well okay well it generally talking to someone has helped when i did do that 
uh pretty easy i don't have a problem sleeping 
uh 
usually i'm grumpy <laughter> so if i don't sleep well uh you know i feel tired and irritable  
uh 
how would my best friend describe me
that's a good question um friendly <f> well i'm friendly <f> i'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little bit secretive
um i would probably that i should be
they'd like to see me more accomplished and uh and uh attaining my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier  
i think um 
it it it's tough it depends
sometimes i'm very introverted 'cause i do like to write so that takes it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i come out of that uh i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself with
as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation and my mood 
my best qualities um
i think i'm caring i think i'm intelligent 
uh i think i'm funny i'm outgoing
um
i have a likeable personality 
you know people have said that 
um i'm engaging but not uh oppressive or overly engaging there's a sort of a cool detachment 
um
and creative intuitive 
<laughter> yes <laughter> 
last time i felt really happy 
i don't know i woke up this morning i was pretty happy 
i had breakfast i was happy 
sun was shining 
<laughter> 
um 
i think that like i said going to kenya 
was a memorable experience i do remember <remem> scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience i just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean 
you know
and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back 
um
almost beyond you know because <beca> almost beyond like  
human in a way just more in touch with like everything the universe
yeah it would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but 
what am i most proud of in my life 
i think i've uh
helped
<pft> people 
uh and
sometimes when they were in crisis
um you know i've written some screenplays <scr> screenplays
um 
i've had some good relationships 
um good relationships just you know being connected with someone else you know 
spending time with them
and connecting 
on emotional and 
<laughter> physical and 
mental levels 
um what it could be a song that i hear on the radio
uh it could be uh
lot of times looking forward to something you know if i'm gonna go to a movie go bowling
hang out with people
um
you know looking at work
and and going to work and feeling productive can put me in it puts me in a good mood
you're welcome
bye bye
