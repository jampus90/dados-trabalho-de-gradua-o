value
yeah
i'm doing okay
how are you doing
i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley
i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just
not
as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a
like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other
uh
don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean
there's not that much i don't like
i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that
yes
right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera
so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to
performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily
so it's actually a pretty good gig
and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that
do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the 
because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter>
so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life
sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people
but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family  
don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know
i'd rather keep to myself
uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so
but like
thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and
you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together 
but it's
somewhat close
mostly i sing or i read or i write or
just
hang out and try to
clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just
clear everything and see what starts coming back in
and
sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things
um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever
works but
mostly in my free time i create things
i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um
i mean my idea of
like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip
and i like to travel more um
i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel
seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change 
i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of 
where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that
but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>
<laughter> <clears throat>
um
let's see
xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line
um my cousin and i would take what we call
exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just  
sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off
so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight
just small short trips that
aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how
um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas 
so close to home but not
but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that
kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway
so i i like i like doing that
the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that
we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am
and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live
so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas
and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda
i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there
and we came back and was
you know
an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so
it was kind of an interesting
uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back  
and
i actually
like to see people who are
strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate
or what have you
so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason
you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it
just that kinda really just makes me mad
when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either  
you know verbally just
cutting 'em with a quip or
you know
i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody
but i'll try to you know
if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works 
not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to
get them to leave me alone
um
so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction
and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if 
it's is trouble it's usually trouble that
it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of 
so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it
uh the last time i argued with somebody
like
person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my
uh the last thing i can think of was
i
argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia
and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a
i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature
but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her 
and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us
because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process 
but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like
i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that
it
brings you
a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened
when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it 
and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it
but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her
yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually
and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care
but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad
but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore
so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do
i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that
so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's
a dual effort it's very much a dual effort
but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like
a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but
lively discussion <laughter>
you know than debate
meh
it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever
and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you
so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy
but you deal with it and you you move on
uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother
'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually
gave me a lot of confidence
and but were realistic about it
so i mean i think i have sort of a
realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over
and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life
and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed  
i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions
now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home
my focus was to get her home
so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year
eating just horrible foods when i did eat
so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick 
and i'm wondering well if i didn't
if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded
would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em
and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she 
uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and
her health insurance provider missed that
so she wound up having
sort of this whole
catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down
she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke
and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her
and i know
there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her
if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have
oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's
my desire to take responsibility
for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really
direct them into my own vision because they're their own
individual beings
and they can't you know
be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be
but i still have you know my ideals
and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too 
fit into my life
in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings
and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well
is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs
and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but 
it's still
kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it
um
ten or twenty years ago
probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she
got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her
and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside 
the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years
so
i think i i probably would've done that
um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate
your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family
to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself   
ten years ago <laughter>
no
no
no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know
and i mean it's not
i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances
and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment
and of it gets <ge>
um
after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know
if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't
but
how could i convince myself of that
um two weeks after she died i wound up with
pulmonary embolisms
in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if
you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um
i mean i wound up having to take more medication
because of that
uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to
get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like
the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so
that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore 
so
and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just
you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now
and it
it's been
a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up
just stay in bed and sleep all day you know
but then
realizing that
when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well
they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies
i took that responsibility of doing it for them
so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't
they didn't you know so
they eh they actually got me up and
and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them
if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been
you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably 
and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for 
for me i mean for me making selfish decisions  
so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is
to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care  
as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but
i have a family to look after now 
so i have to go out and do things 
you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know  
but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm  
been working on on a balance of the two
very <laughter> but it's worth it
i mean 
it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter> 
but keeping
a residence down paying bills things like that 
it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that 
and i and and i know that 
but 
it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up 
but then 
it's like well what's the alternative 
i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life 
'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna 
be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever 
and i wouldn't get anything done 
uh very 
anxious and nervous and i mean what if 
i don't find 
enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um 
you know what what if i can't  
keep
a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but 
what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs 
and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that 
but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in 
so that's actually 
a source of 
anxiety 
but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it 
but i i i know it it's a cycle
and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is
the fundamental thing i need to take of here 
i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what
is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue 
and so 
figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit
but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again 
mm i'll have to 
uh 
figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it  
you get over it pretty quickly you get through it 
the last time i felt really happy
i don't know
zz
um
i 
huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me 
because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda
eh in the middle
um
really like overjoyously happy i don't know 
i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened
i don't know you don't know 
perceptions of other people i mean 
probably as somebody who 
oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know 
handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that  
at all
and it's a it
probably that i can think on my feet and
i'm not afraid to 
hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done 
um that 
and i can do it creatively and i try to 
strive for balance 
probably 
probably the best things about me <laughter> 
that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not 
um
you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to 
who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got
a career that she 
it's more of a job that she fell into 
'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer 
and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time  
but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and
she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda
stole all the money from her business so she lost her business  
and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early 
she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it  
and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it 
and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is 
yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can 
be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me 
people i actually like in my life and 
be happy with that 
and i see a lot of people who aren't 
and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that 
and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now
thank you <laughter>
okay 
thank you <laughter>
goodbye
