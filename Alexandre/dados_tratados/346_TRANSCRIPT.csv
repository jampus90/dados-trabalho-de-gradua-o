value
yes 
i'm okay 
here in los angeles 
there's a lot of things to do i love the beach 
um i love the i love that it's sunny all the time 
um the amount of people 
um 
that's really about it the amount of people 
just a little 
i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things 
um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months 
um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york 
um and it was extremely uh snowy and um 
i didn't <didn> was in a position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small town  
so um 
i uh 
uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really 
it wasn't really much to it <laughter> 
yeah 
um 
both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert 
um 
i really enjoy doing things by myself 
um 
i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends
and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot 
um 
probably outgoing creative
um 
talented 
um fun trustworthy 
um 
i studied language um 
and um physics 
and um 
math
no i'm not 
i'm actually um
i'm um i'm trying to be an actress 
it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager 
scrubbed_entry
and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um 
so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing  
um so far um i just got picked up by an agent 
so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult 
but um 
i'm hoping 
hoping something it'll be fruitful  
um 
<sigh> i really don't haven't had too many 
um 
i guess my sister she's done really well 
um 
my boyfriend he's a 
he's a very positive human being 
um 
but um 
really i haven't had too many positive influences 
um 
i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything 
um they're kind of judgmental 
but um 
other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day 
um 
geez
um 
it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v
um and i read 
a lot um 
that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um 
yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax 
um 
it isn't 
um i tend to think a lot 
um about the things that stress me out 
um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um 
yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks 
um 
i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh 
has affected me throughout the years so um 
it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt   
um 
or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep 
but i uh <sigh>
i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me 
because of stuff that've happened to me 
so um 
i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well 
um 
tired 
i'm uh 
i'm moody i'm very sensitive 
um 
i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person 
um which really that's not me um 
i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just 
i'm just not a not a nice person to be around 
um 
i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um 
just to keep myself involved 
um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can 
um by running around and and and doing things 
so 
um it's difficult 
um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna 
i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh 
i make appointments to like for auditions or or um 
even to do this i um i i tend to uh 
just not 
like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways  
yes 
um i've been diagnosed for two instances 
um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago 
and then i was diagnosed again um in august
um 
the first time it was um 
i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um  
and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress 
um 
and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um 
and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore 
so i i figured um 
i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um 
not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated 
yeah 
it was 
i no <n> do not
um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um 
get out of my environment 
um
and uh 
and that seemed to help a lot 
um 
and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much 
um they just 
they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed 
um 
yeah so um 
yeah 
<sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  
um 
but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  
keeping myself busy 
um 
actually um 
i'm kind of
a couple days ago 
i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  
um but then i went back to 
being you know going back to feeling miserable 
so
um 
well i realized 
i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep 
and um 
i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky 
um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me 
and uh 
you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that 
and that made me really happy 
um 
yeah 
thank you <laughter>
oh geez
um 
i've had so many years of just 
just bad just a lot of bad 
that it there has it's been a long time 
since i've been proud of anything 
i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through 
um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've 
gotten rid of themselves a long time ago 
but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um 
there's gotta be a silver lining 
so 
um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh 
i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people 
and um 
and truthful and i still i still have drive in me 
yeah 
ugh <sigh> so much um 
my last marriage
um not getting out when i should have 
um 
and uh just
i regret a lot
<sigh>
um the any situation that would've had a red flag um 
eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work
and um 
no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um 
i i would tell myself um to um 
that it's not selfish 
to let go of a bad situation 
and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself 
so if
had i known that then had had i known that
then i i i probably would've done better in life
so 
yeah 
<sigh>
um
people who um 
when people are down on me for my faults 
um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um 
people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy
um
just anybody who picks on the little guy 
um 
you know people who don't care about the environment or animals
um 
i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be 
and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do 
and uh i that makes me mad 
<laughter> i vent <laughter> um 
yeah i tend to vent and then uh 
and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um
i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore
mm
i try not to get angry um 
because i have a really bad temper
and it um 
and it can get outta hand so um 
what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap
 um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind
and come back to it 
um 
it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um 
it was about um 
actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her 
and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um 
i was i was tired um i was it was late and um 
i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um 
and you <yo> <sigh>
it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person  
um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue 
mm kinda petty and stupid but 
at the time it it seemed 
it seemed uh 
viable 
um 
hmm
one of my most memorable experiences 
um 
god <go> i've had so many um 
maybe
it was um 
i don't know
um 
it was 
probably um 
graduating pharmacy school 
um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing 
uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent 
and um 
i uh 
i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um 
and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah 
yeah 
um 
i'm reliable 
um 
i um 
i'm talented 
um i
i'm a good listener
um 
i'm always there to help people 
um 
i tend to always try to do the right thing 
um 
sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but 
um 
and just 
i uh 
all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself
um 
yeah 
um 
going to comedy shows 
um 
just um 
having moments where you just laugh with people 
um 
sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood
uh 
i don't know
probably that's about it 
uh huh 
okay 
thank you 
bye
