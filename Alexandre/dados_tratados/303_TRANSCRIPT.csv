value
okay how 'bout yourself
here in california
yeah
oh well that it's big and broad there's a lot to do a lot of um
um job opportunities than other states
um pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here
traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis
sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology
no i'm actually an m_t_a bus operator
well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature
thanks
well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible 
what do you mean i'm sorry
okay
read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes
i'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time
well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated
no i'm pretty good at it now
maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today
i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but
my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family  
thank you
no <laughter>
um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home
well um
by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature
i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old
yeah i'm 'bout to be
well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time
yeah thank you
the hardest thing is
well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and
they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can
with my kids or just period
what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know
and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know
you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me 
thank you
happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so
i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week
thank you
hm
well the advice i would've gave myself
that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that
i probably would've
stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um
rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um
education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day
so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career
i'm not quite sure um
you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so 
yes
my oldest daughter
we had a argument because
just
the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through
and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation
and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know
hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or 
or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but
that just happened you know
i just told her i'm not
i'm sorry
very close
very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life
and I'll be telling
she's um
she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite
and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change
it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but
the ball is her court you know
i only can do so much
oh wow
i have my days um
since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like
<clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know
pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know  the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it'll help me
what am i like irritated tired um lazy
you know
feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep <laughter> get the rest that i need but <laughter>
i never thought about that
i just you know
'cause like i said you know everybody have their moments they do i never thought about that
hm
no
no
i don't really have a best friend but a person that i deal with and i used to work with um she would probably tell you that i'm very um outgoing a go getter
dependable responsible
i'm a um people person
i get along with others you know i'm kinda like
um
i leave a good a a good mark
whether i know you or not if you was to you know like 
like you and i now you know i um
you'd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that
thank you
well
i try to stay happy i'd rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what i mean
especially when i go to pick them up from school or their being hey mom you know that just kinda make my day
just them run up to me you know and be happy and excited you know what i mean 
thank you

goodbye
