um i like to talk to people too much
and
when i understand or i i know a lot about a subject i can go on and on about it and i'm interested in finding out about people if i'm sitting next to somebody i'll strike up a conversation with them just to find out who they are and
just um you know i'd i like to talk to people i enjoy it
i'm quiet
um
let's see rude people
um people that harm children and the elderly <el> elderly that makes me very angry
uh war
i control my temper
i i don't have a problem with that i just get quiet when i feel angry and i try to think before i act 
the last time i argued with someone was about a month ago
and it was with my daughter and um i was arguing with her over her therapy
she has cancer and um she wasn't telling me enough she wasn't giving me enough information and so that made me very angry i was frustrated and angry
yeah it was very hard
no <laughter>
watching your children fail when they're trying hard or seeing that they can hurt themselves and trying to prepare them for that when they won't listen to your advice
and they uh i feel like sometimes they need to trust me more
mhm
um the love of my children
yeah
uh when i was uh playing with my granddaughter and that was about a month ago
very excited and happy and just um all my cares were gone
i wasn't thinking about anything except for having fun with her so it was a good time
yeah it's the best <laughter>
no
yes
um it was over five years ago
i couldn't function
i couldn't drive i couldn't sleep i couldn't eat um at my i i couldn't do anything i was completely 
shut down
i felt like i felt like i was looking out a window and and life was going on outside that window and i was just stuck i behind the glass i i couldn't participate 
um i knew something wasn't right
but i
lately i've been feeling depressed
mhm
i haven't had a good night's sleep in

friendly
i think it's just horrible <laughter> 
um i feel that um
the children are so neglected today and it's not the fault of the parents i think that um
i think that we as a society we forgot that it takes a village to raise a child and
nobody wants to pitch in noone wants to help anymore noone's helping their neighbor and it's very sad
