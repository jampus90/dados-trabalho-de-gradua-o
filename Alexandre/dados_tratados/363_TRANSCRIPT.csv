value
<synch>
yes
good how are you
i am from los angeles
yes
um
it's uh center of everything eh you can get to all the places you need to go to uh eh without having to drive very far
um i like being in the city
well
being in l_a also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion
and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great
but
you know you live with that
um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um
after i finished college i um
uh pursued a career in retail operations
uh no i as a matter of fact i am not i kinda changed career
uh over the last four or five years so i'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business
um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business
i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge <knowl> a lot of knowledge um
in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company
yes i'm very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh
and it's very helpful
<laughter>
well my dream job is um
i'm basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh
independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs
and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do
and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so
i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be
mm
i'm not
well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm
probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean
when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um
obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself
oh sure you know i have um
uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to
yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me
um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um
if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it
actually um
my relaxation is um i'm currently um
living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work
take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know
um i'm not um
i'm not a
short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned
there's not there's not much to that
um
i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um
being very difficult to work with um
and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh
they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because
um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that
it does <laughter>
probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um
it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and
yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point
or it would it would kill him you know
um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i
i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run
it is
it was
um
well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated
and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together
and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so
she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old
and
and so she needs to
uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh
someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child
probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage
um as far as um
the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife
uh yeah i um
got caught up in a situation where
um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart
and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so
you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money
and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship
had to do with trust because um
it it was devastating to my wife
i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light
um i felt very guilty
and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life
no not at all
no not really no
i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no
no
not at all
no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um
after i had my heart attack a few years ago
um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before
so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that
the last time i felt really happy
um
probably when
i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack
and um
he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that
he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue
no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack
and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications
well i guess number one thing is uh
my physical being itself
i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight
um
just in general just be more healthier physically
and as far as mentally um just not
go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish
just one day at a time
you know i just uh
try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis
i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself
i do things to help myself
well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage
uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and
and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but
um
at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done
so i don't focus too much on the past
i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day
what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing
to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed
um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh
i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um
scrubbed_entry
you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately
probably
the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that
um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that
um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive
uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy
and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh
just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night
one day at a time
it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where
you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines
and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore
um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably
easygoing generous
um a nice person to be around
and um
you know
they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues
uh related to the gambling and the
my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know
well my ideal weekend starts off usually um
after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock
um i go to a local park and uh it's about
this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning
um
get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um
you know go home
um work in the yard a few hours
take a shower and relax and then
just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk
work out in the yard
watch t_v whatever just relax
that's how a weekend goes for me
and thank you
bye
