value
sure
uh
okay i guess not bad not good
so so
denver colorado
uh to pursue job opportunities
uh about two years ago
uh once or twice a year
uh i really like the sunshine
um all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do
that sort of thing
uh i hate the traffic
i wish the seasons were more distinct
and that everything costs a lot of money here
pretty easy
hmm
i'd say uh
people are rude
um
not having enough money
uh what else
mm just a lot of things are frustrating i guess
<cough>
i guess it depends on 
what i'm annoyed about like if it's at another person or about something i did or just life in general
uh
if somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop
is that what you're talking about
okay
uh so so not not as good as i'd like to be
uh
a few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time
uh pretty pissed off
taken advantage of
i like to go to the gym
uh hang out with friends read
write
that sort of thing
mm at times
uh because
sometimes i like to keep to myself and don't feel like showing a lot of outward emotion
i have a degree in in liberal arts majored in political science
no
i work uh in sales
hmm
to own uh
several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams
i guess if that's a job
uh
i used to live in mexico city that was pretty memorable
um let's see it was pretty different than anything i've ever experienced it was a lot of fun exposed to a lot of new things and new people 
uh
i was pretty young carefree good times
um not recently but i have in my life traveled quite a bit
um let's see
i went to london that was a lot of fun pretty cool city
little too expensive but definitely cool
of what just anything in life
um
let's see
uh boy that's a good question um
moving to l_a was pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to uh move here so that was memorable i would say
<sniffle>
<clears throat>
hmm
uh maybe like
six months ago
uh things were just going really well
didn't have much stress in my life
uh yeah i'm i'm
easier more easily irritated
and uh
yell more tired more
uh kind of down feeling down more
not as productive
uh yeah awhile ago
uh
hmm
mm don't know exactly it's been a few years but i still feel the same as i did when they diagnosed me so i assume i'm still depressed
um
well i just i'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems so i just thought
that would uh
be a good idea so i did it and and that's what i found out
oh yeah definitely
um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest 
<clears throat>
thanks
um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff
like out there like out of your head or whatever it it's uh it helps to destress i think
hmm
pretty girls
<laughter> 
<laughter>
um
i'm a good leader i'm really smart
uh
being able to
um
survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help 
yeah lots of stuff
um
just dumb mistakes i made when i was younger that
looking back now with what i know now i probably would not have made
um
i would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible
hmm
scrubbed_entry
he's always good for a
sort of pep talk but uh with a dose of reality he doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective
um
talented
and
i don't know good at stuff i'm good at a lot of stuff people seem to notice that i i guess nice good disposition funny
see you later
