value
sure 
good
chicago 
it's cold in chicago 
hmm
oh i think in ninety nineteen eighty nine actually 
oh very simple very easy 
oh weather of course and i'm so easily
located to san diego palm springs las vegas san francisco and things i like to do
smog of course is bad 
crime rate's higher than it should be
um 
and financial economic problems here 
every year thanksgiving 
very very much so we're a very big family 
yes i do very much in fact
i love flying on airplanes i love visiting new places i even like visiting different airports everyone's different 
ooh let's see 
i started off in
pre-med haha i ended up in uh physics
yes i am i teach <tea> i teach physics 
and math and higher level math 
well i enjoy working with kids 
i enjoy teaching my mother was a teacher uh my dad was a truant officer
and uh i've enjoyed it
keeps you young 
my dream job 
my dream job would be to be a judge 
yes
in in the uh 
youth court that would be fantastic but i should've thought of that sooner than now so i'm not gonna be able to do that 
no <laughter> not at all 
um i enjoy people being around people i'm very talkative at times uh 
i like to do a lot of things and i'm very social when i do them 
uh believe it or not i play bridge i play chess and i watch a good old old movie 
ooh
bad drivers 
uh bad laws 
politics often 
when i'm annoyed 
you know i really don't get annoyed that much i just let it go 
it's not worth the pain and problems they could cause
if i can't straighten out a problem let it go  
go somewhere else 
ooh
always my bridge partner but that's different uh as far as anything else i don't really argue with people
i i don't argue i don't like confrontation
my parents of course very very much so
um
i had great parents 
uh 
my mother uh my parents met at tuskegee
which is a black college and they always want me to go to a black college but of course i didn't wanna do that <laughter> uh i went to illinois so
they're a very positive role model for me there's certain things that i don't do today because of them i don't drink i don't curse i don't look down on people who do but i don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things um 
i love to drive i love to travel
and my dad used to always take us some place every weekend he was off we'd go somewhere 'cause we were in chicago indiana michigan some place in the area we'd go up to michigan and pick fruit or we got all our dogs from uh puppy farms in indiana that kinda thing
uh i had an uncle who lived in uh wisconsin who was a dairy farmer so my dad used to love to drive and i love to drive also 
mm
that's a hard one 
i've had a lot of great experiences
uh
i think the best one was uh we went for my anniversary we went to europe we went to paris and uh 
we rode the orient express
we went from we didn't go all the way to istanbul we went from london to venice and then flew back to paris uh   
that was probably the best experience i've ever had in my life i i've never really cared for europe because there's so much here in the united stated to do and so much in america and i had been to alaska and hawaii but we said we'd do something different and
we'd always wanted to go on the orient express and we did that expensive but phenomenal trip
gotta do it once it's a once trip not once in a lifetime just once
not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger 
but um
there are a lot of things we should've probably done we didn't do i wish i had gone to chicago <chica> we would always go to chicago on thanksgiving but i think we should've gone more than just on thanksgiving
my parents come here at around christmas time but i think we should've uh
done a lot more when it comes to that 
yes that's that's that's why it's a regret because it could've been avoided there's things we could've done and we were spending our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us    
i think that people <peop> most people
oh yes very definitely 
ooh 
that's a good question ten or twenty years ago 
i would've said um
don't take things too seriously but don't be too relaxed over 'em either
sometimes you can uh take things for granted never take anything for granted 
nothing's promised 
oh heaven forbid 
<laughter> no i have not <laughter>
no no 
no 
very very easy i really have no problem with that once in awhile if i uh am anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due then i get kind of uh anxious a little bit 
i don't like to be late uh i don't like to make mistakes so therefore i i do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that i have everything right 
tired 
i don't get irritable i think i just uh
lethargic maybe a little <litt> just a just a little bit 
very good i was up late last night so i'm kinda tired now but i i usually have no problems sleeping 
uh
and i get a good night's sleep 
mhm
no i have not 
um
no not at all i just came back off a christmas break <laughter> so i'm should be very relaxed now
ooh i have great kids 
i have a son at u_s_c
and i have a son at u_c_l_a 
and my daughter just got married 
so i'm i'm proud of my i'm really proud of my kids 
they're they're going to have a good life 
oh yes
um i enjoyed it i still enjoy it 
being a parent is forever <laughter> so 
uh <sigh> let's see 
taking care of someone else and getting started off to have a good life  
i think that that's rewarding
making sure everything is covered 
that needs to be covered with you kids whether it's their eating their sleeping their clothes they dress make sure they're content make sure they have no problems at school or home or uh that that they're safe
physically mentally spiritually everything
hmm
my best friend would say she has not changed since high school <laughter> uh
level-headed
but uh great sense of humor
relaxed i don't take things too seriously
ooh
i love the holidays i love christmas i love everything about it i love preparing the house for it i love baking cooking
especially baking i love experimenting with new recipes and so the last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here i felt fantastic
everything is is quiet i'm not at work i'm not stressed out in any way at all i have no projects due
that i have to think about anyway 
so uh christmas time holiday time 
really enjoyed recently well christmas of course we went to las vegas um
the twenty seventh of december that was fantastic <fantas> we only stayed for two days we had a really good time uh we saw a great show 
we had some great food
we drove there we don't usually drive i don't like to drive a lot but we drove there and just took our time
