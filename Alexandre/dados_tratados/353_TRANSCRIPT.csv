value
yes 
i'm okay 
um pennsylvania 
mhm
um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life
um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once
a year
um
definitely safer and um definitely a more um
well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here
um 
not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment 
no
um advertising communications 
um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment
um i wanna be an osteopathic physician 
um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who
helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live 
a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine 
um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast  
um sometimes 
um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and
eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups
um
eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings 
um i usually 
try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated 
um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset  
um <sigh> let's see
uh mm
i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case 
yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers  
i have no idea <laughter> 
um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um
i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people
um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em 
no
yes 
um just a few months ago about in the last six months 
um i was
experiencing 
mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't 
um
i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself 
um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um 
that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working  
um 
i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so
um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings
and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out
um
well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um 
and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and
i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that  
i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home   
um 
it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um
i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling 
i do 
um <sigh>
well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um
and i am more
cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts
um
and about my decisions as well
i'm not so
i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life  
um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours
but now i am um sleeping through the night again 
um i feel <f> groggy <sigh>
k i feel foggy and out of it um 
and just low kind of depressed 
mm
<sigh> it's um
i think it's been awhile 
um
working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um
spending time with my family
um
yeah just being outside enjoying nature
reading
um very close 
what is that 
um
scrubbed_entry
um
well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um
giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then 
my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um 
looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um
he's been very
uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and
and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or
um running errands without having a lot of anxiety 
um i'm most proud of 
the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um 
maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it
going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut 
um 
what advice would i what
uh
to
recklessly pursue your dreams um
that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and
and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted 
um 
let's see
uh <sigh>
well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um 
so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so
we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis
and cauliflower so just using preparing that
