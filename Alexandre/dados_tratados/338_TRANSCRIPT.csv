value
yes 
i'm doing fine 
i'm from los angeles california 
wow wonderful weather um
outdoor activities all the time
too crowded pollution 
the norm 
i studied child communications
um recently i just
i would say yes
preschool teacher 
well i've always worked with children ever since i was eighteen years old so i figured
doing something helping someone it doesn't pay well but you're investing in the future 
wow some job that i could get paid to be outside all day get paid well to be outside all day 
yes 
i'm kinda quiet but i also like i probably would say borderline i like outside activities but i mainly kinda do um activities probably by myself so yeah i would say i'm an introvert
slightly
uh wow just um maybe a racist or disrespectful person
i kinda shut down and and reevaluate how i am as a person how i'm coming off to other people i can't change anyone else's personality but i can work on my own  
i'm pretty good 
i usually don't argue with people i usually walk away i mean a argument doesn't settle anything 
wow it's a lot of things i regret but it's not anything that i can control probably the biggest regret was losing my mother 
thank you 
i was extremely close to my mother that was who i am as a person who made me as a person 
wow twenty ten years ago i would tell myself not to be so angry so 
upset all the time about things i can't control i would tell myself to relax and
not be so hard on myself 
i think that's pretty cool i think you should have different avenues to deal with different people  
<clears throat> no i have not 
no i have not 
yes 
um less than a month 
i realized i have to evaluate myself as a person so i can't really look to anyone else to help me unless i i start with myself
no i don't 
i feel like as a person as uh a individual i feel like i should be able to control things myself i feel like
to go seek out help is good for someone else it probably is very good for other people i've worked with that population of p_t_s_d um
veterans before so i know that it helps a lot of people but i don't feel like it's for me
it's not difficult at all i've always been like a loner someone who who tries to handle <ha> to handle my own problems and situations 
a little depressed but i think everyone is it has a little bit of sadness in them at some point  
day by day day by day i just started a exercise program so i'm trying to look at myself 
for the solution 
always known ever since i was a child things moved me differently than other kids so i felt like i was always different i felt like if i was gonna ever
understand me as a person then i would have to work on myself so yes 
um today i got to see my best friend after a long time so i mean happiness comes and goes but i felt happy today 
wow he would say really silly um 
but still when i'm around him i try to be happy i try to present a a a situation where we're both gonna be happy no one wants to be around a depressed person 
scrubbed_entry
wow
i mean on certain days everything could be my best quality but i would say um i'm loyal i'm dependable um 
i would just say i try to be there in the moment i'm not a person who who is really fat flashy <f> excuse me uh flashy or into materialistic things so i feel like i'm very grounded 
oh my mother
by far my sisters 
uh my mom was a school teacher which made me wanna become a school teacher and that's basically what i have been doing uh my sister has been at her job for forty years so i've always had a stable influence in my life 
wow i would say
just sitting on a sunny nice day talking to my mother i would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately  
wonderful 
wonderful 
i like to get out and play sports i play four or five different sports and um i like to go for a walk i like to ride my bike i like to get out and be active 
having such a wonderful mother i mean i have to keep going back to that subject because
we're introduced into this life and that's our first teacher that's our first teacher and it's gonna be our teacher for a very long time and uh i'm just very thankful i'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother
