value
yes
alright 
i was born in uh los angeles california 
uh well the weather and uh 
the fact that uh people aren't so obtrusive like on the east coast 
uh
just the uh the traffic and the
the smoggy weather 
i used to i'm unemployed now so i rarely go anywhere 
i have a b_s in uh business with a uh computer uh
option
i thought that the only place i could get a job with a business <bu> business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods so i took that i took business computer methods option 
oh i'd probably be like uh
a professional sports player or an actor something something that you enjoy doing 
i like to uh
ride my bike i like to watch sporting events now i can't afford to go to them
so i pretty much watch on t_v 
i like to travel but like i say that i don't have money for that anymore 
that's alright 
uh <sigh> people who are chicken heads they get their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers you expect that from a family member
or or a friend but you know
especially with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in nineteen eighty four 
uh i don't do much
much different than i would otherwise 
uh and i've had many temper outbursts
uh 
i kinda argue with my aunt 
and it was because she was basically 
making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative
and uh it annoyed me greatly  
uh i'm kind of on the outs with my parents 
i'm kind of the black sheep 
oh uh i mean my mom's done the most to help me
she's done a lot
you know more than uh anybody by far
well i mean she's just 
i remember one time when i was in like thirteen i went with a friend of mine to see the crosby stills nash and young concert at the forum 
and she has seven kids and she picked me up at the sizzlers right across the street from the forum at uh eleven o'clock at night and i couldn't imagine
with all she had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did 
oh probably uh 
going down to the cape at the end of uh baja peninsula there's cabo san lucas
or taking <ta> photographing the bridalveil falls in yosemite 
uh it was probably the two most majestic seen <see> sights i've ever seen 
it was when i could afford to travel 
no
no
i was
diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in april of two thousand eleven   
and uh i took some lexapro but i stopped after one day i didn't wanna do it anymore 
no
because i didn't feel it was helpful i feel i was becoming a zombie 
yeah 
depressed about not having a job for over two years i lost my job in october two thousand and ten and except for
day you know jobs like this which i'm fortunate to get just you know daily things focus groups like that i haven't worked 
thank you 
especially when you're fifty six years old 
well mm
eh just uh it just the i guess the general feeling of hopelessness  
i get out on my bicycle a lot and walk or bike just four hours a day split about two hours each 
yeah good to get some
very easy 
'cause now i'm old when i was young i couldn't sleep more than six <s> four six hours a night 
because i'm restless 
no
but now that i'm old i i i sleep much more easily 
i pray before i go to sleep
and that's that's that's when i can't have any trouble sleeping i just pray
recite different prayers like the lord's prayer hail mary stuff like that and i'm able to fall off to sleep 
i don't know probably uh 
can't have any specific remembrances 
of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably
fifteen years ago 
well
i haven't really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh
made seventy five dollars on a job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play
the basically the relatives of people who had been in a in a
fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told 'em gave 'em the information i'm missing 
you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county
and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a 
not not hard it was just uh
just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually
missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera   
i don't have a best friend 
uh 
i'm uh very bright
i'm a
perfectionist at my job 
i'd say that's about it 
i got a business degree and i've never been a motivated person i went to school i went to
two state colleges and two
junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution <con> contribution that i i made to my 
you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall 
yeah i regret you know 
alienating family members 
i would've uh 
basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs thinking <think> thinking that 
you know i could always get another one and not you know
basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now 
they've added locations but i burned bridges there so that's not possible 
thank you 
hasta luego
