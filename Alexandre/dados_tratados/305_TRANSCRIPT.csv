value
i'm doing alright
uh originally i'm from california
uh born in glendale
i'm not too happy with it
uh just unemployed at the moment but uh
actively seeking uh
uh doing what i'm supposed to be doing uh there are some uh 
some prospects there but hopefully i'll learn something today
yeah
well i have one it's a girlfriend so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing
pardon me
um we're pretty close
uh i met her last year and uh
we've been through some
troubling times but uh we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel
uh
the troubling times
uh
i would
let me see uh
well
i had uh gotten a d_u_i last year and uh lost my job i'm a truck driver by trade so 
uh that kinda
threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off
and uh I couldn't um
i haven't really uh
found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking
and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh
so
i'm choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work it's hard to find work with uh without going to school 
and uh so
but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully i'll get that job i should have that job actually so
um
but i'm starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little
my dream job would be probably forestry service
out in the wilderness yeah
i like being alone
pardon me
well
you know i have a a lot of for animals i'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like  being i don't like people too much
uh so being outdoors and uh i've always enjoyed being outdoors that's how i like being a truck driver i've traveled the world
i don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office i'm of a a
outdoors type of guy so
uh one of my trips would be uh
i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge 
uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh
i went there to work for 
uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus 
so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of americans  'cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed 
so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i
i enjoyed myself you know
through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me 
all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh 
you know it's been great
uh
probably
um one some of the things i like about l_a
there's not a lot that i like about l_a but
um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um
the uh huge uh
um
different different people you know different uh
different ethnics of uh people here you know uh
i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what it's like there 
traffic's atrocious
you know
traffic <laughter>
uh ignorance uh
being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people
um
that's about it
dishonesty
pardon me
uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh
you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh
people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes
you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that
yeah big time
what do i do when i'm annoyed
um
probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um
well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis  
and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek
uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions
um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh 
um i'm pretty honest with
i'm open and honest about any anything and everything
and uh
what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just
you know didn't like that at all
pardon me
um
i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh
just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh
i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest 
um
i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so
you know and if you're lying about something well
you just you're always having to cover up uh
more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just
don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship
can't do nothing about it
uh fun i
like going to the beach uh
i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting 
and i'm pretty gifted at that and um
uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing
uh haven't gone in a while though
and uh
i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um
pick out some of those uh
astronomy uh stars up up there and um 
i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um
sunshine just
those i like
uh most memorable experiences um
good or bad
uh
most memorable experiences
uh probably uh
playing with lions and tigers uh
uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle
uh
uh just enjoying myself
i know
not
uh i don't have much family as it is
uh
at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh 
but i'm not close to i have uh 
three brothers one sister
and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings
i speak with one brother
uh quite a bit um
my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not  you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me
i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece
some of my nephews and that's about it
have i done anything to avoid it
um
to avoid them
uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so
um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh
going on a year um
you know i uh
depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um
so just
wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts 
so 
or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over
so
i don't
lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired
uh lately i have been probably about the last few months
um
tired <laughter>
um i you know
if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work
um
and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head
and so
you know um
i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me
and uh
so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about
you know um money um
you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or
mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that 
how do i what
how do i cope with them
um
i just
try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um
i just do it's uh
i'm more of a guy that just
you know it may take me a moment to
to um
say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews
uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um
back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me
if what has gotten me in trouble
my mood swing i mean
um
yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh
uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are
uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh 
on uh how to interview how to uh
how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh
i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who 
who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done 
uh
i've done uh
i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and 
and try to uh work on
the issues that were bothering me so um
you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school
and uh
anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities 
pardon me
i still didn't hear you
that
people have been deceitful
can you repeat that one more time
alright
uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism
um
it's tough if you don't you know um
i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um
again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know
um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and 
and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um
you know
some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and
so i just try to cope with things uh
um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years
actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um
whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it  
um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still 
uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just
and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people
um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so
um
but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um
but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um
you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus
that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way 
so i just let it go
i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad 
did i have a problem before i got out
uh
well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people 
um
i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um 
a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago 
uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older
kind of uh
you know makes it work you know
me me dealing with life so
pardon me
uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while
uh recently
and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um
a lot of people may not understand that but uh
a therapist is
i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh
people you know uh
uh
other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like
you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others
uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who
will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know
but it's good to have
yeah
well i don't go anymore uh so um
i kinda miss it you know like i said uh
uh
i miss it a lot actually but uh
it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will
um well monetary reasons and uh
you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um 
you know money situation's not that great right now so
how does my friends describe me
um
they would probably describe me as uh
uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people
um
laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot
um
but uh
they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh 
uh
hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know
and uh so 
someone who has been a positive influence in my life
someone who's been um
someone who's been a positive influence in my life
uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh
with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh
uh german and um
they didn't
teach i don't know what he saw in me but
he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um
showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself 
and uh
sort of let me know that you know that there's nothing that i really can't accomplish if i put my mind to it
you know
yeah it was
you're welcome
bye <laughter>
