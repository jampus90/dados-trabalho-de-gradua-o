value
<laughter>
um moscow
um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college
 uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though
it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between
the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while
one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist
it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um
i guess pretty close
right now we're kinda distant
oh about the distant
okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks
'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room
and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of
we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move 
it's okay it'll get better
it depends with whom 
i'm
dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good
but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger
oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]
yeah
uh probably my best friend nicole
she's probably been we've been best friends for like
god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah
um
of
of what 
uh my friend nicole
um we met in french class freshman year of high school
we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then
mhm
um
uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking
staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography
um
just hanging out with friends i guess
whatever
uh
it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um
those kinds of
things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things
 i don't really discuss that with them
so i guess superficially close
but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess
mhm
uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again
i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant
and
uh
conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um
what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]
but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess
uh yesterday
and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money 
and so and
so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy
and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
about other people or about myself or angry
xxxx [laughter]
um
angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often
dang it
that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me
um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring
so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um
 my dream job
i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end
i guess it's something that i realized
i like to see
the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography
i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something
in that
realm i guess
i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to
gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries
i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that
i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome
um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot
in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and
see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to
stir things up
oh gosh okay um
i'm trying to think
one of my trips
i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is
one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places
i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so
um
and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made
and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like
white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful
or something that's different too
cool
um
pretty easy as long as I
get well no i always sleep so easy
oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world
i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of 
energizing me so no it's not too bad
that's good
uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in
so
it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck
barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like
when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so
but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh
all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]
yes
but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because
i'm just trying to find like what
i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries
so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation
it's all good
uh no i don't think so but i mean
i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can
but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds
nope
nope
oh let's see
uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail
'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home
so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it
so
ten years ago
well that would've made me like twelve so
 [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act
i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time
and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it
and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes 
um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just
expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder
kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good
i don't try to go above that
if that makes any sense
uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v
[laughter]
but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap
or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done
so
[laughter]
that's a tough question
um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college
um
i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east
and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year
and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont
and um
i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in
and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing 
um
but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like
um
just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well
and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not
um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy
that's probably one
yeah
it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]
yeah
bubbly 
fun 
maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um
probably 
 uh definitely friendly
um and pretty like a positive person
um
but sometimes maybe a little bit
aggressive but
for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]
huh 
really happy
oh when i was in mexico
over winter well
no i don't know
my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in 
san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun
that was a good time
yeah it was cool
[laughter] bye
