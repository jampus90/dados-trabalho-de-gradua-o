value
yes
um i'm fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human
um i was born i was born in l_a i was raised out in the suburbs um i've lived all over los angeles i've lived in the valley long beach and now i'm in culver city
um
there's great food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow
there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people uh i think that's really great 
that is a much longer list i would like to get out of here um the
the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too 
i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology
i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it 
everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling> 
um i think maybe
managing a um managing a research
you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to
something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that
it's a hard question to answer <laughter>
i do
um
i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world
well i traveled for eight months in central america
um and i visited a lot of different countries i
um i went scuba diving
i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up
vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter>
i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um
to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control 
<laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting
getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um
we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight
um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people 
i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh
couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground
yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i
seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge 
i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend
um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal  
i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm
i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself 
a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that
<laughter>
no i have not
no
yes
i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago 
yes
um i was cutting and my
one of my best friends called
um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um
it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help
i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks 
<laughter>
uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back
lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and
my routine of go to school
and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit 
weird finding out what to do with my
finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um
depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california 
almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um
about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep 
sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep
um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i
i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um
i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile
probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens  
uh <makes sound with mouth>
really happy i mean um
i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's
really happy on new year's eve which was um
uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them
i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life
i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults
um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and
i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn 
uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really
amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this
uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in
something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this 
cave system um and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so 
that was that was pretty good <laughter> 
i'm trying to remember that at the moment i haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school um <laughter> so uh i guess reading hiking um
just being together with my friends doing um
relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking playing with my cat
not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but um you know i'm still here so can't be that bad
hmm
um
i don't know hang in there um hold on to your clothes 'cause the nineties are coming back in fashion
hmm
um cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets being in um being out in nature
kind of being away from the hubub of the city getting a good grade <laughter>
i think my boyfriend has he's just um especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's 
really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say um to <t> so to see someone overcome that 
uh really inspired me 
okay
