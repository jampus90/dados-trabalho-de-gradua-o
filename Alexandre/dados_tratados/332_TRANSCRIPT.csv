um it gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody
and
hopefully they can give you answers most of 'em don't they try to find the answers inside of you
and get it out of you but
it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kinda biased neutral 
really depressed <laughter> extremely depressed 
yeah 
poverty <laughter>

yes 
no
but
um 
well i don't really consider myself an introvert 
um yeah 
i have a lot of regrets but there really wasn't anything i could do about it so there's really no point in regretting it
'cause you do what you do and you make a decision and then 
it's already done so why regret it why bother
