value
I'm doing good.
from los engeles california
around the cool weather the beaches the people the schools
Development of children
Yes
To be a teacher of special education
It's not hard because I love working with children.
Yes
"dishonesty, perhaps"
um
"like when a guy like especially when it comes to relationships, when they lie to you about something that's very minimal"
my mom I want to say my mom
to very close we talk every day
"very close, although I don't live with them, I try to see them as much as I can"
It's okay <Laughter>
It's good.
It's
"Yes, I do."
"They're friendly, it's just that they're very quiet."
Because I didn't get used to this environment.
"it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap, so that's good and they're friendly, so it's okay, I wish it would have been a little better, so yeah"
Yes <Laughter>
I had another way to live with someone else.
"and I'm still friends with the woman and I come to find out that we're connecting more than the roommates I live with, so I'm sorry to move in with the roommates I have now, against whom I should have moved in the beginning, so, but I'm stuck for a year, so it's whatever it is"
That's all right.
How do I know who
i
Yes <Laughter>
There's nothing that really makes me angry that I can think of at the top of my head
um
um
"Maybe when it comes to schools, how they might treat the children especially colored"
that makes me really angry
mm yes
Because I do things from within I think so to do things internally motivated I guess yes
"Yeah, that's good."
Wow
I hardly argue with anyone <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
"Oh my sister, I guess my sister who was about a month ago"
"Uh I felt very cheated and insulted because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespectful to me in any way because I'm an adult, so yeah I didn't feel the situation at all"
um
only that she interferes in the business of adult people and
it was a conversation between me and my mother and I guess she heard what was being said
"and she felt like through my actions that I chose someone else about my family if that wasn't even the case, but because she didn't know the whole situation that she just automatically accepted and put stuff on Facebook about me disrespectfully calling me by name and it was just so <Laughter>"
"and she then comes to me about it as she did all these other things on Facebook I don't, that's one thing I don't like is if you hate I have indirect comments like if you have to talk to me directly to me don't put it on Facebook tell other people"
"This is a pet peeve of mine, so I really don't like it."
"Yeah, well, I mean, we're fine now."
So that's good.
"Yeah, that's good."
not
People so easy to believe
"so gullible, not so gullible"
"I guess I've heard that lately, as I think, someone is saying something that someone is saying without really thinking about it or without them proving it, so I think you could say I had a lot of mistakes I don't want to say I regretted it because I'm glad I went through it while I was younger than I was getting older and going through the same situations so around"
"Yes, I think people are too easy and I give people too many chances"
so
"Yeah, that's good."
"when I went on a cruise that was a happy experience when I went on a cruise with my family to Mexico when I was sixteen, about six years ago"
Yes <Laughter>
"Yes, I mean yes, I guess it was <Laughter>"
"No, I really want it."
um
try to see new things new views of the world around trying to see the different types of food around how the government is and how they run things out there I think
um
"Yeah, I'm planning to go to the Bahamas next year."
I plan to actually do a lot of travel next year
so
"Yeah, that's good."
It's pretty good.
"Oh, kind of."
I'm tired <Laughter> and I fall asleep in class and what's not
"Yeah, that's good."
It's my fault.
Ahem probably today
"Yeah, that's good."
"Well, I fell asleep late, so it's my fault."
"No, I feel pretty happy now."
mhm
no
no
no
very friendly and funny
Talkative
To get through high school
we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week I'll try to see them at least every few months
They are everywhere <Laughter> around yeah
No comment on this
"They're smarter, they learn more than we learned in the day they learn, they're very advanced, but when it comes to technology, they're not out, they're always on the computer on their phones, they don't play outside anymore, they don't care about nature or the little things in life, they just do, but when it comes to their mentality, they argue smarter, because the schools get better, I won't lie that way."
when what happened
I was just...
All right.
Last weekend I guess
Right now.
um 
What did I do?
"Being with my boyfriend makes me really happy, so I just hung out with him last weekend and I can never see him that much, yeah"
Because he works I have school different schedules
It's not that bad <Laughter>
He's my friend I've known for six months.
We met by a friend together
