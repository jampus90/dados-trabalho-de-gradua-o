Four years ago
"No, not right now."

not only lately
uh
"Well, my wife left three weeks ago and then I couldn't sleep."
uh
"I don't know, I just bury myself in things"
I don't know I'm just doing things.
"I try to keep my mind away from it, like yoga and other things, to keep my mind away from everything"
I've never gone to therapy.
"Wait, I didn't go to therapy."
like three four years ago
Because I went to a separate therapist.
but then I went to a
one thing where I did them a number of uh cognitive tests <te> tests and memory tests and then she diagnosed me with some kind of depression that lasts for a long time as I get depressed and it takes months at the end
"- Yeah, I know."
"To be honest, I don't know."
I think it's more about how you focus on yourself and how
"I don't know, I don't know how to explain that it's like you have to figure out things in yourself that you don't have to talk to."
good original when I went to a therapist I was ordered court now I want to go to therapy for my anger management though
I don't know what the hell
< slaughter>
"I mean, my wife left three weeks ago, so yes."
< slaughter>
That's probably the hardest thing I've ever done.
"Well, considering that I'm only nineteen, if I could go back nineteen years, I'd say not to screw up"
and let me be depressed about certain things that would have driven my wife away
and not to be angry
Yes drive away my wife <Laughter>
yes many things every day <d> every day
I couldn't have broken anything.
and I could have had uh
Finished uh
as if I basically blocked the outer universe and I put everything in myself and concentrated on other things so that I didn't focus on the real life that I got away and so in this sense didn't pay attention to it and that's basically why she went
I mean that and being angry
Because how
Both contributed their own share
her own portion
Earlier today
uh
"I mean, I feel really happy all the time and then it's like going away it's like going back and forth like one day I'm going to be a second I'm going to be really happy and then another second I'm going to be really sad because I'm thinking about something again and it's like I'm keeping my mind from things and how to go forward and how to think and"
"I don't know how to explain it, it's just something you feel."
