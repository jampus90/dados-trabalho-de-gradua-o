value
Yes
Very good
New York
Just turn the volume a little up
< slaughter>
Eh for a change
"Yeah, it's good."
I wanted to <wa>
I wanted to see what Los Angeles was all about.
"Uh, probably lasted a year or two."
You know I'm away from my family.
"what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods the people and only ever acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here"
the weather
"You can't beat the weather, it's usually always nice, it's not too hot, it's not too cold"
"It's creative, I like movies."
like the beach
Transport
There's a lot of traffic
uh 
some of the sometimes I think the people here are a little colder than and more distant and unfriendly than other places
I was a history major
no
uh i do uh demonstrations in really <rea>
uh high-end supermarkets
Uh being a screenwriter
this is one of the reasons why I came to go Angels
It's hard because I don't always uh focus and motivation
I'm getting distracted from other things
< slaughter>
I've always been interested in movies since I was a kid.
and I was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination
I've been in the last
likely
"almost ten years I have travelled more than I had in the past <pa> Well, I have always traveled, even as a child my parents would travel around"
So yes.
seeing new places and uh seeing people who are different than I see how they live
and take to the sights
Uh I went to Kenya that was probably one of the best trips I ever had to go on the safari and
just going out in a jeep and seeing <Laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible
"Oh yes, this is one of the great experiences of my life"
and I also got to uh
a place in Egypt uh at the end of this trip
"Um, uh, called Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh"
"sharm el sheikh, which is right on the water and it has some of the best diving in the world that is hard to believe that"
Egypt would but it was just amazing I left <we> I didn't go diving I went uh snorkeling
What do I do to relax uh I do I like to listen to music
"I like watching movies helps me relax, because it brings me out of you to know whatever could be in my head"
I meditate every day
"I like to take walks in nature, which is always reassuring"
especially down at the uh of the ocean
uh
What it depends on <Laughter> Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times
uh 
"I will do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself down, which is something I have recently learned how to do"
which is very helpful
and also since I'm not meditating it about things as easily annoyed as I have done in the past
some things that really makes me angry
I think uh think about injustice
done in the world or to people when
uh
It doesn't really have to be that we could all get along.
um 
and make the world better
"Last night, I was at a film screening."
"from an independent movie and I didn't think it was done very well, it's not so much that we had a funny argument"
about uh about the movie
"It was like you knew that happened yesterday, so it was in my head."
< slaughter>
there is everything I regret yes there are possibilities in my life
that I wish I had
Uh took her and persecuted her
uh certain jobs
"You know, the first time I got out of Angeles, I had an opportunity, uh"
become a handle
and uh and I probably should've tracked that
How did I decide that I don't really understand the questions?
take advantage of every opportunity that came my way
always <alway> I think say yes
uh on every occasion is very important and doesn't matter
how you think you know you need to be confident that you will be able to achieve what you want to do
no
no
"No, but I was depressed in my life."
uh for the most part I have felt good sometimes uh I feel a little blue uh
I think you sometimes know if I allow <allo>
"regret to come into my mind that can bring me down, but I can usually tell you to come out when it's pretty fast"
Uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh
an opportunity around how to explain it anyway there
"sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is a way i that if I had made another decision, I could have more money or my life would be different"
um 
not really I mean I feel
pretty much the same
What made me look for help for <Laughter>?
"I've been good okay, it generally helped talk to someone when I did that."
I have no problem sleeping.
uh 
Usually I'm grumpy <laughter> so if I don't sleep well uh you know I feel tired and irritable
uh 
how would my best friend describe me
"That's a good question about friendly <f> Well, I'm friendly <f> I'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little mysterious"
To I would probably that I should
they would like to see me achieve more and uh and uh reach my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier
I think...
"It's hard, it depends"
sometimes I'm very introverted because I like to write so it means that I have to spend time alone and then when I'm out of this uh I'm extroverted so I don't really see myself with
as one hard way or the other everything depends on my situation and my mood
my best qualities around
"I think I'll take care of it, I think I'm smart"
"I think I'm funny, I'm going out."
um
I have a sympathetic personality
You know that people said that
"I'm captivating, but not oppressive or overly captivating, there's some kind of cool detachment."
um
and creatively intuitive
<Laughter> yes <Laughter>
the last time I felt really happy
"I don't know that I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy"
I had breakfast I was happy
the sun was shining
< slaughter>
um 
I think like I said to go to Kenya
was an unforgettable experience I remember scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience that I remembered you saw all the colors in the ocean
you know
and feel the sun powerful sun on my back
um
almost about what you know because <beca> almost over
People in a way just in contact with everything that the universe
"Yes, it would be nice to feel that way, any moment of the day, but"
what I am most proud of in my life
I think I've...
Help
<ft> persons
uh and
sometimes when they were in crisis
You know I wrote some scripts.
um 
I had good relationships.
to be good relationships only you know to be connected to someone else you know
Spending time with them
and connection
on emotional and
<Laughter> physical and
Psychic levels
What could be a song I hear on the radio?
"Uh, it could be uh."
Many times you look forward to something you know when I go into a movie bowling
Hanging with people
um
They know how to look at the work
and to work and feel productive can put me in it brings me into a good mood
You're welcome.
See you.
