value
Yes
How about you?
Here
Yes
the weather
Weather mainly
yes the main weather
I'm sorry.
not the people good some of the people things like that some people
"Okay, I'll cut you off."
not as much as before
"I was in school earlier and have traveled many places for conferences and such things, but I'm not in school now, but later I'll go back to school and I'll travel more, but no doubt"
I don't know.
I don't enjoy traveling
"Uh that's a good question that you're actually pretty good at I studied physics and aerospace technology, but physics mainly"
"Yeah, I'm actually"
just now I teach community college physics and astronomy uh but I still do research in physics also because I like this kind of thing and I'm going back to college hopefully that's why I'm sometimes nervous on the questionnaire
Impressive
Professor in a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or so
where the professors work three hours a week and the graduates do the rest
You're really pretty good at it.
I have a lot of people.
"The first one I appreciate is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school, although he led me to an engineer instead of a physics major. He was still a very good influence he told me."
He's the first one to teach me this.
"School was not about a class, but about learning"
All right.
I'm pretty good I think
"I'm single, so I don't turn into many arguments, but it's probably my brother over"
"he always likes to play a video game together I know I'm pretty old to play video games, but they're actually pretty good"
"It's probably so and I get angry at him and him trying to defend himself, and I'm right that's all"
pretty close to
I see her pretty
quite often I see parents a few times a week
"they're getting older, so I helped with food things like that"
And I see my brother
equal with him equal amount <amo> at the same time my sister I teach her children my nephews uh so I see her about once a week also
interesting
Yes
because I spend a long time doing math and reading
and not to talk to anyone who is introverted
"I guess I play video games or I learn, I learn, I think a lot"
At least I'm trying to...
"I roll my eyes, what I've been told is a bad thing."
um
"And that's it, I think."
< Deep breath>
Poor education
basically parents are more self-centered to themselves in contrast to previous generations and the children only
do what they want because the parents are not there for <fo> the parents are not parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion
<Sigh>
um
I guess...
Scrubbed_entry
um
Scrubbed_entry
Scrubbed_entry
Thank you.
I don't really have a best friend.
Introverted Remembrance
I'm obviously biased.
But they are
I'm really good at math
"I'm not sure you can't say you can't get better than me, but the thing is"
"It's just that you achieve a certain confidence with it, where no matter what it is, you need to learn mathematics you can always find out it around I'm patient I think"
"and I'm disciplined where I can spend many hours I can spend many hours reading books that may not be important, but they might be important, so I have to do it anyway"
this kind of thing
when I have a good workout
do good in video games little things like that
um
"what is really happy when my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing, if it goes well, that must put me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood"
Thank you.
Right now.
It is the fact that
Research that I've made it this far
"Research wise, that's all"
That's all.
interesting to
when you start at school
You read about Einstein and things like that it's that he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics
and
"You still haven't realized that you're interested in it, but you're not sure if you're actually going to make it."
"and finally every step passes as a lot of time you want,"
"as time goes, you can get closer and closer finally make the goal finally you realize that you're just not as good as Einstein, but you're up there you can add research in physics to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you don't see you doing yourself if you're a child"
All right.
um
"a few weeks ago, when I got a good grade in a class"
Thank you.
yes short
Many years ago <ag> yes
"I don't know that I always thought that I always thought that it was my dream when I was a child, that's why and I just walked so"
Around I was a national guard I think about eighteen nineteen
"I was commissioned on twenty twenty twenty-one and I was only for about a year, so I went on twenty twenty-two"
Yes
not really
"I don't think I thought it was just something that you grew up something about <abo> something that I already expected it to be, so it didn't change me that much"
Graduate School
in physics
no
Yes
it depends on whether I really train hard the night before <bef> the day before
"if training is pretty hard it's bad, but if I don't workout it I don't just know it's hard anyway"
I guess moderate
Thank you.
Yes
It's okay.
I'm probably the way I am now.
"normal I don't think I'm so happy about everything, but still pretty okay I can still work"
no
Maybe something
I'm sorry.
no
Yes
yes I have changes in my mind
"To get back to graduate school it was a while and something worried happy that it looks good, but worried that it might not be good and things like the"
"What do you mean, if I know this is a computer, but how hard it is to deal with these thoughts or how hard it is to go to school?"
I understand
All right.
I agree
"No, not really."
"probably continue to do what you do, even if I don't believe it or not"
Twenty years ago I was probably fifteen no no yes yes it was fifteen
"I think I was very happy and happy how it worked if it was a little different, I don't think it would have worked so well."
"Although it's not perfect right now, I think I'm doing really well personally."
Thank you.
also here
Goodbye.
