made 75 dollars on a job with the county basically it was an emergency preparation exercise they ran for their staff and they recruited people to play
who are basically the relatives of people who are in a
Case uh bombing in the parenthesis center and we know that the asked questions signed you know that they give them the information I miss

"You know about my self-esteem that you could say, so I had something to hang on the wall."
"Yeah, I'm sorry you know"
Displace family members
I would have...
basically was not so impetuous and left thinking jobs < think> thinking that
"You know, I could still get one and not you know it"
I could probably work at one of the employers I've worked for the moment
"They added places, but I burned bridges there, so that's not possible."
Thank you.
Hasta luego
