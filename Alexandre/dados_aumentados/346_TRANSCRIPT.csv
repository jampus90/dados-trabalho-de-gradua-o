value
Yes
I'm fine.
here in los engeles
there are a lot of things to do I love the beach
I love that I love that it's sunny all the time
To the crowd of people
um 
this is really the crowd of people
Just a little.
I just go to new places and discover new things
"I was in New York recently, I was there for about three months"
"Um, and it was extremely boring that I went to Western New York."
It was extremely snowy and...
"I wasn't in a position where I didn't have a car, so I couldn't go very many places and I was in a small town"
"So, um..."
- I don't know.
"It was nice for what I got to see, but really"
It wasn't really much for him <Laughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
um 
I'm both an introverter and an extroverter.
um 
I really enjoy doing things alone
um 
I've spent a lot of my own around my preferences and dislikes and I've spent a lot of time alone even though I have a lot of friends
"And when I go out, I tend to meet a lot of people, but I also enjoy being a lot of myself."
um 
probably outgoing creative
um 
Aged
to have fun trustworthy
um 
I've studied language around
and physics
and
Mathematics
"No, I'm not."
I'm actually...
I'm trying to be an actress.
It was something I fell into when I was a teenager
Scrubbed_entry
And I really enjoyed doing it and I hadn't done it in years.
"So I figured why I didn't just come back to California and could try so well, something I really like to do"
I just got picked up by an agent.
"So as an adult, I haven't done anything yet"
But...
"I hope,"
in the hope that it will be fruitful
um 
I really didn't have too many.
um 
I guess my sister did really well.
um 
"My friend, he's a"
He's a very positive person.
um 
But...
really I haven't had too many positive influences
um 
"I'm close, I mean, we're hanging out, I'm not telling them everything."
You're kind of judgmental.
But...
"Except I mean, I mean, we're hanging out, I mean, I see her every day"
um 
"Oh, my God!"
um 
"It's kind of hard for me to relax, I mean, I'm trying to watch t_v"
"Um, and I'm reading"
A lot...
"That's probably about me reading that I sleep a lot <Laughter> I'm a little depressed, so to"
"Yeah, it's kind of xxx, like I said, it's really hard for me to relax"
um 
It's not that.
I tend to think a lot
about the things that emphasize me
"I've been through a lot of things, so..."
"I don't sleep very well at night, and when I fall asleep, I wake up all night, usually with some kind of anxiety attack."
um 
I dream a lot about the stuff that uh has
influenced me over the years.
You usually know how I dream about something that stressed me out and then I wake up and my chest will hurt
um 
or just I just can't sleep all night because I think I seem to be I don't know if I'm afraid to sleep
but I... <sigh>
I just don't know that I feel like this is a vulnerable place for me.
Because of everything that happened to me.
"So, um..."
so I sleep is just not really something I do well
um 
tired
I'm...
"I'm moody, I'm very sensitive"
um 
I'm just negative <ne> a negative person
"Um, I'm really not."
I'm like < l> judgment is not me either
I'm just not a nice person to be here
um 
I'm trying to read a lot of time I'm trying to go out and force myself to do things
just to keep myself in touch
So I just sit around and stay on the fact that I can't sleep and I try to make myself as exhausted as possible
to run around and do things
so 
It's difficult.
I like a part of me that doesn't want to.
I don't really want to go out and do things that I have to force myself to do when I have appointments.
I make appointments to like for auditions or around
"Also to do that, I tend to uh"
only not
as in the last minute I will try to convince myself not to go <Laughter> but then I force myself anyway
Yes
I was diagnosed for two cases.
To diagnose I was diagnosed <dia> about three years ago three and a half years ago
and then I was diagnosed again around August
um 
The first time it was...
I just didn't sleep because I didn't sleep.
and the uh just the stress <st> of incredible stress
um 
and then the second time it was a xxx uh again I started sleeping with the not around and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me around
and I just couldn't stand it anymore
So I thought...
I became too gloomy I became like
don't think life was worth it and i i i that I just had to see someone before something escalated
"Yeah, that's good."
It was
i no <n> not
One of the reasons I went to New York was to try
Get out of my surroundings
um
and uh
and that seemed to help a lot
um 
and out here I was just the advisors I just didn't really seem to help me much
"Um, they're just..."
they seemed to give me a lot of medication and I don't think that's what I needed
um 
"Yeah, so..."
"Yeah, that's good."
<sigh>stressed uh uh lately I was really sad and I don't know why
um 
"But as I said, I tried to fight this by..."
keep me busy
um 
"In fact,"
I'm kind of
A few days ago
I was really really happy and I was really happy
But then I went back to
you know you're going back to the miserable feeling
so
um 
"Well, I realized"
"I got up in the morning, I really got a good night of sleep"
and
I realized I was really happy.
Because I've been through a lot in my life and I have someone in my life who really loves me and someone who's finally there for me
and uh
"You know, he gives me what I need emotionally and I was just very grateful for the"
and that made me really happy
um 
"Yeah, that's good."
Thank you very much <Laughter>
"Oh, God, what are you doing?"
um 
I've had so many years of just
just bad a lot bad
that it was there a long time ago
Since I'm proud of everything
I guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships I've been through
around my <m> a smaller person I guess would have
got rid of himself a long time ago
but even if I'm really depressed and feel dark and I just feel miserable about many things
There must be a silver lining.
so 
"So, yeah, I mean, I think that's what I'm proud of."
I'm still trying to be a good person to try not to be negative to other people
and
and truthfully and I still have to drive inside me
"Yeah, that's good."
So much...
My last marriage
Don't come out if I should have
um 
and uh just
I regret a lot
<Sigh>
the situation that would have a red flag...
"You know, some things just don't work."
and
"No matter how much you try, no matter how much you put in it."
I'd tell myself to...
that it is not selfish
Let go of a bad situation
"and not everyone can be helped, so sometimes you only have to live for yourself and help yourself"
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
had I known that then I had known that
then I would probably have done better in life
so 
"Yeah, that's good."
<Sigh>
um
People who
when people fall on me because of my mistakes
That I've done that I have things I've done in my past that people are still alive when I'm trying to forgive myself.
"People who are mean to other people, uh, people who talk badly about people behind their backs, people who are untrustworthy"
um
only anyone looking for the little guy
um 
You know people who don't care about the environment or animals
um 
I think everyone should be as good as possible.
"And it's discouraging and it just makes me so angry that people just can't be people who don't let people live, who try to make everyone feel as negative and as bad as they do"
And uh i that makes me angry
<Laughter> I unraveled <Laughter>
"Yeah, I tend to vent and then uh"
"And then it's usually over, I'm not trying to mouth bad people"
I'm just trying to talk it through until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore
mm
I'm not trying to get angry
because I have a really bad temper
and it's
and it can be out of hand so around
what I do is i <laughter> something makes me so angry I tend to go and take a nap
"To <Laughter> If I'm not in this situation where I can just take a nap, I usually just walk away from the situation and try to clean up my mind"
and come back to him
um 
"It was a few days ago, it was actually with my mother"
It was about
"actually, she thought that I had taken a shirt from her"
"And around her cried out, and cried to me, and round about,"
"I was tired, I was late."
"I started screaming <a> back to her you know, because I was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty"
and you <yo> <sigh>
"It goes back to my past, you know, when I was younger and you know I didn't care that you knew people's things and I just kind of took and did what I wanted and I'm not that far from that person"
"It hurt me, so I got angry and I and I started screaming and fighting."
"mm kind of petty and stupid, but"
at the time when it seemed
It seemed uh
Viable
um 
hmm
one of my most memorable experiences
um 
"God, I've had so many..."
Maybe
It was...
I don't know.
um 
It was
It's probably due to
Graduated from pharmacy school
"I felt pretty great, I didn't know if I did."
uh very good or not uh and I always ended up like on my last test results I always landed <get> like ninety eight percent
and
- I don't know.
"I actually had no confidence that I had done well at school and I didn't even know how to get the grades I got, so that was a really great achievement for me."
and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah
"Yeah, that's good."
um 
I'm reliable.
um 
i um 
I'm talented.
For the
I'm a good listener
um 
I'm always here to help people.
um 
I always try to do the right thing
um 
"sometimes I forget that I have some good qualities, but"
um 
and only
- I don't know.
everywhere I try to be you know how good and the best person I can be for other people and myself
um 
"Yeah, that's good."
um 
Go to comedy shows
um 
Just...
To have moments in which you just laugh with people
um 
sometimes just reading brings me into a good mood
uh 
I don't know.
Maybe it's time.
uh huh 
All right.
Thank you.
See you.
