hi
"Yeah, I'm fine."
I'm doing great.
"Yeah, that's good."
to I am from los angeles I was born in santa monica
"Yeah, that's good."
um
I like...
"I don't know that there's nothing I mean, I don't really like it here, but I guess I like that there's still some nature, it's not like New York like town, but I think you know it's okay <Laughter>"
"I don't like traffic, I don't like how crowded it is, the crowds make me really nervous and I don't like the whole smog pollution all that stuff <Laughter>"
"No, I'm not traveling, I wasn't really somewhere like this <Laughter>"
I studied psychology when I went to s_m_c.
"I took a psychology class, so I was psychology major I took an anthropology class and I took mathematics, but I'm not good at math <Laughter>"
No I uh I'm not in school right now around yeah I'm just home <Laughter>
My dream job would be...
"I want to help other people as long as it's something that helps other people, uh I want to help other people with how p_t_s_d and problems and so on..."
"Yeah, as long as I am, you know you're helping other people smile, and you know that my problems are connected to other people."
"I'm close, I'm very close to my grandma."
"Oh my family, it's just anyway we're not like too close we kind of argue a lot <Laughter>"
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm sorry about what an introvert is.
All right.
when I'm annoyed to
"Well, I try to relax for a minute I usually just try to take deep breaths, but it's hard <Laughter>"
"Yeah, that's good."
"I'm not so good at it uh my temper got a little worse, uh I'm not at all good at really controlling my temper, uh I need some help on this <Laughter>"
"No, not really, I mean, no, I guess it's not as bad as most people I've never been in a fight or anything or yes that"
"I argued with my mother and sister yesterday, it was just something stupid, like"
"My sister is sitting in the front seat and she's a kid and it's like I should be in the front seat, so I just asked her to sit in the back and of course she starts screaming and arguing and it's like really annoying <Laughter>"
"Yes, it does."
Thank you.
"My grandma always gives me encouragement and she's a therapist, a licensed therapist, so she's always you know she really did it."
easy for me to have someone I can talk to and I could always go to her
So that helps
"Yeah, that's good."
my most memorable experiences well I had a really good experience around me riding and that was really really happy
"I love horses and nature, which is the greatest thing I love and it has made me so happy and so relaxed that it was an unforgettable experience <Laughter>"
to be caring
"I don't judge, I never judge that I'm never crazy, I'll never get mad at anyone else, just like my family you know, but"
yeah just very nice caring and so <Laughter>
Things that put me in a good mood like uh music nature
"I like to cook a lot I like to cook you know, for my family speak to me in a really good mood I love meeting new people new people brings me into the best mood"
"It's not easy, it's hard, sometimes it's really hard."
"I don't usually sleep well, so..."
"Yeah, I'm having trouble falling asleep."
I guess it's like my mind knows a lot of you racing sometimes it's going to be flashbacks of bad memories
Only you know.
Thinking too much <Laughter>
"Um, I don't know, I just think, um..."
Stress You know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what solves it <Laughter>
"I'm just trying to stay positive, I'm trying to think like okay, but you know, one day it's gonna get better."
um  
I'm just trying to call someone and talk to them when I have problems like my grandma.
"Yeah, that's good."
Thank you.
"when I don't sleep well, I start crying and I start to get really irritable"
around I get really depressed it doesn't make me feel good at all I get very uh it's just really bad if I don't sleep yes
"Yeah, that's good."
Thank you.
Yes
I was diagnosed three years ago.
"I just didn't know what was going on, then I realized that they diagnosed that and..."
"I was how okay that's the problem and I just wanted to help because it's just when your mind is after you, like it's just terrible if your mind is in control of you so"
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, it's hard."
"Yeah, yeah, I definitely always thought I had a problem, I always thought something was really wrong."
"I always like a little nervous around people, as if I could never really look someone in the eyes, because I'm just as nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and I"
"To have sweat, if I were in the situation that reminded me of the situation, how I just try to avoid what reminds me and brings these flashbacks yes"
"Oh, I felt good, I got more out every day, I'm trying, um, I guess going keeps my mind from my p_t_s_d symptoms, so I'm trying to walk more that helps"
Thank you.
"Yeah, I'm depressed."
"around it helps yes it really helps me a lot around I haven't got one right now I'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's some kind of confusion, but yes it really helps me"
I noticed that I had less flashbacks and...
"I was more relaxed, I guess, and..."
"Yeah, all you know is that you're trying to keep more busy, yeah, it helps."
The last time I felt really happy about
I guess...
"I don't know today, because I mean, I'm glad to be part of this [laughter]."
um highly proud of uh
Good <sigh>um
I'm trying to think about what I'm most proud of.
i 
think I'm very proud of how the fact that I'm able to you don't know how well I mean most people I know that they deny that they have a problem and I'm proud that I really like
"You know, a person who can see that I have a problem and I need help"
but many of the people I know they're not on medication are untreated and...
they just don't want to get help and I'm glad to get help because I don't want to feel that way and I want to get help for the problem instead of doing that
"Oh, God, there's a lot I regret yes there's a lot around"
"I regret that you know that drug abuse you know, but that's part of you know that p_t_s_d I regret about"
many uh mistakes you know relationships things like that
I would have told myself.
um
I guess the advice I would have given myself was:
"trying to keep my mind more relaxed, I guess"
"Yeah, that's good."
um
"Well, I'm a very nice person and I always like to smile people always say how I smile a lot, but to smile I think it hides somehow like what's on the inside, but you know I'm pretty depressed you know, but"
I'm just trying to keep smiling and I always like to give a hand to help and people feel better
"for fun I like going to the mall that's a lot of fun, I like going to the mall, I like going out with my grandma"
We go places to go shopping I love shopping and I like to go
um
Play like games like I like to play video games that are fun stuff like that
"Okay, thanks."
Goodbye.
