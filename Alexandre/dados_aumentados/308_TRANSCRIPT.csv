I have applied from everywhere and everywhere
From entry level to administration
to anywhere between and around

About three years ago
Four years ago
A few years ago
my mood was just not right
"I always felt depressed and depressed, and I always wanted to sleep in lack of energy"
Lack of interest
"I went to therapy, it was useful to me in the past"
"is it useful for me now I don't know, I have no health insurance"
um
"I'd like to talk to someone, I just feel like I don't have anyone"
So I don't rely on anyone.
"Oh yeah, I've always felt depressed in my life"
mm
Lack of energy
I want a lot of sleep
Lack of interest
my appetite was uncontrollable either lack of or I was just slimy and eating the wrong things
Yes
My sister just died.
It's all right six months ago.
and I became
Homeless and unemployed two weeks ago
and it came to a point where
I just missed her and I wanted to be with her
so
mm
fairly dysfunctional family
You know you can't rely on her.
That's why I'm just relying on myself.
It's what you're gonna do
"I'd like to give up, but..."
"My parents buried their daughter six months ago, and they don't want to bury their other daughter."
so
<Sigh>
I don't know.
"I don't know, just uh"
I just wasn't lucky.
I've been a business manager for twenty years.
and uh
"Who would have known twenty years ago what advice I would have given myself, because"
I tried to commit suicide instead of returning to work.
And now it's just... it's been hard trying to pick up all the parts and
Bringing my life back together
um
I don't know what advice I'd give myself
when I started my company job twenty years ago
Because I didn't know I'd be here twenty years later.
you know
Really Happy
um
a few days ago this week
I tried to meet.
I have a lot of things that sprout
I've got a lot of things
"This is happening for me, but I need two more weeks here in l_a"
"so that I can connect the points, but"
"financially, I don't have what it takes to stay here for another two weeks"
so
I was happy because I called back and
"To <sigh> things started looking for me, but there's just time again is not on my side, so my car is packed and I'm on the road"
And I'm leaving and I'm leaving so
Uh loyal
emotional
strong
That's it.
um
I've been doing this lately.
I was an extrovert for
Twenty years when I was a corporate manager
and now I'm quite an introvert and I'm staying with me
Uh circumstances in my life I don't feel so confident
I don't feel
as uh charming
and as a social
mm
I don't know.
It's hard to say
I can't really answer that.
Thank you.
See you.
