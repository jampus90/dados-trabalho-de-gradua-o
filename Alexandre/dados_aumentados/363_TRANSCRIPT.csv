value
<sync>
Yes
"All right, how are you?"
I'm from los closeles
Yes
um
it's uh center of everything anyway you drive to all the places you need to uh eh without being very far
I like being in town
All right.
in l_a you are also dealing with traffic a lot of traffic jams
and around obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not so big
but
You know you live with it
"I was a business manager, so I studied economics and..."
After I finished college
Uh pursued a career in retail
Uh no I'm actually not I'm kind of a changed career
"over the last four or five years, so I focus more on the company's staff side."
a few factors around i after many years in the retail trade
I switched and worked in a uh creative business that was a graphic design company and I uh caught a knowledge < knowledge> a lot of knowledge about
in the a in the personnel page because I was the company manager Slash Benefits Manager for a small company
"Yes, I'm very happy that I did that, and I've collected a lot of knowledge and uh"
and it's very helpful
< slaughter>
"Well, my dream job is..."
I'm basically doing what I want to do now because I'm a uh.
independent contractor I do freelance work as a consultant with all the knowledge I gained from previous jobs
and I use that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personal and have the time I need to do the things I want to do
"and obviously I have worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already in place so"
"I do what I need to do as far as to get a certain lifestyle, but also I also enjoy what I do, I'm not under as much stress as I used to be"
mm
I'm not
"Well, I'm not quite out, but I'm not I'm not extremely shy I'm"
"Probably right in the middle maybe more towards going out, but I'm not completely starting out I mean"
"When I'm with other people, I'm in a social situation, I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but..."
Obviously I have my own little uh private problems that I hold for myself
"Oh, sure you know I'm..."
A few years ago I had a heart attack and I had to have bypass surgery and it had to
"Yes, it had to do with stress and things like that I don't talk about much other than those around me that are close to me."
"When I meet someone new, I'm not just saying openly that you know that I've experienced this and that, so basically, I'm just..."
"When it comes, I won't deny it, or when it comes and when it is, when it feels like it's something I'm going to talk about"
"In fact,"
"My relaxation is up, I'm just around"
living with my mother my mother and uh she's an elderly citizen and she's alone around what I do to relieve uh relaxation or stress is I actually help her to work yard
"take care of all the gardening and such things and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know,"
I'm not...
I'm not
It takes a lot to make me really angry as far as my temper is concerned.
There's not much to it.
um
"I'm trying to think here, I can't remember the last time it was, but it was probably sometime last year when I had a creditor I was dealing with."
very difficult to work with to
and I owed money as far as some medical expenses that had occurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago and uh
they weren't very understanding of the situation and I uh uh I was really a little upset about it because
"I felt like I was being honest with them and I was more than willing to take care of my problems, but uh, they played hardball and I didn't care about it."
It does <Laughter>
probably the toughest xxx decision I ever had to make was to
it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who fought against uh prostate cancer and
"Yes uh a decision to make with my mother whether using a procedure that was either to help him, or there was an easy chance that it would help him even though he was pretty much at the end at this point"
or it would kill him you know
"And that was really hard, it was really hard to make decision, but uh uh you know, i"
I felt like I wasn't trying to see if we could save his life <l> helping to save his life or if we weren't taking any chances and taking this extra step that I would regret in the long run
It's
It was
um
"I'm separated from my wife, so she has her problems, I have my problems, but we're not divorced, we're just separated."
"And we still have a relationship in which we still talk, we just don't live together."
"And the relationship with my mother is really great, you know, she's very understanding I'm a single child so"
She likes to have me what is good because she is eighty two years old in her late she at her later stage of her life
and
and so she must
"I guess it's a good thing that fate may have happened in its own way, because you know anyway,"
"someone eighty-two years old alone in a huge house is not a good thing, but with me because I think she feels <fe> it's a comfort level she feels at me because especially her only child"
Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things I did to hurt my marriage
"Um, as far as..."
"the things I did the selfish things I did when I was much younger, which obviously influenced the relationship between me and my wife"
"Oh, yeah, I..."
in a situation in which:
To make me work enormous amounts of hours under a lot of stress my wife also worked a lot of hours in a job that she had and uh we grow apart
"And when she was gone, my form of release was, uh, going to the casinos and playing and so"
"You know, I spent a lot of time at the casinos, and what happened was that I spent a lot of money."
and obviously this was an important topic in relation to our relationship
had to do with trust because to
It was devastating for my wife
I felt when it came to light
I felt very guilty
and I felt less than a person at this point in my life
"No, not at all."
No not really no
"I have no problems sleeping, that's I can never remember having any problems, so no"
no
Not at all
"No, I'm good I just < deep breath> the only thing I could say is"
after I had my heart attack a few years ago
I won't let the little details or little things in my life bother me the way I used to.
so I tend to be a little easier and my friends and family have noticed that
the last time I felt really happy
um
"Probably, if"
I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack
and
he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that
He was glad to explain that there was no scar tissue.
no larger scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart attack
and that I could count on a fairly normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medication
"Well, I guess number one is uh"
my physical being itself
I may be a little healthier to lose some more weight
um
just generally just be healthier physically
and as far as mental for just not
go back to those ways of thinking where I did the wrong things instead of the right things and not being so selfish
only one day at a time
You know I just...
try to be at peace with myself and try to have a little rest on a daily basis
"I'm meditating, I'm reading, you know, I'm reading a few books, I'm watching to do things I know when I can, when I can help myself"
I do things to help myself
"Well, there's a lot I obviously regret in my marriage"
"uh my uh professional career, as far as I've had a long career with this majors uh food chain and"
"and I basically ended up ruining a very good career because of my gambling problems, but"
um
"at this point at the moment there's not much I can do, I can't change what has been done"
so I don't focus too much on the past
I'm just looking at what's in front of me and just focusing on what's in front of me.
what advice <Laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing
"for yourself and you know, make the changes that need to be changed"
You know I'm not.
"I'm not someone who's not intelligent, but I was smart enough to know what's right and..."
Scrubbed_entry
"You are what you do is wrong, you need to change your behavior immediately"
likely
The proud thing I'm proud of is the fact that
"I've done all these terrible things, but deep down, I don't think I'm a bad person as a person I need to remember."
"When I was trapped in all this gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had a disease, a compulsive"
Uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me sick and that I was a sick person trying to get better
And every day what my life is about it is about recovery and uh
"I'm just making sure I do the right things, from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night."
One day at a time
"It's not as hard as you think it is, but it's a process in which"
You must be diligent about your behavior and routines
"And just to know that what's not right for you, you know that it might be okay for other people to do certain things, but I can't do those things anymore."
Most of my best friends can describe me as likely
Generous and generous
To be a nice person to be near
and
you know
They were obviously a little shocked when they found out about all my problems.
uh in connection with gambling and the
"mine and the separation from my marriage you know it's not over, you know."
"Well, my ideal weekend usually starts around"
after having breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock
I'm going to a local park and it's about
This park is probably set up where you can go up a hill and down a hill it is about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning
um
my blood is flowing and my heart rate starts and then after that...
You know you're going home.
Work in the yard a few hours
shower and relax and then
Just uh somehow step back for the rest of the day and then the next day I do the same in the morning again I go for a walk
Train in the yard
watch t_v whatever easy relax
so goes a weekend for me
and thank you
See you.
