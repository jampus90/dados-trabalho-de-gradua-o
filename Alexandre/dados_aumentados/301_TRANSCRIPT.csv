value
Thank you.
mmm k
"I'm doing fine, thank you."
I'm from los closeles
"Oh, great."
I live in West los Engels of the West
It's all right.
i xxx
"No, I live alone."
"I love being from here, so I grew up here, it's natural."
the weather for good the weather
"It's always good, it's never bad, there's always something to do, it's rarely a boring moment"
Transport
"traffic is terribly good likely traffic is terrible in almost every big city, but I hate traffic"
"not really I mean, I have enough things going on here, so when I travel, it's usually somewhere within the driving distance"
I studied uh business
I did it.
"No, I've been done for a few years, so I haven't gone to school in a while."
"One day I'll go back to graduate school, but"
My dream job would be to just work for me and make a lot of money.
"I don't know that I don't really have a dream job, just something I can do"
I can work under my own conditions and be decently paid and be in a creative creative environment
um
"I don't know, I think it's just a question of finding the right situation, so at the moment it was people are a little conservative, what they want, so and how they want it, so it's a little harder than it seems it should be, but I don't know, I think if the situation is right, I don't think it's too difficult"
"Yes, yes, yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
I work as an assistant to an administrative assistant through a time agency
It's just basically I'm being sent out to do uh
To do desk jobs
"Yeah and no, I mean, I feel like I could do more, but you know, it works like this."
You know what I mean.
"I'm pretty close, I mean, they're so"
"Oh, God, really crazy."
Stupid people just do anything to piss me off
um
That's basically <ba> that's the big thing to only irritate stupid people who just do things to provoke me for no reason
What is a good example?
"just random people who find it funny just to sit there and get an ascent out of me, but it doesn't have to be one no specific"
Situation is just people who just think it's funny that I think they're just generally sadistic and they think it's just funny to just prod you as it is to poking a stick on an angry dog know that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so
"Oh, God, I told you."
I don't remember i with these situations that I usually try not to remember <Laughter> when it happens I just let it go and just like the past the past I tend not to look back
What do you mean?
All right.
"God, what do I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym"
"Listening to music, I've got a lot of musician friends so I'm just so I'm usually around musician so"
something I like
I like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to everything that is art and creative in general.
Who was a positive <pos>
I think they're just friends in general who seem to do well and I think they're very inspiring and
"That's sometimes a bit tough in a city like Los Angeles, where I think everyone's on their way to reach their own goals so they don't"
Sometimes it's hard to find someone who picks up or tries to be inspiring.
"I don't have anyone in particular, but people raised something here and there."
"You know exactly how hey instead of doing this, how to do about this or hey you're good at this, why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know, I'm always looking for new ways so they always point out things that maybe I could do differently"
"instead of just saying negative, hey don't do that that's not, that's why you're doing that it's a waste of time"
I guess it depends on who you're talking to.
I'm fine that maybe I could work on it.
um
"I don't know, I mean, I think I can do it better"
"well back to the point that people provoke me, so I mean, I'm not trying to blow steam and get them under my skin so I usually try not to get it to me"
"but I don't know, I guess with temperament I think it depends on how I handle my stress"
lately I've been better at it just because I think my situation was a little better
no
no
no
um
Nothing big
"I mean, maybe when I was younger, I could have traveled more, or I could have worked towards something that paid better job, but I mean,"
"These are all things I think at every point in life that you always think I should have, but you know,"
"But then again I think that's for everyone, of course, I mean, I could be a banker or I could be a lawyer or a doctor and about ten times the money I'm making right now, but"
"But then again I don't like the law and I don't like medicine, so it wasn't meant like that"
"Yeah, that's good."
so
"Um, I think"
I think my
"in my life, I knew that"
"I have a lot of things I have <ha> there are more dislikes <laughter> than I like, so I kind of cramped it up to what I'm good and what am I not good in and what am I going to work well or who am I good at working and who am I not going to work well with"
So I sort of sort out and then the list type of
mmm of the kind of itself answers so
"No, I don't think it was hard, but it was just, but I think it was a real reality check and I think it's kind of a good thing because sometimes trying to adapt to things that don't really fit you makes no sense"
"It's like trying to push a round pole into a square a square hole and it's like it just doesn't matter how you try to push it in, it won't go in, so sometimes it's just so good to go down a path that seems to work better for you."
unforgettable experiences around hmm
"I think it's just, I don't really like everyone in particular, I think every day is almost like an unforgettable experience, whether it's positive or negative, I think it's just everything if it's just the fact that"
"I have a job and I can take care of myself is almost like an unforgettable experience maybe for the average person it sounds stupid, but you know, I think just the fact that I'm able to"
"I am able to get as far in life without how completely self-destruct is already an achievement, so I feel like"
I've come somewhere.
"Maybe not to get to the point of the average person they like to think how good, why aren't you a millionaire, but you know what not everyone can be a millionaire"
"Yeah, that's good."
um
when was the last time I felt really happy
um
I don't know that I'm not really someone who likes
"I don't have really high or low lows, I mean, I haven't reached lows, so I mean,"
"I don't know that I'm usually pretty, I feel like a level person and I'm pretty happy <ha> every day I feel like I'm reaching a thing then I'm pretty happy so"
I guess to answer the question probably
"Mmm probably yesterday I just feel like when I'm able to achieve something then, hey I'm happy"
"I don't know, I don't really have a best friend, but I mean well to answer the question in general friends"
"I think they'd say that I'm pretty much out, I'm pretty"
Determined
I'm trying to you know I'm trying to you know that I'm trying to interact as much as possible I'm always outside of networking as much as possible
so
"I don't know, I guess that's basically what I think they'd describe me as"
All right.
No problem
All right.
See you.
