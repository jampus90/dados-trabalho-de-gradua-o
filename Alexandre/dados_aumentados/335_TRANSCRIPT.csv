value
Yes
I'm fine.
"I'm from here, originally Los Angeles"
mhm
I like the weather
"And my family's here, which is why I'm here, I've moved away for a while"
I like that there is a lot of
"Culture <cult> although everyone says that there is no culture in l_a, there is a lot of culture, there are theater and film and many museums and so many things that all kinds of people I like the diversity"
mhm
um 
"Well, I don't like having to withdraw against my will, so start a new career"
"I'm starting new in my career, so that's not really something"
I retired because my dad was sick.
so
Thank you.
Thank you.
"So that's why I'm here, but it also means that I live with my dad and my brother who are like Horter and ridiculous."
uh
Acting
Theatre
It was
mhm
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yes, I am."
"I'm an actor, I'm doing a theater show, auditioning and teaching."
something like this kind of thing
"Well, my parents are both"
Artistic people and I grew around them and for a long time I sang and then uh I went to study music theater
"and somewhere along the lines I realized that acting was more my bag than singing I suppose, but I still do both"
mhm
"No, I don't know."
"I usually have no problems talking to people, I'm pretty friendly."
I can usually tell myself with most people their secrets within five minutes to meet me what I feel is a sign of an extroverted <Laughter>
<Laughter>um
I take a bath or read a book
Go out with my friends
Go to the theater
uh
"Anyway sometimes my work is very relaxing, as sometimes as a song sing or one of them go for a walk"
Mm-hmm-yoga
Things that drive me crazy
Injustice <Laughter> I can be very sincerely outraged I suppose to
"People who don't see these things and people who have a similar claim, I think, claim and feeling of privilege that can drive me crazy"
"Yeah, that's good."
uh 
It depends that I usually argue with <Usual> often that I appreciate my case <Laughter> or I usually call my best friend and complain
Talk to her about it
pretty good pretty good I don't have too much temperament
um
like a real argument or like a debate
<Laughter>um
"If it were a real argument, it would probably be my ex-boyfriend, and we were just arguing about why we separated stupid things like this."
"Oh, I think I was kind of"
"over them until then, but"
It was sometimes
< slaughter>
um 
the last time I felt really happy
has been
how really happy
Probably hanging out with friends last night I had a good time
uh
Scrubbed_entry
It's nice.
It's nice.
"my best friend would describe me as an open book, for which she often makes fun of me, as if she would just tell everyone everything around her would make me"
compassionate
and
with a strong feeling about who I am
I think
"yes, she would also consider me as not like a good feeling of social norms sometimes likely that is something that she"
"makes fun of me because I want to tell everyone everything and don't realize that I have holes in my clothes and something like that, but nothing"
Nothing bad we have a very good relationship
hmm
"yeah yeah it doesn't have terrible problems but yes, it got me in trouble before sure"
no
I didn't
"No, but I think I had it"
But I've never been to a doctor.
Because I had a traumatic situation where someone hurt me.
and i
"I felt that when I saw p_t_s_d later, I realized that I felt as if I had all the symptoms of how again in situations like that I would panic and it was very"
Uh I thought it was a really long time
I think...
"I think I had it, but I just don't know because I've never seen anyone about it."
um 
sometimes yes uh
certain physical things with this part of my body can be a trigger or around
It happened in a acting class
"so sometimes certain teachers, when they"
to criticize in a certain way
"I start to panic, even if they're absolutely right and I know they're right and as if it were something that"
"someone else could tell me and I'd agree to it, sometimes it'll make me a little excited or panicky yeah"
no
"Well, I mean, my dad's sick, so not great"
"But when you think about it, it's not terrible."
I have bad dreams.
uh 
Like stress dreams I'm dealing with my dad.
um 
like being abducted or my teeth fall things that when you always tell them as if there was something outside your control that's like exactly what it's so
"It's not the best, but it's just dreams, at least so"
in which direction
All right.
easy very simple
I'm tired and maybe a little irritable silly I'm gonna be really silly
"Yeah, that's good."
um
i
I'm pretty non-judgmental
from other people i i i stay open
I can make most people laugh.
Uh creative
um
i
"Yes, these are some of the best I would say"
"Yeah, that's good."
I love meeting new people and seeing and learning new things uh and just getting out of the routine I like to stay in hotels uh I like most things about traveling I even like to fly I like all of it
"Well, I just finished a tour a few months ago to go up and down the east coast and then perform across the U_s and uh for kids everywhere"
Yes and then we ended up here in l_a
"Yeah, yeah, it was great, it was a good time"
"Yeah, that's good."
um 
lemmi we think
we went to
the hot springs the naturally occurring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to relax
"Yeah, that's good."
a lot of people I would say
"I mean, my dad's probably coming to my mind."
Uh my godmother is a great positive influence in my life as well
Uh my best friend my best friend from high school I think I uh some of my best friends from high school around and college that I somehow grew up with and
will be who I am with them
"Yeah, that's good."
mhm
"Uh, little things for sure"
"Yeah, that's good."
uh
I regret
the way I dealt with it
a friendship that once ended uh I regret
To bind to certain people I was with
uh 
"but nothing big I tend to go well I won't do it again, but I don't spend much time"
how excited about things I've done in the past
hmm
Get up for yourself.
um 
<Laughter> Don't date criminals <Laughter> uh
I think that I
"I have no difficulty standing for things I believe in, but sometimes I have difficulty standing up for myself."
I think I really internalize the idea of how
You know women are too needy or...
"I don't know these kinds of things and then xxx and so as a teenager and growing up I felt like you were good then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took a while to be able to like voice what I want, what I needed from other people and agree with"
and it's still something I'm working on
I'm glad you think so.
um 
<Sigh>
That's a good question.
my friends and family
and uh
I mean talents
I'd say
"Yeah, that's good."
yes my ability to take situations and
take up bad situations and continue and
Make the best of everything
All right.
<Laughter> Thank you
Goodbye <Laughter>
