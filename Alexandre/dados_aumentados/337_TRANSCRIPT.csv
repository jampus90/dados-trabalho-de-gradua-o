value
"Yeah, that's good."
I'm fine.
How are you?
I am originally from a suburb of l_a from the San Gabriel Valley
I like the variety I like the atmosphere of the city I have lived other places and it's just
not
"as happy here I feel like I can really thrive here, so I like l_a"
"like all the things that are so close together, then there are a lot of interesting things that are completely different parts of the city only miles from each other"
uh
may not like the traffic all cars but I can live with it I mean
There's not so much I don't like
I studied music for vocal performance I studied music technology things like
Yes
"I'm singing in an opera company, but I have a day job because it doesn't pay so much if you don't work for the opera."
So I have a day job that I work in a call center that mainly works on
"Actors and actors and such things and it's really good, because when I get a call, I can call and change my shift very easily."
So it's actually a pretty good gig
"and I do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know there's some recording some live sound thing, but I'm kind of wanting to get away from the"
"do some video work sometimes, but again I want to go away from that I want to go back to the"
because I find that more performance is more interesting I like talent more than I like crew <Laughter>
So somehow I want to get away from this side and start working more towards actually doing what I want to do with my life
sometimes I mean by my personal life yeah so I have a bowl that I get out there to deal with people
"But when I'm home, you know, I'd rather think of myself or my husband or my cats or talk to the family."
You don't really have too many close friends < clears throat> but yeah you know
I'd rather stay with me.
"mediocrely close to the family I've left, I've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so"
but how
Thanks <Laughter> but how uh my I'm close to my husband and
"You know, I have some cousins I'm talking to, and my aunt I have an aunt with who I'm talking to a little bit, but it's not like we interact close by every day."
But it's
a little short
mostly I sing or read or write or
only
hang and try
"clarifies my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just"
make everything clear and see what comes back in
and
"sometimes <ss> sometimes that sometimes it doesn't work, but mostly to create things"
"to contact my family, some <so> you know about Facebook or whatever"
"works, but"
mostly in my spare time I create things
I would like to travel more I like to travel by car a lot around
"I mean, my idea of"
"like a birthday party, going on a road trip"
and I like to travel around more
"I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to travel"
see <see> uh especially traveling by car seeing how the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know how to change the vibrations of the region feel
I like to see what's out there and I know that there's a bigger world outside of
where I am and where I live and my world and I like to see this
but I like to leave this and go back to my own world <Laughter>
<laughter> < empties the throat> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> <l
um
Let's see.
"xxx a trip I like to take is to take the trip from here to Nevada, whether I go all the way to vegas or just go state line"
around my cousin and I would take what we call
"Leave a ride because once you reach the first exit of a highway, you are either in another state or you are at the end of the highway, so we would take the only"
Type of improvisation with how <li> a day or two notes just move things around just stand out
So these are actually trips I like to make because I take off and then sometimes on the same day sometimes overnight
"only small short trips, which"
"are not very involved, but you can just walk and see things and see how"
"to you know the desert landscape looks at different seasons, how people react at different times of the year in different areas"
"so close to home, but not"
"but not close to home near home, but uh still a world away, so because I don't really take time like a two-week vacation or whatever, but these are just small things that"
"somehow things back in perspective and and my head and things like that clear, I mean because there's a kind of feeling of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't drive on a highway"
So I like to do that
"the last time that happened was May of last year, that was the last time I could do that"
we actually came my aunt with my cousin who is ten years younger than I am
and we grew up kind of like sisters and I was about to move away from the inland kingdom where they live
So they took me to one last hurrah and we drove up to vegas
"and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it, so she kind of"
I showed them some of the local websites around there
and we came back and were
you know
"an overnight stay, but we were driving like this all the time <Laughter>"
It was kind of an interesting
"Things that are by nature unfair when people are mean to older people, children or animals, people who cannot fight back, and they are mean to them just because they can't fight back"
and
I'm actually...
how to see people who are
strong <st> as strong as the people who want to stand up and be an advocate
Or what's wrong with you?
So I think this is one thing that really makes me angry just being cruel or mean for no reason
"You don't know people for people who can't fight back, or for people who didn't do anything to earn it."
just that somehow really drives me crazy
"If I am angry, I will try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me, then I will somehow end lasching out either"
"You know, orally, just"
Cut it with a quip or
you know
"I mean, I'm rarely gonna yell at anyone"
But I'm trying to tell you.
"if I try to go away and defuse it if it doesn't work, then I let them know that they're annoying me and coming away from me <Laughter> that usually works"
"not in like legal problems or so, because normally I will find a way to"
I want you to leave me alone.
um
"So there aren't really big problems, but because I think it's because it's gone-putting and it's not expected < exp> the expected reaction"
"and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that's gonna work and get people away from me, so it's not really in trouble and if"
"It's trouble, it's usually trouble,"
"It's from the perspective of the other person and it doesn't affect me at all, because it's usually a situation I can get out of."
"As long as they leave me alone, you know, I'm not leaving."
Last time I was fighting with someone.
For example:
Person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or someone not in my
The last thing I can think about was
i
quarreling with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she has dementia
"and if we were one of the reasons we came here from the inland kingdom, we were to take care of her, because she's not going anywhere, except l_a"
"I mean, she's like hardcore angelino as you know we know we're that in our nature"
"But we also know it's cheaper to live somewhere else, but we came here to take care of them."
"And he wants her to stay in her apartment, and I want her to move in with us."
"because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she were to live with us, but she wants to stay where she is because she cannot see that there is now inherent danger due to the disease process"
"But he wants her to stay where she's supposed to be, that she's able to have what she wants, because he's a mama boy like"
"I'm a mama girl, although I lost my mother, like four years ago, I'm still a mama girl and I'm still going to be <st> and I'm still and I know that"
it
brings you
"a feeling of satisfaction to fulfill their wishes because you care so much about them and that's what they want, so you want to get it for them and because you know that they know that this has happened to you"
When you grew up trying to give you what you want because you wanted to.
"And you want to do that for them now, like a way to give them back someone you care about someone you feel you deserve."
"But it's kind of dangerous for her, and I don't want anything to happen to her."
"But I want her to stay, who she is, as long as she can, because I know how to erase the disease that she has, who she is, after all,"
and finally she has to be taken to a place where she can give her twenty-four hours of medically trained care
"But until then, we can deal with you knowing it between us because it's not that bad."
but it comes where she really shouldn't live anymore <shou>
so the solution now is he stays there most of the time with her and I go back to our house and I it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I do
I handle the outer things that I lead the errands I bring them to the store things like that he makes the day to day things make sure she has <ha>she eats makes sure that they know that clean clothes things like the
"So I mean, it's a partnership, it's a partnership, it's a partnership."
a double effort it is very much a double effort
"But I want her to move in with us, so it was like"
"a source of it is not really like screaming screaming argument, but"
lively discussion <Laughter>
You know as a debate
meh
"It's not insurmountable, I mean, life will never be easy."
"And if that's what it is, then you should be worried, because someone can pull the carpet out under you."
"As long as you're above everything and present in your life, it won't be easy."
but you deal with it and you keep moving
Uh the most positive influence I believe were probably my mother and grandmother
Because my mother was pretty much a single mother and my grandmother helped raise me and she actually
gave me a lot of trust
and were realistic about it
"So I mean, I think I have some kind of"
"realistic kind of downer temperament for me, but they helped me see that it's just inside me and it's not something I can't get over"
"And that you know life goes on, you know my mom would say to me if you were 40, you're 40, whether you're working at Mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life."
"and I think that was a big influence on how I lived, how I lived my life since she died"
I regret that I did not take care of myself in my mother's last year of life because I think it has clouded some of my decisions.
now I have underlying conditions and everyone in my family is diabetic and I didn't care when she was the last year of her life because I was too busy getting her home
I wanted to take her home.
"So I didn't eat properly, I didn't take my insulin properly, I made myself insulin resistant that this year just because my blood sugar was as high as a year"
Eating only terrible food when I ate
So it really took a toll and I really got very sick
and I wonder well if I don't
"if I had taken care of myself and had my head completely straight and my vision and thoughts were not complete, were not clouded"
"I would have made better decisions on her behalf, especially if she needed them."
and when she needed me to step in and make the decisions for her because she
"She had a health disaster because she had a kidney, and she had kidney damage that led to kidney failure."
your health insurance provider misses that
So she ended up with
Such a kind of this whole thing
Disaster where everything began to break at once
"She had a stroke like a fifties, which she had a small stroke."
"and it just went down from there, so I think well, if I hadn't, if I had taken care of a better care of myself, I would have been able to take better care of her"
And I know
"There was nothing I would have been able to prevent her death, but what if I had been able to make it easier for her"
if I'd taken care of myself and that's like a great regret I've had
"Oh, I know I'm <Laughter> but xxx it's"
my desire to take responsibility
for everyone and everything that matters to me to take responsibility for my own life and me and mine and I know other people I can't really do
to direct them into my own vision because they are their own
Individuals
And they do not know
be what I want them to be and I know they won't be
But I still have you know my ideals
and I want the way that I want everything to go and I want everyone who is important to me to be happy and also to be able to
fits into my life
"in a way in the best possible way, but I know because they are other beings"
"and I know I won't be able to do that for them, and they won't be able to do that for me, but it's still my ideals, so sometimes I have to look at it and go well"
is what I want because I want it or what is what they want and what their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually their
"And I know it's theirs, so if you really care about someone, you're just gonna support them and go with them, but..."
It's still
kind of hard <Laughter> for me and I know I have to get through it
um
Ten or twenty years ago
probably to be in the beginning of my own life because I wound up around my mother I mean her
became sick literally the weekend I finished in college <Laughter> and I had a job set up and I had to pull out of it because she needed me to take care of her
And I think I would have been more aggressive if I had started my own life getting a job out there.
the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like this built up instead of just completely her daughter for about ten years
so
I think I probably would have done that.
But I'm telling myself that you keep who you are and learn to separate.
you are who you are and what you have to do for your family
to keep a feeling of yourself that is probably what I would have done and do things for myself to keep that feeling of myself that is probably the supply of what I would give myself
Ten years ago <Laughter>
no
no
"No, but probably because I didn't go to the doctor because I don't want to know."
"and I mean, it's not"
I know there were times in my life when I was very depressed and it's usually circumstances.
"and had to pull me out of her, but I'd rather pull myself out of her before I resort to treatment."
and it gets <ge>
um
"After my mother died, I mean, it had been such a long fight for a year that we had lost and I didn't know it."
"If I was responsible for logically doing so, I knew it wasn't me."
but
how could I convince myself
"Two weeks after her death, I'm with"
Pulmonary embolism
"in one in each lung because I didn't look at myself for a year and I thought, oh I'm thirty years old when"
"You know what I'm doing to myself, I can't get over any Laughter, but..."
"I mean, I had to take more medication."
because of the
It was a struggle to get my own health back to be able to
To get out of this depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden.
the carpet was pulled out my like ground fell out of my world after that so
that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression around I was almost divorced because it was because I just didn't want anything anymore
so
"and I was really away from my husband, until that time we were married for about two years at this point and I started very far away from him just pushing everything away just"
You know what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life.
and it
It's already
"A fight you know, you mean there are times when I couldn't get up."
Just stay in bed and sleep all day you know.
but then
to recognize that:
"When my mother died, I had four cats to watch for two, my two are her and so I adopted the two who were her, I mean good"
They have no choice if they can buy their own food and buy their own food.
I took the responsibility to do it for them.
"So that was a motivating factor that they had no choice whether I would get up or not and take care of them, I mean, I could go without eating, I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't"
They didn't know.
they actually have me up and
"and let me go and face things, even if I didn't want to, not only didn't just want to somehow lure and die, but that wouldn't have been my choice and they I mean what would happen to them"
"If I wasn't there to take care of her, they'd be"
You know sent to a shelter or whatever likely
"and maybe they wouldn't have taken me back and adopted me from someone else, maybe they'd have been killed."
for me I mean to make selfish decisions for me
So it's like I need someone to take care of me to get me out of bed <Laughter> and that was actually a motivating factor
"because I found out that if it were just me, I would be able to live without a lot of stuff, I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted it not to be a big deal I don't care"
"as long as I did what I wanted to do with my life, but"
I need to take care of a family.
So I have to get out and do things
"You know, I need to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day you know, day job I need to know you,"
"but I'm trying to find a balance between the two, because that's what I want to do with my life, but still I have to take care of my family, so I'm"
Work on a balance between the two
very <Laughter> but it's worth it
"I mean,"
it would be very I would have much less things to worry about if I only lived in my car and said forget it <Laughter>
but keep
a residence below pay bills things like that
"it's difficult, but you have to do it, you know, if you want something <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through it"
and I and I know that
but
it's gonna be hard sometimes you want to give up
but then
It's how good what the alternative is
"I mean, I don't think I could live a pleasant life."
"Because if I did, I wouldn't do anything <Laughter> I have to be something uncomfortable or I won't do anything to myself I'll just be"
"Be happy to just stay in bed all day, hang out with my cats or whatever"
and I wouldn't do anything
Very
Scary and nervous and I mean what if
I can't find it.
enough you know enough work to pay my rent or whatever if...
You know what if I can't?
to keep
"a similarity of stability in my life and it's actually hard work to be stable <Laughter> and I know it's hard work to be stable, but"
"What you know, it's just a lot of what ifs"
and I don't think it's things that didn't happen and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that didn't happen and I know that
but it still happens <ha> it's still crawling in
So this is actually
a source for
Anxiety
but then try to let the fear go by doing things by finding out the things that make a solid plan and go after it.
But I know it's a cycle
"and I'll assume to be really scared and oh my God, what am I going to do, what am I going to do to say okay what is"
the basic thing I have to take from here
I mean what <wha> what is only foreign and what can <c> what can what
is what are the actual non-problems and what is the real problem
And so
figure out how to do things this way and then the fear starts to disappear a little bit
but then something will pop up and what will pop up again
mm I have to
uh 
Find out again <Laughter> but I know it's a cycle I know what seems huge on the surface when you start hacking it away
"You get over it pretty fast, you get through."
the last time I felt really happy
I don't know.
zz
um
i 
huh <Laughter> that's a good question that actually really <ac> that actually surprisingly dull me
because sometimes I feel happy sometimes not so much sometimes just kind of
in the middle
um
really how happy happy I don't know
I can't imagine when this happened.
I don't know you don't know.
I mean perceptions of other people
probably as someone who
"Strangely enough, someone who is left behind and you know,"
"treats things as they come, but I don't see myself like this"
In general
and it's a
probably that I can think on my feet and
I'm not afraid.
Huss my ass away and do whatever I need to survive and do things
To do this.
"and I can make it creative and I try,"
Search for balance
likely
Probably the best things about me <Laughter>
"that I basically do what I want with my life, although it's not all easy it's not"
um
"You know, I'm not financially good or what it's still a lot more than many people can say about their lives because I have an aunt I really don't talk to"
"who and the reason I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable, I mean, she's got"
a career that they
It's more like a job she fell into
"Because my older aunt loves animals, but she didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog nurse."
and she was really good at it she had a stable business for a long time
but her hands <ha> know that she began to get arthritis in her hands and
She had... my cousin's father...
"stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business"
and she retired early because she retired early between that and arthritis.
"she occupied my younger aunt, who was still a dog nurse, but she hates it"
And it's like you're changing your life so much when you change your life.
And the thing I'm most proud of is
"Yeah, I'm not as financially good at what she is, but I do what I want with my life you know I can"
being creative I can have creative people around me that I really like to talk to around me
People I really like in my life and
to be satisfied with
and I see a lot of people who don't
and it gives me a feeling of maybe a bloated feeling of complacency to be able to say I'm not so
"and I actually do what I want, although there are victims I still basically do what I want with my life now"
Thank you very much <Laughter>
All right.
Thank you very much <Laughter>
Goodbye.
