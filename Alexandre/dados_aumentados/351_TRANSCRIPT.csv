To New York
to look for a job in the music industry

I'm self-employed.
to become a music producer
It's pretty hard that there's a lot of competition <Laughter>
um
to look for a job
"Um, if..."
about a year ago last February
It was quite difficult east coast is much different than the west coast
I think I've been there twice last year.
"No, I'm more of a creature of habit"
"Um, yeah."
"Sometimes I feel like I don't fit into the crowd, so it's better to be quieter sometimes and see everything instead of knowing that you're going in and pursuing things actively."
um
<Laughter> probably uh listen to music and spend time with my dogs
<freezes the neck>
likely to be insensitive to humans around
not very nice to me or...
To see or to see injustices
"I think that's it, <Laughter>"
"Um, pretty good."
you know sometimes <so>
um
Probably a few days ago around one of my friends said that she said a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about it
"Yes, it does <Laughter>"
Pretty close
"My best friend, so..."
"Oh, just one of my friends"
um
"I'm kind of quiet about it, and when a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when I usually overreact"
It's pretty hard to find out more about the person that I somehow withdraw and actively engage in myself instead of getting it to the point where it's like around it comes to a point where it blows out of the relationship
um
to probably spend time with my family
in New York
very close
um
my sister and my brother
I don't know they're just great people.
and I love her very much and
"They're very similar to me, so I feel like I have people who understand me."
um
likely
um
I guess loyally...
sensitive to <Laughter>
I don't know it's kind of hard <Laughter> it's a difficult question <Laughter>

"God, I think probably nineteen ninety seven so long ago"
um
I just went through this time I just went through a lot of problems and I felt insecure to myself so that I end up going to the doctor to get some medication and therapy and so
um not at the moment I have been about six months ago
I just thought the therapist wasn't really helping me. I thought we were talking about the same things over and over again.
"xxx she wasn't really challenging me and I've been in therapy for a really long time, so I just knew it was a change"
It's okay <Laughter>
"Yes, I do."
when I feel connected to a therapist and when I feel like it's a great way for me to talk about what I'm going through.
um
"I'm better at describing my feelings and feelings, I think the biggest thing is to"
"When I'm in situations, I can see how I react in a way, and I take a step back and see how I can usually almost react in a way."
I also tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and somehow bury them and make them feel really bad about myself.
"So it's nice to talk to someone who doesn't judge, who doesn't really tell me, as you know, that they tell me it's o okay, basically <free throat>"
um
To be hopeless all the time
don't you know enough energy to do things I like I had a little concentration problems
um
with strange disturbing thoughts sometimes just in my mind and only overall just feeling a little lousy about life
um
"Sometimes they're like random moments when there's something like a problem with my interpersonal life or something like that, or when I even see something on TV sometimes that affects me"
"To listen to music or distract me to try, as my therapist told me the longest, to log."

"It was a hard transition to come here, so uh good to be here, so to be half and half in order and not to be all right."
"I have the feeling that I've been a little more withdrawn lately, but that's what it is."
"around < clears throat> on some days it is great, on some days it has not been a little more difficult recently."
I don't know why I have so many thoughts about my mind at night <empty throat> so I tend not to sleep very well and I wake up quite often during the night <empty throat>
♪ Smokes the throat ♪ ♪ Very groggy in the morning ♪
It's like I'm yawning a lot during the day and my friends are always so oh why yawn you are so uninterested in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not like that at all <Laughter>
Probably Christmas time when I was with my family
just really happy and...
Feeling that everything in my life was all right
with a good feeling of how I was present at this moment with myself
um
Maybe you know.
"Let's see, that's a difficult question."
I think probably
"I can read people well sometimes, and..."
uh I like to say uh I'm good at being a good friend to people being a good family member uh
"I'm a hard worker when I have a job, so <Laughter>"
um
"To be sure that I mean, it's life, so there's, of course, regret about"
one that comes to mind is the desire that I don't eat so much so that I can be much more healthy <Laughter>
um
Do not take things so seriously <Laughter> to enjoy being teeny and to
I think that's it <Laughter>
um
I don't know.
That's a good question.
probably to my previous job and my occupation I have worked really well with children around
So I did a great job that I was a researcher.
To go to a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out
"for about six years, i.e. seven years"
"Yes, it was fantastic"
um
I was really kind of like
Reading people and so I decided to major in psychology <clears throat>
"So uh, and then I went to work in a..."
Psychiatry and research with them to deal with drugs and depression and such things
it found like a good niche for me
<Laughter> okay
No problem <Laughter>
Goodbye <Laughter>
