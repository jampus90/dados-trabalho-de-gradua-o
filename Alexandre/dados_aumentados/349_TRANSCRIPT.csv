You know more ways to do different things and explore different things
Areas of interest

Abuse and and neglect and uh just

It's really hard to say that I didn't have very good uh
Uh very positive role models around
um 
ask me the question again
<Sigh>
"Well, maybe my mother at best"
"But it's also a negative aspect of my life, but..."
uh
"Yeah, I guess I can't identify anyone who was really positively influenced in my life."
the journeys I was on
"To me, I used to"
I've always done yoga.
I've always meditated.
"I used to train, and I've always done it."
"I've done a lot of things lately, but I find it hard to relax, I don't have the same."
the same outlets I made before
the same uh
"I don't follow her so much anymore, I guess I'm"
"I've lost my motivation or something I'm depressed about, you know, I guess that's where it's right there."
um
pretty good
"I'm so spirited, to the point of uh"
"Uh physicality, I never know that around"
But I'm standing on my floor and...
but I can control my temperament i never lose control really
around <sigh> last time
Probably.
"Um, as late as you know"
last month or so I may have argued with around
uh an acquaintance about uh
uh
I don't know that I have to come back to this question.
no
no
Yes
um 
"well officially October of last year, but I think I'm longer depressed than that, but officially October of last year"
um 
actually I was treated uh for other medical problems and
um
my depression was so remarkable for the doctors
"Yeah, that's good."
"Yeah, that's good."
um 
"Well, I've never been suicidal, but just to just in i I've just often thought about"
eh
"that I don't have much reason to live I thought I had a purpose and stuff, but"
I don't have anyone in my life.
who I think takes care of me enough uh
"that I was really <rea> when I was even dead, uh so"
I kind of lost myself.
and around that was once enough
that I was around enough to uh
"You know you have purpuse in my life, but..."
I've lost some of it.
Motivation <motiv> yeah
"Well, I'm trying to pull it together, I'm trying to"
<sigh> get a feeling back from me
"I get inspired again and again, but overall I don't seem to make much progress."
"Yeah, that's good."
"I wouldn't really call it therapy, I don't have a therapist per se, I have a therapist."
a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me
and no one really talk about psychosocial questions
For the
uh huh 
Did you say it was annoying?
eh 
All right.
And yes.
to overwhelmed busy around
I'm just trying to stay alive and watch over everything.
no
uh 
It's easy if I can't.
"Yeah, if I have a chance to fall asleep, I don't have a problem with that."
More
distracted and...
More
uh lousy I guess the word is
Whatever
Uh if I had a best friend around <sigh>
I don't know about <sigh>
"he may have many positive adjectives before, but now only you know, just uh"
Some people say I should be proud because I survive a hard time or some people think that uh
I'm a loser.
<Laughter> like this
um
"I don't know, maybe around"
a survivor
uh persistently
"Well, I've always been proud of my career and"
I give back people who give back to society because I was given.
It felt like around <sigh>
So I'm just proud of uh
"I don't have much pride anymore, to be honest."
I don't know.
<Laughter> Psychology
and
Good at first
"um not really in itself, although my current career includes a lot of uh"
psychology a lot of
I don't know what I'm saying.
"it's a part of it, but it's not the center of it."
"Well, I guess if my career still goes, I'm in care, but..."
I've been sick lately and with depression and other health problems i
uh have uh found it necessary to apply for disability social security income
and I start the process because I don't work
Very
"I mean, I had my dream jobs."
I had my dream jobs that I didn't have.
"I don't know what the future will be like, uh, work, but, um..."
something I suppose to work with people again
Health uh help in any way
"Um, no, but lately with the depression more often"
"I've always said that I've never regretted anything because I'd make the best decision for all things ahead of me, but..."
I just wish there were times when...
the decisions I would have been
< slaughter>
were better because some decisions I apparently made or were made for me made my world somehow fucked up
for lack of a better word shit
what I don't understand
<Sigh>
to be strong to believe in myself
"to remember that I've survived a lot of things, and I'm going to survive that too"
to get up and move me
to < sigh>
To have confidence
Faith
To <sigh>
I just kicked my ass with murphy's law
"as much as you know, I just uh"
"It seems like I've been trying to make my world better, I'm getting depressed again and again."
so
It's almost like I'm
"I don't want to give up, but every time I try to move forward, I get knocked back and it gets exhausting"
and I have no support system really no one
not really
<Sigh>
um 
Loyal
um
working hard
um 
reliable
um 
be able to:
"Well, at least I used to be"
uh 
Intelligent
contemplative around eh uh
Deep
not a superficial person around
"Yeah, I guess that's some of them."
Many years ago
I used to have a lot of trust.
"pretty dynamic person I used to be people, said <wou> <s> used to say that I was the centered person they knew"
And I used to
People help and I'm in their shoes now and I don't seem to be able to help myself
<Sigh>
<Sigh>
I can't think of anything.
Right now.
I can't think of anything right now.
"I don't make much fun anymore, but I always go to movies and entertainment venues and travel"
go to dinner with friends doing things around
but lately I don't really have any persecutions
a good day a happy day a funny day for me is a day without anything to go wrong
in principle
< slaughter>
mhm
"Yeah, that's good."
See you.
