Homeschool my ten-year-old son and uh
I am a homemaker I have five children and married twenty-two years
mhm
So this is a full-time job?
We could go to Israel about two months ago.
for a pilgrimage with our church yeah so I'd say yes I've traveled a little bit
uh good last we went to Israel as we did two months ago for a pilgrimage we were about nine days and
It was fabulous that we spent the first five days in Chorazin.
which is near the uh
Galilet
And in a place called uh uh
"I mean, the name of the area is Chorazin, but"
Uh we were in a place called adonis galilea that's a um
a house for the welcomed
To christian uh
Pilgrims and Jewish Pilgrims
"I enjoy how really the most important thing I enjoy is like meeting people and of course seeing the story I mean above all Israel I mean, it's the"
"It's totally old, but..."
Most of the people I enjoy are the people I think to get a better understanding of how different cultures around
Live
no
Not at all
Just don't.
I've known all my life that I've always been
open and ready to socialize and
I always remember my younger brother
I say I'd talk to everyone and I'll talk to everyone.
just because I enjoy learning about other people
um
"Most of the time, like at the end of the day after I cooked dinner and we have dinner together as a family"
There is a word game on the computer that I like to play for a while and then
To see t_v have a cocktail with my husband
"and just relax, that's what we're doing, and you know,"
"Because we have a lot of work to do, we don't stay up too late."
I like to watch crime dramas
um
really crazy probably not much to
"I'm frustrated with my daughter, for example, not cleaning up her room"
almost always
"That makes me angry, but..."
in terms of how really to
always how hotly angry I mean differently than like
little things my children do to you
"especially my oldest child, who is twenty-one"
You know he can be so confrontational.
Except that nothing really makes me angry
I haven't felt it yet.
Contribution to society help uh
Help
"to educate responsible people, I guess"
and of course the love and the affection and the
the fun and excitement that goes with him from all stages that go
"I mean, like right now, I'm in a phase where my kids"
are either adults or teenagers I have only an eleven years old and the rest are all teenagers and adults
so it is really funny because we are able to talk about current events and
all kinds of things that are going on in the world and you know have uh
challenging discussions and such things
So it's a different level than taking care of babies and
You know diapers change and stuff.
The most difficult thing is that it's twenty-four seven.
um
you're never a parent
"You know it's and so you have to accept it, and that's what I remember when I first"
with my first child to
"think you know when I brought him home from the hospital, that's it, I mean, there's no going back you can't"
"I mean, you could if you did something terrible, but..."
"I mean, under normal circumstances, you can't change that, and it's a permanent thing, and"
um
It's...
"in a way it takes away your freedom, but in another way it gives you a different kind of freedom"
mhm
always
I'm sorry.
I didn't understand what you said.
some of the things that made a positive impact in my life most important was my church
around and my faith
"But also my husband, he was really a..."
He's kind of very
how logical thinking and very you know grounded
"So when I get emotional or get upset about something, he's always"
We'll balance each other if he's upset about something I'm able to balance him.
It was a great gift in my life.
I don't think I'd be categorized as someone with a temperament.
"Sometimes I get angry sometimes, but I don't like it"
Rarely have I experienced outbreaks around
I'm more likely to know to tell you what I don't feel to allow it to build
So you know how my husband and I don't
Rarely Fight Like Have
Arguments that
Screaming and screaming or something like that almost never happens
"because like I said, I'm more like a kind of person who communicates right now, so when I think something"
I usually communicate it immediately instead of having it built.
I usually argue with my older son because he
um
You know he thinks he knows everything.
"he is twenty-one years old, so he has the knowledge, it's all mentality"
and I'm just telling him that he doesn't know everything and
"If life continues, he will learn more."
he is very self-confident and very self-confident uh
even uh what is the word itself insured and so he thinks that you know that everything he does is right
and
"He still has a lot to learn, that's all"
mhm
it's it can be mhm
I think...
that many of them are around
pampered and live in an environment of uh
immediate satisfaction
um
what I think will be
to affect the future of this country
But...
"You know that with all the technology we have, there's really no way to go back, so..."
I hope that...
they will be taking
"I mean, I think this country was built on uh hard work and ethics"
and uh
we hope our next generation and the
generations after
can hold that to
I don't know if that's possible.
mm to
loving care for
funny
we laugh a lot and around
Carefully Honest
Things That Uh
"I mean, my best I've got"
"Well, actually, my best friend is"
"There's two people, there's two sisters I grew up with, and..."
we
i
for several years
"cared for her mother who had Alzheimer's before my parents got sick, so I had a very close"
have a very close relationship with them still do
And so around I'm considered the fourth sister
So I'd say these are my best friends and...
we love each other very much
It's a good relationship.
no
no
Yes
Most of the
mostly
mm minor depression it was more anxiety
"Uh, probably..."
"It's probably been five or six years, I mean, I had when out and over my whole life, but it was never originally diagnosed"
"as as a teenager I think is when I first started with the fear, but"
um
"except that I know you, so"
Depression goes with fear when it's not under control
But now it's under control.
I've got a great one
What are you doing?
"No, I think it was what they call free [flee] floating free-floating fear more of one of uh organic"
"For reasons in other words, there was a chemical imbalance"
in my brain
"I felt pretty good, actually the holidays were great to"
we had a
Good family celebrations
a little stressed out because to
"We make a big decision to help my parents, my dad's really sick."
"and we offered to move in with them, they have a big home, but we would have to do a lot"
some renovation and some
to help and some obviously move around
And so we are in the throws of it and around
"So that's a big change, but I'm looking forward to it because"
I don't want my parents to be alone because they're in the '80s.
"as they get closer to death, I want my family there with them"
um
Usually not easy
All my life I think I've always been
"I mean, I'm not I've always had..."
at least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night
um
going to the toilet basically
and uh
"other than that I mean no now I sleep well I mean differently than that I sleep well, but sometimes when I wake up like really early in the morning"
then I can't sleep again I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then
Go back to bed and
"back to sleep idepends, which is my schedule and when the children are"
must be early in school and there are a lot of factors
"Yeah, sometimes it does."
mm
I think I could complain a bit like oh I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know
But...
"I think, overall, probably the same"
my children know that I'm going to tell myself kids oh I'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful
she'll try to cook my other daughter dinner or something so you know
you can put in a little more pitch
not really
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
not really
Nothing significant
What are you doing?
"Uh, actually, yes, I do."
I have the feeling that therapy is useful
We had a problem with my daughter.
um
she also suffers from fear and
We've had them in therapy for some time and we're just about to end
a group with her that was six months long...
uh
group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a
It's the first time they've documented it with teenagers for the first time.
and
It was really good it was
very helpful it is just around
how to live at the moment and how to actually know physically and mentally
Strategies To Keep Your Uh You From
"your mind of getting mad you know, worrying about things or you know"
"in this case, some of the children have tried to get themselves or whatever so"
um
this is the focus of therapy and it was really good my husband and I both go with our daughter
And it was really...
"really informative and really helpful, I think"
Oh my daughter was around her
"in a bad way she was you know, suffer a lot and"
We knew it and...
That's all we've done.
um
For example:
really joyful and happy I would probably say
if:
It would probably be in Israel if we renewed our marriage vows in the in knaan
"You know where the wedding of Cana took place, which was really moving and beautiful."
And it happened that our wedding day was
on our anniversary day we flew to Israel
so it was right at the same time
It was beautiful.
Very meaningful
"and unlike that, I would say you know how"
uh other joyful occasions were you know like Christmas and you know family meetings and
You know my father's birthday was 80 years old.
"On Christmas Eve, you know that something like that"
um
"That's an interesting question, I'd say"
um
"as soon as I'm done like things I have to do, like when I'm"
have a lot of tasks [ch] a lot of work to do the house or
Running errands as soon as I finish
I feel like a feeling of performance
"You know exactly what I mean, I've worked as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a for many years."
You know when you finish a project or you get your whatever end of month stuff done or if there are a lot of different things
"You have to keep to the deadlines, there's a feeling I've managed to make you know."
So I think that would be that you know the most for me...
last
um
How to feel good and how to feel
how feeling reaches
Dream job hm
"I think I've already lived it, I'm also a birth doula"
and
Yes and um
So I've visited a lot of births and now I'm really just doing it for family and friends
and it's the most rewarding thing that you might ask to be involved in
the birth of the new life into this world so
I'd say that's probably
was my dream job and I didn't know
I've trained a lot after you know I've done my management stuff and...
was awesome it is and was awesome so I no longer work in a hospital
The hospital I worked in is now closed.
But...
"like I said, I do it for family members"
um
I happened to be with a friend of mine.
she uh she had the same o_b as I had with all my kids
and
"I came to bring food for her husband when she was at work, we were you know, close friends"
and
"She wanted me to stay, and she didn't want me to leave."
"I didn't plan it, so that was the first birth I had participated in outside of you."
what is a completely different experience
so after that I was really interested in studying possibly un nurse midwife
But then I discovered this thing called a doula that really gives you
even much more hands on uh one on a contact with the patient what I like
So I trained to do this at a hospital in Inglewood
About fifteen years ago
"For my son is fifteen, and he was one year old; he was not sixteen a year old."
"So, um..."
"Yeah, that's good."
and I was
um
"Now it can be difficult in terms of hours, it depends on how long the woman is at work, but"
uh and you also know how
"for me I always tell my friends and my family if they want me to be their doula, that I can't guarantee 100% I don't do it for business"
"and so and that's why I don't like Doula's back, which, if I'm sick or not available, can fill someone else for me"
"But so far, all the women who asked me, I could be there for some reason, so..."
um
"The only one I missed was a friend of mine from church, and she wanted me to go with her second baby."
"I was with her at first, but the labors went so fast that she didn't even call me [Laughter]"
It was in the middle of the night like she was like
"She wouldn't have two hours of work if she had called me, I wouldn't have been there in time [Laughter]"
"So, um..."
"It was really fast, but unlike the"
You know.
"Yes, I was able to visit all the births of people who asked me to do"
um
throughout your life or in your job
Probably my own birth
I mean the birth of my own children
um
as if there were an extreme
Feeling of joy Excitement Relief
because you are naturally out of the pain
And then it's like it's just a question from you.
"From there it goes on, but it is"
"It's like something you can't explain, it's just fantastic."
after birth
and I have experienced both ways that I have made both.
natural and
"my last child was about c_section, so I had both"
both experiences
um
I had a kind of crazy nurse with my third child she was a little bit
"Psychotic, but otherwise we're laughing about it now, but when I was in labor, it wasn't funny"
and around them
she wasn't there when the doctor I mean it was my third child
born very quickly after he broke the water and oof
"my husband was there, but she wasn't the doctor yet and she got a lot of trouble"
because after that I had only two contractions
my daughter was born in bed
"So it was great for me because I didn't have to go through any of the contractions, but"
I'm sure they weren't happy.
Then fill out a lot of paperwork
so
now I would give Mysef for ten or twenty years
um
"Ten or twenty years ago, I was probably more"
Not like...
Don't relax like...
how I now feel at my age that
I don't have the same worries I have then I don't worry about
"I'm not worried at all about what people think about me, I'm not worried at all about what"
you know
"You know, like I said, my daughter, oh mom, you can't wear this because people are gonna say that, I'm just saying I don't care."
"You know, but they do, because it's still in their minds that this oh mama you have to dress like that and dress like that, whatever it is."
"so it would probably be the wisdom you reach with age,"
You see how life is so many things that are more important in life than worrying about small things
what you are most proud of in your life
very proud of the
probably my family my husband and my
"My children, I mean the fact that we stayed married, that we"
We are a tactical family that
um
my children see every day how
their friends who come from divorced families or single parents and
for:
they actually express
Gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still know that we are still a family
So I'd say that's probably it
um
probably the
one of my best qualities is
uh
be able to listen to people and be able to
Don't be judgmental.
through the years I had a
a lot of experience with around
People with problems a lot of friends with problems people I know from the church and
It just taught me that...
Everyone has weaknesses Everyone has problems
and I don't think I'm better than anyone else
"If you think you're better than someone else, it's usually a sign to me that you don't know yourself well enough."
All right.
All right.
Goodbye.
