"Um, musk"
My family moved to the U_s and then I moved down here for college
"uh it took me a long time to live here for about a year since I graduated, so there was a lot of ups and downs, but finally it was adapted so it took a while, though"
It starts and I have two roommates and there's always a bit of drama here and there between
"the girls but for the most part after a year and a few months I think we finally learned how to live together, but it was pretty like a reality t_v show for a while"
One from college and the other from Craigslist.
It varies depending on whether we're mad at each other so much
I guess pretty close
"Right now, we're a little distant."
Oh over the distance
"Okay, we haven't seen each other yet, we haven't met in two weeks."
Because one of them got into this car accident and so she's been distant since then and somehow locked up in her room
"and the other one always works late, so we just got our schedule out and no one really tried to hang out with someone, so it's kind of"
We're just waiting for someone to take the first step.
"It's okay, it's getting better."
it depends on with whom
I'm
Dealing with I think I'd say with some people I don't think with my family very good my friend it's not very good
"but with other people I may not know so well, then I am able to control it a little more, but it becomes more passively aggressive than as full of anger"
"Oh, 'cause I don't want them to see me as a bitch."
"Yeah, that's good."
Uh probably my best friend nicole
She's probably been best friends for like
God since high school newcomer year is the high school when we first got to know so yeah
um
of
of what
my friend nicole
around we met in French grade beginner year of high school
we were in the same class and then we kind of started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we kind of started hanging out and then we just got closer and since then we've been really close
mhm
um
uh go out with friends go out in bars go dancing cycling hiking
Stay active to go to the movies go to eat in restaurants uh photography
um
"just hanging out with friends, I guess"
Whatever
uh
It varies as if I'm really close to them when it comes to things like school work.
such types of
"Things, but when it comes to relationships and friendships and personal things"
I'm not really talking to them.
So I guess superficially close
"But I rely very much on her, so we're close."
mhm
"That's a good question, I guess it depends on who it is again."
I guess people who're ruthless are careless Flakey ignorant
and
uh
"Imagined, yeah, I guess that kind of people, and when people just..."
"What makes me angry, that's a good question, I guess a lot of things drive me crazy [Laughter]"
"but it's mostly how people react to different situations can make me angry, I think"
Yesterday
and it was my friend and we argued because he tried to be healthy and save training and money
And so and so
"So by doing what he does, he's ordered pizza in so he doesn't save money and he's not healthy"
"And so I was frustrated with him because I'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and every time he's like I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it so he constantly breaks promises that another thing makes me angry are people who don't follow through"
about other people or about me or angry
xxxx [Laughter]
um
angry I think I'm going with the no I don't feel angry often
Get the fuck out of here.
that's a tough way to just be paid to be me
"I don't know what I'm trying to find out because I quit my full-time job because I hated it, that it was usually sitting in an office all day, which I thought was extremely boring."
So now I'm working in a restaurant job and I'm trying to look for a second job to support myself.
My dream job
"I don't know what it would be, but I know it would involve people and I would like to have a kind of finished product or some kind of performance towards the end"
I guess it's something I've realized
I like to see it
"the result from all my hard work because I loved in sociology and as much as I did that Major is clear to you, it's a whole lot of theorization and argument, but without any real solution, so it's just like in the end all you have is these theoretical elements that you can't really do with and show nothing for your work, except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so"
something to do with people and maybe something artistic I love photography
I love cooking baking in particular so I don't know anything
in this
Rich I think
I've been traveling a lot my family is known for trips we've gone to
gosh seven eight different countries I have lived in three or four different countries
"I haven't traveled much lately just because I don't tie any money and jobs somehow, but I'd like that"
"I guess my dream job would be a photographer who would be fantastic for national geographic,"
"To or a huge photographer who travels, that would be great, but anyway, yes, I travel a lot"
"in the new places new faces new experiences I become restless very easy, so it is nice to be constantly in motion and"
"see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just don't get stuck in the same routine I hate the routine and worldliness of everyday life so it's beautiful,"
stir up things
"Oh, God, it's all right."
I'm trying to think
one of my travels
"I think we can talk about it, I don't know it's funny, although I've been one of my most memorable trips in many different countries"
"one of the trips I made with my family, I was a three-week road trip with my family, there are five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon."
"I know unnecessary to say it's as if you were so close for three weeks camping you always start on the nerves of others, but it was really fun and like when I traveled so many places"
I realized that it was like such a beauty in the American landscape and so we were around the southwest and the big canyon to zion to the great tetons to yellow stone and it was absolutely amazing to see that all the natural beauty so
um
and we saw a Grizzly bear black bear many bison a wolf and it was really cool these kinds of I don't know natural wonders also really surprise me because these things are not man made
"and as pretentious as it sounds after a while, Europe is somehow not getting old, but it's as if you know that you have the same idea as"
"white old white men build large buildings and artwork and it's beautiful and everything, but as you just kind of like okay I want to see something that is natural and beautiful"
or something that's different
Cool
um
"quite simple, as long as I"
Getting healthy no I always sleep so easy
oh grumpy and only very lethargic and little energy say not much and just somehow away in my own world
"I don't usually get enough sleep anymore and I've trained more, so it's kind of"
"Excite me, so it's not that bad."
That's good.
"I guess I was more negative right now, but it has to do with such circumstances as uh it's been about five months since I quit my full-time job, nothing else has found that really found nothing else I'm interested in"
so
"It's more like ugh, what I'm doing there."
"Yes, it's hard on the market and just like I'm very picky because I don't want to just sit in a little bit of my own cabin because I quit my job just for that reason, so why go back to another job just do the same thing I quit my other job for"
"So it's exactly how I have to pay for it that I quit my last job to get a better job, so it's kind of like I'm stuck in this section, just like living paycheck to pay"
"hardly does it and just wait for the right opportunity to come, but it's like"
"when I give up and sell my soul and go back to the company world of sitting in small cabins, I don't know"
"Yeah, it's hard, but I mean, I think everyone goes through the same situation after college so"
"But I guess it's hard because many of my friends because I went to a pretty good school and you know I have a girlfriend who teaches English in Afghanistan and I have another who has met the president you and one who teaches for America another girlfriend who is in the harvard uh school for how harvard master [mass] you know to get their masters, so it's kind of like ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
all this comparison and then here I am working a little restaurant job so
"I do it sometimes, but I'm gonna be hawaii next week, so right now I'm fine [Laughter]"
Yes
but yeah normally it was kind of like down because
I'm just trying to find what
"I should like you to know what I want to do next and how money situations that are very stressful especially if you have school loans to pay the insurance rent car loans as it is just food, as I can not even afford food"
"So it's just hard to live like this, especially after you've paid as much money as an amazing college education, so it's a little frustrating, but there are a lot of people in the same situation"
It's all right.
"No, I don't think so, but I mean"
"I think everyone's going through depression here and there, so I don't know if you can"
but don't diagnose how medically I'm not on medication
Yes
Yes
"Oh, let's see."
uh try many different things and don't be afraid to fail
"Because I'm one of those people, if I'm not going to be the best in something, then I'm just not going to try to accept the best or do anything or go home."
"So, I think I would have told my high school self that go and try a lot of things, even if it means I'm not the best in it"
so
Ten years ago
"Well, that would have made me like twelve"
I've done a lot of things I've always done.
I think I would have continued to write as much as I was younger. I used to write miniatures like little stories. Short stories for my parents.
"And I kind of stopped doing these things because it's like I'm not good at it, so I'm not gonna do it."
and I think if I just keep doing these things and trying to get you to know different classes
"I don't know, different sports I kind of grow up with football I don't just know"
"expand me rather than find something I'm good at and just stick with it, but never really try harder"
"kind of just like stay I always stayed on a level somehow, but as soon as I'm good, I just stay for good"
I'm not trying to go beyond that.
if that makes sense
"Now it's super lame, but I'm looking at t_v."
(Laughter)
but I have always read one on my time off or just listen to music or just take a nap
"or baking, but now it's like I'm standing on my feet all day interacting with people I just want to relax by sitting on the couch and lying and being like I'm done"
so
(Laughter)
That's a difficult question.
Probably the day I was admitted to Pomona College.
um
"I was a newcomer to Wellesley College, that's the women's college in the east"
and I hated it of how the second of how the first week I knew only that I chose the wrong college and I was like miserable for the whole year
and I just applied to a school to transfer Pomona College like that to Claremont
and
"I didn't think I'd come in and I was because it was like a four percent acceptance rate and I was like the odds that this is ridiculous, I don't think I'm coming in"
And I was like you know the thought of going back to Wellesley was super depressing
um
but then I got an email from one of the admission consultants I had met when I visited Pomona and he was like hi tatiana like
um
I just wanted to see if you had any questions about Pomona at the last minute.
"and I was like why would he email me the day we find out if we know you, accept you or not"
except I have the assumption and so sure enough a few hours later I got the email that I was accepted in Pomona and I was ecstatic that was like the best day of my life I was so happy
That's probably one.
"Yeah, that's good."
"It was fantastic, then I took my mother and my little brother for dinner and I went and bought me a few new clothes went and exactly how went crazy colored my hair pierced my nose I was as if we started this whole thing around [Laughter]"
"Yeah, that's good."
Vulnerable
Fun
Maybe moody that you never know what you get sometimes...
likely
Uh definitely friendly
and quite like a positive person
um
but sometimes maybe a little
"aggressive, but"
"for the most part I think positive things I mean, she's my best friend so [Laughter]"
What are you doing?
Really Happy
"Oh, when I was in Mexico"
good over winter
"No, I don't know."
my friend took me down on a sailing trip
san clemente and that was really funny and we just went like sailing and went around the missions hung on the beach that really fun
this was a good time
"Yeah, it was cool."
(Laughter) See you.
