Hello.
safe
well a little tired
indianapolis indiana
Uh I'm a singer
I like to sing
To diversity my girlfriend is uh
"from Taiwan, so that they are different cultures"
Transport
the
Crazy People
It's...
seems hard to get something really accomplished
< slaughter>
it took about six months to find out the directions
Twenty-eight years ago
a long time
I haven't been there for eight or ten years.
All right.
"I don't like my brothers, so I don't want to hang out with them."
I started my girlfriend uh we got over uh just went back from orlando and uh she likes to travel so
"meeting new people, seeing new places, uh helps me get out of l_a and get a different perspective"
"I just did the Avatar seminar, which is like a"
Raise your consciousness and clean up the crap in your head
< slaughter>
um
"Yeah, I feel better, uh had a lot of psychic attack and"
"it's uh I'm psychic, so it's very hard to deal with"
< slaughter>
um
"Well, um..."
There's more to life than what you see.
"many things are in other dimensions and in other places, so you need to not only deal with the emotions, but people uh direct energy on you"
um
must do a lot of clearing and grounding and
Stay true to yourself
I'm both
"Well, I'm introverted because I like to spend time alone"
and I'm extroverted because I like meeting new people uh times was totally introverted
Watch movies t_v read uh do crossword puzzles I'm a singer singing
Writing music I write a novel
It's kind of like the matrix.
to good I wrote the first twenty pages pretty fast
"So, um..."
I'm expanding it now.
I get inspiration uh it was actually a dream and then I wrote down the dream and now it's gonna be uh I could probably turn it into a movie
< slaughter>
"Yeah, that's good."
"If people don't respect me, that's number one."
"No, I just that my brothers don't respect me, that they don't really do it."
um
"You know I want to love my family, but I don't want to hang out with my brothers, so it's a conflict."
Exactly
"pretty good, I get angry only once a year"
to my girlfriend about two or three months ago
she wanted me to do something and I said no < yawn> and
I don't know.
"Yeah, that's good."
She's my girlfriend I've known for about a year.
Pretty close
um
once i
sang and
Scrubbed_entry
and I sang in front of an audience and that was great
um
"Well, I'm looking for ways to expand my consciousness so that I can have more money and more wealth in my life"
So I can uh
have my own house and uh live in my own creative space
< sniffle>
I sing I'm a singer so let's see how unforgettable so uh that's what I like to do
no
no
no
"Oh, that's the hard part I don't have."
"I don't know, maybe it's because when I was"
"a child who beat up my brothers, and"
I don't feel totally rested in myself or in my life like this
uh
I feel like... < sniffle>
I don't feel quite sure
"Yeah, that's good."
um
a little irritable
"but I've been sleeping better since I met my girlfriend, so it's not quite bad"
my what
Behavior What
I don't know.
"Well, I feel more positive I made the seminar and uh"
so I get rid of some crap in my brain < sniffle> and be positive about life
um
well done a lot of exercises uh
reduce my stress and much of my stress comes from uh judgment me and other people
"Yeah, you could say that."
< slaughter>
uh
All right.
< sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle> mm < sniffle
mm
I don't know it's hard.
<yawn> hard to cope with sometimes I mean way too critical for my own good
uh <sniffle> 
All right.
"watch t_v gets up, but"
<yawn> uh lately I feel like I have to
um
have less judgment and more fun
I did the seminar.
um
"It was about a week ago, I think"
"Well, I went to this seminar I got there, I was able to"
Lose work and be <yawn> < sniffle> in a different environment because my work is stressful and < sniffle>
my life is so stressful
uh <sniffle> I was able to take a break that is great
I'd say I'm going away fun smart
uh
but I mean in l_a people in l_a they don't want most of them don't want to spend time with you
I don't know if it's me or me.
< slaughter>
uh
that I spend a lot of time worrying and criticizing myself instead of making progress
Avoid it
"watch t_v or watch movies or try not to think about it, but it doesn't solve the problem"
"Well, a little bit I didn't pay my bills much, which I still owe."
It is a kind of self-destructive prophecy <proph> prophecy
uh stop criticizing and
Start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen
My friend was very helpful.
"Well, she's funny and she loves me and takes care of me and"
uh
<Laughter> yeah
to singer and I am intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and
uh
I'm a good listener
"Well, I've written about four or five books I uh"
"my voice that I think is number one, because when I started, I didn't have much of a singing voice, but now I do."
Goodbye.
See you.
