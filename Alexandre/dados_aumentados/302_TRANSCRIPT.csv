value
I'm fine. How about you?
I'm out of los angeles california
What a part
All right.
My whole family is friends here
a mix of people and much to do
Early Childhood Education
"No, not now, but I'd love to get back in."
Love working with children see them smile
um
"guess it goes back up when I was a kid uh I like to be happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life"
Working with children as a school teacher or in this capacity
"Yes, it is, but if it is a passion of yours, it will always be fun"
I'm close.
sometimes too close
I have four sisters and one brother on my mother's side and on my dad I have
"six brothers and four sisters and we're all intertwined, so that's why I say we're too close sometimes"
no
"I have a lot of friends I can interact with and uh we always do different things, so I say I'm not"
Curse
< slaughter>
Just let it out.
a few days ago my nephew
did not call me back
"A little crazy because I put some time aside to spend with him, and he just blew it away and didn't call me back."
"Yeah, I know."
I'm fine.
When my mother died
It's about
five years to the day
so
It's getting better.
Time makes it easier
Much
Because there are many things that make me think of them every day.
anything uh driving from a particular
Restaurant that she likes to watch uh shows different t_v
just everything that could trigger a memory
by my mother
yesterday
uh think about the good times and
I'm not staying in this place too long.
"Come on, think about it and go on."
"mm not officially, but I think I could be depressed"
All right.
"I mean, since my mother died, it's been pretty hard."
and then
"The work situation here in California is not stable, so that has a lot to do with it."
"Yes, it is."
Such a kind of kind just for myself
reserved
mm not really
It's pretty simple
Dimples irritable
Zappelig
just a big nerve ball
What do you mean?
"I guess, so yeah, I like to travel"
Meeting with new people
different places landscape
uh different ways to try something new at a new location
Uh just came back from Memphis three weeks ago
Go and see family and friends uh it was pretty nice got a chance
see around
something new

Wow
Keep to the plan and not
Go straight to the left or right
um 
"only different circumstances in life, which"
gradually pressed me to the left and right
every day
Uh a few relationships don't stay in school
um
Missing great opportunities with employers
To be funny
Loyal
spontaneous
Life of the Party

"I mean, there are others, but these two, whether good or bad, they're always"
in my corner for me
