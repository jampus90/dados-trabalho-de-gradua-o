value
Yes
I'm fine.
I'm out of los angeles california
wow wonderful weather around
Outdoor activities all the time
overcrowded pollution
the standard
I studied child communication
"Um, recently, I just..."
I'd say yes
Preschool teachers
"Well, I've always worked with kids since I was eighteen, so I figured"
"doing something to help someone, it doesn't pay well, but you invest in the future"
"Wow some job I could get paid to be out all day, get well paid to be out all day"
Yes
"I'm kind of quiet, but I'd also say I'd say borderline I like activities outside, but I mostly do some kind of activity probably by myself, so yeah I'd say I'm an introverter"
light
Uh wow just to maybe a racist or disrespectful person
"I somehow shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I come to other people, I can't change someone else's personality, but I can use my own work"
I'm pretty good.
"I don't usually argue with people I usually disappear, I mean, an argument doesn't solve anything."
"Wow it's a lot of things I regret, but it's nothing I can control probably the biggest regret was losing my mother"
Thank you.
I was extremely close to my mother who I am as a person who made me as a person
"Wow, twenty ten years ago, I'd say don't be so angry."
"excited all the time about things I can't control, I'd say to myself to relax and"
Don't be so hard on myself
"I think this is pretty cool, I think you should have different ways to deal with different people"
<clear throat> no I have not
No I didn't
Yes
less than one month
"I realized that I have to judge myself as a person, so I can't really look at someone else to help me unless I start with myself."
"No, I don't know."
I feel like a person like an individual I feel like I'm able to control things myself I feel like
to seek help is good for someone else it is probably very good for other people I have worked with this population of p_t_s_d around
"Veterans before, so I know it helps many people, but I don't feel it's for me"
it's not difficult at all I've always been like a loner trying to treat my own problems and situations
"a little depressed, but I think everyone has a little sadness in them sometime"
Day after day I have just started an exercise program so I try to look at myself
for the solution
"always known since I was a child things moved me differently from other children, so I felt like I was always different I felt like I was ever"
"understand me as a person then I would have to work on myself, so yes"
"around today I have to see my best friend after a long time, so I feel lucky coming and going, but I felt happy today"
"Wow, he would say, really silly about"
"But when I'm near him, I try to be happy, I try to present a situation in which we both will be happy that no one wants to be around a depressed person."
Scrubbed_entry
Wow
"I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I'd say I'm loyal, I'm reliable."
"I would just say that I'm trying to be there the moment I'm not a person who's really fat flashy, excuse me, uh flashy or in materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded"
"Oh, my mother"
By far my sisters
uh my mother was a school teacher who made me become a school teacher and that's basically what I'm doing uh my sister has been at her job for forty years so I've always had a stable influence in my life
"Wow, I'd say"
just on a sunny beautiful day talking to my mother I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately
Wonderful
Wonderful
"I like to go out and play sports, I play four or five different sports and I like to take a walk, I like to ride my bike, I like to get out and be active"
"to have such a wonderful mother, I mean, I have to go on to this subject because"
We are introduced in this life and this is our first teacher who is our first teacher and it will be our teacher for a very long time and I am simply very grateful that I am very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother
