value
yes
i'm doing pretty well um
i have some stressful circumstances going on but um
um right now i'm i'm engaged
i'm from minnesota
mhm
uh thirty one years ago
half my life
um
frequently i've been back there quite a bit
um but over the years not not that often
um
well it's a a whole different experience you know i i got back there to see my my family and and old friends and uh
so it's uh
l_a is
is home it's nice to return here
uh to be an actor
uh i'm just actually getting around to it i
was in another business for uh
twenty five years and um
now <clears throat> finally i can't put it off anymore
um the economy um it's as easy to find work in uh show business it seems as
it is any thing any of the other jobs i've done in the past
um oh a whole variety of things um but mostly uh having to do with theater
uh
well to to be a successful actor you know would be nice and
uh outgoing
with elements of shyness
um
well i i
i read and i cook
and um
um
that's mm that's about it uh
uh
i oh i'm a big radio listener is uh to uh
um talk radio uh
national public radio and uh
more uh
and not uh
crazy stuff um the sensible
listening uh nice content uh interesting human interest
uh mhm
oh um
well i'm i also i i
um
a comedian <cuh> comedian and so i like to listen to radio shows that have comedy
mhm
like uh
um
i'm pretty good i mean i'm not perfect but i i i i can get very upset
oh probably with my wife about um
my uh
<clears throat> methods of of job hunting and like that
it's um
it's difficult um
she uh um
we're we're very different and uh have very different
m_o's and uh
so uh
uh
for me to uh
um
do things my way is is not always easy
oh um
well just the other night i i was uh performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to uh introduce myself to a
a very famous person and i um i didn't do it
um
uh i'm not sure i'm i guess uh
i didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him
hm
i can't think of uh
i can't think of one um
um
well
i've been married for it'll be twenty four years in uh july
which is a couple of months and um
uh my wife and i have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years
and um
but we have a uh
a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school
uh this this spring and um she's just a
uh
gotten accepted at a college that she
wants to go to with a very nice uh scholarship
mhm
um yeah well
uh <laughter> my daughter's been very low maintainance for me um perhaps more so for my wife but she's always been uh an excellent uh
uh child
um
mm
well we're more similar i think than different uh i'm well i'm much more uh
aware of
what's happening in the world and and much more informed than my parents were
um
but uh as in terms of child rearing i think um
i don't know we're all we've all been kind of hands off and um
uh my wife has been more hands on
um
uh well the financial responsibility it um
wanting to uh
make sure that your child has everything that
her peers have and
uh
not wanting her to uh
um
not have the same
as her friends
and she has uh
very wealthy friends so that's um
uh
i am not a uh
a gifted money maker
and
so uh it's a it's a a struggle but uh we we we keep on keep up
um
oh a couple of different um
one preacher um
uh whose church i attended for about twenty years until he died um
um was very influential and also another
spiritual guru uh
um
that uh
sort of
put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that uh
were kind of dictated by my upbringing
oh just um
well instead of working for somebody else being able to um
start a business and and be in business for yourself and and to uh
um
you know not be dependent on uh
um
just one source of income
oh
meeting one particular woman um when i first got out here
um
she left me uh less than healthy
um physically
and uh
yeah
um well i
i self medicate to go to sleep
which i probably don't have to do but i um
uh about half the nights i i wake up um
much earlier than i would like to
oh usually um just mostly to have to go to the bathroom um
um
well i i i
cope pretty well i i guess i'm just not quite as functional as i'd like to be
um there are a couple of nights a week
when i work until <sniff> two o clock from in the morning and don't get to bed until three and and then i
um
normally if i i i need seven hours if i only get five or six then i'm you know sluggish and
um
very anxious
well um i have
big um
uh i have bills to pay and um not a lot of income coming in
yeah it's um 'cause i don't like to
fall behind and
um i feel like i'm
worried about losing ground and um the stakes are are high and
uh
so
uh
it's an uncomfortable position
no
um i am a classic um
depressive uh
and um
yeah i guess i have i i guess i have i see <s> i do see a therapist and uh
um
though <clears throat> mm
the mm therapist i'm seeing now is not trying to um prescribe drugs
or medications um and uh
previous ones have
uh probably
um six years ago
um
well my wife kind of pushed me into it um she thought
um
it was uh a way of
i think getting help finding work
and um
it's
not as uh it's just uh
good <g> uh uh
enjoyed uh having someone to talk to
um
not really
yeah
oh um
just uh
kind of
not wanting to uh
face the day just kind of wanting to
um
just uh kind of a weariness with the struggle uh and um
just uh i
displeasure with my life
yes
they're what
i don't understand that word
oh um
well i
um
it's
something i look forward to because um
i i feel like i'm
talking to someone who um understands me
mm
um
i i can't i i don't know um
um
well
each little um
acting gig that i get makes me
happy but uh
you know just mildly happy and they usually turn out to be disappointing experiences and so um
uh i never
over
excited <ex> excited
um with happiness uh
mm
um
well um yesterday i i made a a dessert uh to celebrate my daughter's uh scholarship and uh
it was delicious and and we really enjoyed that
mm
um
hm no um
except meeting that one woman
uh
uh
i don't know probably
try a little harder you know <fidgeting with mic>
uh
i had started this business um
um
around that time
and um
it was it was um just it was difficult but uh we were successful at it and um
uh i guess i could've gotten it
rolling even more
um
so that it wouldn't be so um
dead today
oh um
getting out of town um
going
going away when uh when uh which is rarely possible but uh
yeah
um
well my daughter's a great source of pride and um
um
the fact that i've been
pretty successful in uh my endeavors
um and now i'm just uh
going for the the big
the big apple
and uh
uh and i hope to be successful there too
okay
you're welcome
goodbye
