value
sure
i'm doing good how are you
chicago
yeah
about twenty five years ago
yeah it's been a while
actually i haven't been back <laughter> i like l_a
i like l_a
mm it's a big city so it's kinda similar but the weather is not the same so gotta love l_a for the weather
<tisk> family i was a child
it took a little adjustment but not hard
um the weather
um
i can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't wanna leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't wanna leave
traffic <laughter>
not really but i've traveled <tra> traveled a little bit yeah
seeing new places different people the way they live their lives
<tisk> um i went to monterey california earlier
last <la> or the middle of last year that was very nice
um
it's a good question
i'm not really sure
uh there's probably
i can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think uh it's kinda weird but <laughter>
astronomy
yeah it was
<tisk> i don't know just kinda fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kinda just went down that path
no
there's not much job opportunities so
it's kinda limited
yeah it does <laughter>
um my dream job
i would like to own
a restaurant
a nice a bar restaurant
well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than
most places you go to
or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of
worn out run down so
something nice something different something creative
something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd
but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible
i'm definitely more shy
but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but
initially i'm pretty shy
good idea
um a lot of times i
try to just
lay back and you know do some deep breathing
just kind of clear your mind
or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book
kinda just takes your mind away
relax
i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now
learned that you shouldn't
react immediately to situations you should
you know think before you speak that type of thing
um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago
um
we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and
wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so
i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate
frustrated
like
yeah i guess
everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that
you know
of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves
<tisk> but yeah
mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion
um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know
or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh
you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or
that type of thing
leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago
i went to school in san diego and i
immediately wanted to come back so
i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that
mm
i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i
i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so
employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others
so not be so much of a burden to people around me
it's good
it's very good
we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so
it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well
could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good
<tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper
um probably irritable there's
it's harder to do tasks
it's kind of like you feel like you're being strange or something because you don't have as much energy and
good
relatively well
spring time always makes everybody feel well
no not at all
never
<tisk> um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy <sigh> it's probably been a while
um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy
i wish i was more
i guess
stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less
so
i don't know
i i guess that's
the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad <laughter>
don't really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you should've done something
um i'm just gonna stick to that
argument with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she made me feel pretty bad <laughter>
um
i
i don't know uh when i was
when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and
i drove
my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that
but
that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now <laughter>
stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>
<tisk> um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends
that've been positive influences
yeah
mm a caring guy
nice person good heart
a little
a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to
make himself better and
uh passionate i guess passionate in a good and bad way <laughter>
well i care a lot and at the same time
sometimes it gets the best of me
mm
<tisk> sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that
you're doing more than
they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated
so that's an example
yeah probably but i can't think of anything off the top of my head
<tisk> um
focus more on school
because while you're young you have the ability to
multitask
and
scrubbed_entry
mm
<tisk> i don't know
really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i don't i don't know
um i i i cleaned up a bunch of stuff from my room so it was nice to shed some old garbage so that that was alright but i don't know if i really enjoyed that but
i felt content after it
mm
i think i could do better i feel like i'm an underachiever so not much i don't know
i'm very detail oriented organized
i like to finish tasks
um i care a lot you know i'm very caring um
i have good intentions in mind i don't like to wrong people i don't like to lie because once you lie one lie leads to another so i don't like that
but yeah that's
that's about it
<laughter> cool
right on have a good day
