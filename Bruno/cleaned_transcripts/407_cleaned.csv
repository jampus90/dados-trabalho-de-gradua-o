value
yes
<clears throat> i'm actually feel <f> i feel pretty good 'cause i uh
i slept
all day yesterday almost and i usually i'm doing something if it's not work it's school if it's not school
it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school
i only have school on the weekdays
so i actually slept probably like
eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good
but i'm actually kinda tired as well and i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today
i'm originally from bakersfield
california
really
uh i moved to l_a when i was an infant and then
i left here when i was around three or four
and i've been move i moved back here
in oh seven and i've been living here
um ever since
um
wow since i've been here since oh seven i've only been back maybe <clears thoat>
maybe like
a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer
like in oh
eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here
unfortunately
uh <sigh> uh <laughter>
uh it compares to l_a
um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i
anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um
l_a has all the stuff to do it has um
oceans and it's by all kinds of um located
um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh
san diego and what have you not so <s> um
but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss
like the actual city
i just miss uh some of the people that
i grew up with
oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of
california like six times so
i would like to travel
once i uh
have enough money to do so
um
well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker
and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um
studying <stu> i was
took i took communications and uh
did general ed stuff too and um
took like video production classes and um <tisk>
did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking
and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back
here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento
but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be
uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done
with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and
become an optician so
but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans
and i still actually i got into um playing poker
a few years ago and i really like
the idea of becoming
a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are
extremely difficult to make a living out of and you
have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then
hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere
to be an optician
oh um
uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but
it just like specifically
trains you into um
one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and
all these other classes like you normally would do for like um
like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field
i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si>
it sound like something maybe i could do
it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually
um got my attention to be an optician so
i'm now trying to be an optician
and it's interesting so
it's fun it's um
really hard but it's interesting and it
and it um
and it's it's fun it has um rewarding
um
rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see
better and feel comfortable with
glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel
more comfortable with
cool
uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy
sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because
talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon
or uh animated or whatever <laughter>
so
cool
but no usually ninety eight percent
um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe
this might go for some of the poker players too um
i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like
um i actually
playing poker is um
actually something that
helps me forget about anything as far as like um
stuff in the past or present
um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela>
i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy
thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past
i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however
playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um
catch twenty two or whatever but uh
yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball
i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually
one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does
um it makes me feel good
but it i didn't go
i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the
cold season
so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter>
um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like
i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and
all six of 'em were started by the other person
so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but
talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like
thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been
a couple times maybe in the past where like i
wasn't able to control it
but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would
but for um
majority of the time yeah i don't have like
people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um
on the freeway and stuff but uh
oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really
um petty things i guess that maybe we just
i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh
we just bumped heads too much so
obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so
we just argued about
girlfriend boyfriend things
uh
um
i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um
handled differently
there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh
uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and
i was um working for
scrubbed_entry
production assistant for filmmakers around
um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned
and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment
and then i got involved with like uh the wrong
group of people i guess and
kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment
so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with
those kind of people that kinda of girl
um uh
ever
uh because <clears throat> i woulda
probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason
and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh
<sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um
not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so
you know
mm
hardest decision i guess
i guess uh hardest decision
the hardest decision i have ever had to make
would be um
i guess you could say uh i don't really know
was gonna say that uh
maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like
stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh
would like to be with her and miss her
but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like
i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and
i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that
i don't think it would end up working out anyways so
i guess the decision my hardest decision would be
to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her
and uh
be uh not with her so
i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um
i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been
happier in that way but stressed out and
um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so
it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it
not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me
or whatever so
cool
oh what was that
i beg your pardon
nevad
i don't understand the first part of that question
oh an event
oh an event okay um that i could erase
uh event that i could from my memory
uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her
my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w>
we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard
so
i guess both of them
oh it's extremely easy i could fall asleep
anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would've been weird because i guess i would've
fallen down or something i don't know i just caught myself
i guess i was really <r> i mean i was really tired but i i do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep
as much as i would like <l> like but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever so
as they say
<tisk> uh no
no
uh lately i'm just tired but i'm alright i guess
i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month an a week
but it's actually it's not i mean i've had worse things happen i mean worse things happen
had worse things happen so yeah
i guess
well i'm a religious person i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so um i obviously even all of it even devoted
people to god um regardless of what they are they uh sometimes lose faith so i do lose faith sometimes but it doesn't really last for that long and i know that there is a god i know
that i'll be okay and that everything will be okay but you know it's hard um deal with them i i don't really i just keep going you know go to school and work
and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just
try to stay busy and
staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping
a lot helps but i don't get to sleep a lot so
um i don't know
uh playing poker
playing basketball
deals helps me deal with it and like uh
hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes
why
uh uh
uh i felt really happy on friday because um
i went to san diego for the first time
and uh i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it was gonna be but uh we were like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so
i would've much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i was had fun and i was
happy about going to san diego for the first time and i um
had a good time
oh
she's
um <laughter>
a lot of things but i guess i would say like
be nicer to like um
family members you know a couple family members that i wish i would've been
different to um
acted different to not that i was like a horrible but i could've been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh
i would've never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did
like high school and different part times of out of high school i would've just
really focused on um schooling and stuff and then
did the partying later uh wouldn't have gotten relationships that um so i would've just told myself more basically to be more
uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh
stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but <sniffle> um yeah i just would've done a lot of stuff different but
i um i don't know if i said this earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason
um
so i guess everything's happening
now for a reason
so i'm just gonna keep going
uh
<tisk> i guess they would the few that i do have or few that i used to have 'cause i have best friends now a couple i guess one new one
and i've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like went out own ways but i guess they would all probably describe me more as like
um happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy
uh loud uh
silly
uh smart
and uh
i just in i guess in uh in general just like
entertaining to be around
have
i haven't always <a> always been the best bestest best friend but i try you know my hardest
so that's it like
cool
um <sigh>
change myself uh
<tisk> i wish i was um
<xxx> i wish i was like fifteen pounds lighter
um
i wish i didn't need
uh
how do i say put this uh i feel like
um
i feel like i'm a i feel like i
i need to be like in a relationship with a girl
i feel like i wish i didn't have to be
like feel like
that i needed to have a girl all the time
and so i could that could help me like focus more
and i wish that like i didn't need
sexual um
i wasn't always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like
me having to be in a sexual
thing with them like
as far as like wanting sex as much as i do 'cause i feel like
if i didn't concentrate or have to do
like get be with girls or in a relationship to like
well who i don't know how to say it but i'm just saying like i there's like guy friends that i know
that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need <n> need it as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit
where like i i could focus on more things other than just
i mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like if focus on if i didn't want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get more stuff done in my life
but
yeah so i'm trying i'm working on that
<deep breath> <sigh> what am i most proud of
uh
i'm most proud of
<makes sounds with mouth> the the
i'm most proud <prou> oh i guess i guess i'm most proud of working for um television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of um
film sets 'cause like i
i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then
two years later a year and a half later basically i got i started making steps to become a filmmaker and then i ended up working <wor>
working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really
really um
really um
good um cinematographer a really good um freelance cinematographer that was based that lives in sacramento they did a lot of things so i'm proud that had a dream and i went for it and i and actually ended up doing stuff to go towards my dream that were in my dream so
um yeah i guess that's one of my biggest accomplishments which was like
over ten years ago but i you know hopefully
something like that could happen again soon or you know so
perfect
goodbye
