value
yes
oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so <laughter>
i was born in canada
and but i've lived in california most of my life so
and it's grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish
the <laughter>
oh my gosh years and years ago
uh not at all i don't think i've gone back there <laughter> for a long time
well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so
travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost prohibitive so
uh huh
oh let's see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather <laughter> not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that
it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and
but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with
so
mhm
why did i move to l_a because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and
this became our home base and uh
that's why
easy very easy so
uh huh
uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it's they have designated courses and then after that
went to college and i was a business major let's see i was a veterinary major <laughter>
and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so
um
i don't know
can't really pinpoint why <laughter>
so
i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate
i'm a leasing consultant part time
i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives
oh
probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at
t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter>
but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so
but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals
so
i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet
you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social
oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um
take a walk uh call my friends
million things <laughter> so
i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody
cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so
mhm
mm
i can't really remember
so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i
avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so
i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of
mm
i can't think of anything right now
i
really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard
i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision
so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but
since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and
that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider
mm
yeah
an event
hmm
well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever
so i know when my father died you know i mean
i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more
but
you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with
that
so
mhm
yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh
philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives
so
well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do
um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot
i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them
so
mhm we have a small family
uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many
types of kids out there i think
majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control
but um
i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very
well-behaved so can't say much else about that
well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um
uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but
they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes
run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't
yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting
ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll
kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so
i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter>
but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of
you know
taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's
i can't say anything to her about that
so
yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know
at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but
for now you know that's i'll deal with it so
tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but
the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so
you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep
mhm
uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm
i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean
so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that
i um
i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know
whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of
creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies
and
you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so
no mm mm
no
i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person
and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so
hmm
can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so
no i never regret anything
uh huh
what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it
everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um
you know seems like <laughter>
uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um
wasted time with certain people um
i don't know those are the things that come to mind
maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things
but
mm
outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh
i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so
mhm
well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but
i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and
um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we
you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so
that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah
mhm
i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter>
but uh if you want i'll repeat it so
um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable
uh
i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener
and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm
don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so
hmm
that's a hard question <laughter> the
can't think i mean i'm
can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter>
for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um
i love going out with my friends
shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips
um
that's kind of
you know
part of it yeah that i mentioned so
traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it
um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries
uh the architecture
it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place
mhm
okay well <laughter> i've um been
to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can
whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um
each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are
there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um
kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international
and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's
but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so
uh
yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college
that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and
um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um
so yeah that's
mhm
yeah
mhm
thank you
goodbye
