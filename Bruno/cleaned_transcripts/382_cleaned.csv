value
sure
i'm doing fine
i'm from columbia south carolina
yep
uh two thousand four
yeah
uh once a year for christmas break
uh a lot slower paced
more xxx
i wanted to perform <perf> to pursue a film degree or i'm sorry a film career
yes
it's pretty challenging but it's uh fun
uh i've always had a interest <inter> interest in uh film and movies so uh it seemed like a natural pick for me
uh took about a couple of years
but uh
i feel like i'm pretty used to it now
uh i like that uh it doesn't snow it's warm weather
and there's lots do to with a lot of beaches
uh the traffic
and the cost of living is pretty high
i've never been outside of the u_s but uh i would love to at some point
uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance
i like uh listening to music uh doing crossword puzzles
reading and hanging out with friends on weekends
uh very good
hmm
uh
i don't think it was argument maybe <may> maybe a difference of opinion so it was more like a debate
but uh it was pretty pretty tame
uh i think it was a
debate over sports
over a basketball <ba> a basketball game
and uh
i was talking on facebook with somebody about it
but i think it's good to
uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh
it's natural to you know
not always agree on things
so
i think talking <ta> talking about is healthy <hea> is healthy
i have a very good relationship with my family um i get along with all of my family members and extended you know cousins and aunts and uncles
so uh
there's no one that i i've ever had any rifts with
hmm
with my family
hmm
i probably could've been more disciplined growing up
and
more
uh
more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kinda thing
but for the most part uh i had a i had a good childhood and uh there's not much i would change about it
hmm
probably leaving my comfort zone in uh south carolina moving out here that was pretty
hard but at the same time it was
uh exciting
so it was it was a bittersweet feeling
um
a lot of excitement mixed with uh some anxiety but it uh
it went away pretty quickly
sure
not doing better in school uh when i was in high school
uh definitely i could've been a a <ss> um more diligent worker and i could've uh applied myself a little bit better
hmm
i've always had a strong support <s> uh family support system
and uh parents and uh siblings
so
that's definitely a positive thing
hmm
an event
uh
probably going back to school i wish i would've uh
wish i would've done better in school so if i could take something back from my past it would be
uh scholastically <sch> scholastically related
it's pretty easy
when i don't sleep well um
i tend to be
kinda lackadaisical and uh
just tired throughout the day kinda groggy
uh no everything's pretty much uh the way it usually is with me
i've been feeling pretty good
uh no i have not
uh no i haven't
last time i felt really happy um
i made a lot of money uh a few weeks ago and uh i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so
i'm still kinda have the lingering effects from that happiness
yeah
uh
when i
when i have money i tend to be a lot uh
more even-tempered
not even-tempered but i tend to feel better about things
and more optimistic
and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game
and to have uh
xxx have sources of income
uh
i think i'm creative
and i think i'm a good listener
hmm
to be as disciplined and focused as possible
because once you're out of your
parents' homes and out of their lives you have to
depend on yourself and the better the better you do in school and the better you are um
uh as far as discipline's concerned the more pleasurable <pleasur> pleasurable your life will be and
a lot eh uh
your life will be a lot easier
hmm
let's see here
i wish i was more
disciplined
but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better
at that
it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older um i'm out of my twenties now so
i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here
hmm
um
some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but
uh i kinda take insults in stride and um sometimes i welcome
constructive criticism
'cause some some things are wrong with you that you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited and it's coming from the right place
i think it could be an invaluable uh tool you know listening to what to what other people
have to say that might be negative
hmm
uh probably optimistic and
um
outgoing optimistic and
uh helpful
my ideal weekend uh
i would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with with three or four friends
you know packed in the car and just uh lots of disposable income
and um you know good weather
uh i haven't been to vegas in probably five years but
um
i've gone to casinos with my brother and that's pretty fun sometimes
uh
i'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm uh a lot more disciplined
um
i read a lot
uh
i do crosswords
and i think i've
i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want
hmm
i'm not a big fan of high taxes
um
but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and uh
i guess i take it in stride though
uh
i had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun
it was a documentary
a sport <s> a sports
sure
goodbye
