value
yes
pretty good
i grew up in boston
about thirty years ago
yep
not too often
maybe once a year sometimes less
oh i love living in l_a i don't ever wanna live anywhere else
well i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and
the weather was good and
that's part of it
uh very easy
well maybe somewhat easy the beginning the first few weeks was really hard
to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great
broadcast journalism
well it's something i'd wanted to do since i was twelve
and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream
no <laughter>
well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was
in my twenties and
it just
once i had done that work i realized that's not really what i wanted to do it was too
cut-throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me it didn't make me happy
yep <sigh>
my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries
<deep breath> well the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them
it
i used to i don't travel so much right now
i love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like
where i'm from
my favorite trip is i went to australia for my thirtieth birthday
'cause i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday as i crossed the international date line
and i went to this really small <sigh> place up on the
uh west coast of australia called shark's bay where native dolphins live and swim
and is very isolated for the most part and i got to be there for a whole week and just really just pretty much by myself
with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you
and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world
more shy <sigh>
<deep breath> why <sigh> hmm that's a good question um
partly the first thing i think of is 'cause i've always been that way
but maybe that's an excuse i don't know um
i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people
so <sigh>
i watch t_v <sigh> a lot
or that's probably not the best alternative but it is something i do
and i also walk on the beach 'cause i live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax
<deep breath> pretty good
it depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good
<deep breath> um i don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations
but not at people directly <sigh>
i don't know if i feel guilty about anything at the moment
not sure i have one at the moment
<deep breath> noise other people's noise makes me really mad
um i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and
not considerate
about their neighbors that that just makes me really mad <sigh>
yeah <sigh>
hmm <sigh>
well the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo
it felt like a really hard decision at the time
you know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it
um so that felt like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision
but at the time it was really difficult to do that
pretty easy i sleep pretty well <sigh>
<deep breath> for the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money <sigh> at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great
but i it's 'cause i am worried but you know i'm also confident that things are gonna work out
nope <sigh>
nope
hmm <sigh>
i don't know i can't remember
i mean i don't feel
super happy all the time but i don't feel unhappy either sort of like just uh
even
keel
well i got to go to the um
my friends work at the motion picture academy so i get to see all the xxx oscar-nominated movies
scrubbed_entry
she was there one night so uh i really enjoyed catching up with her and
seeing her again so that was very pleasant <sigh>
<deep breath> i think
they would say um reliable
and
loyal <sigh>
and
considerate and thoughtful
<deep breath> no <sigh> i really have worked hard on that
i think
there are lots of things maybe i would do differently but there's nothing that really i regret
um
<deep breath> well i just think that there are things
that
um <sigh>
like it's not worth wasting the energy
to think about things that i regret
so i don't have a lot of xxx regrets about things
<deep breath> oh that's a good question <sigh> um <sigh> don't worry about the small stuff
and save more money <laughter>
like
well there's uh you know the normal things like i'd lose more weight and i would um
uh <sigh>
think be a little more fearless maybe <sigh>
be a little more bold
i don't think i have any the of those
<deep breath> well i'm i am self-employed so i work all the time <laughter> so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients
um
that's something i enjoy
um
so that would that would be ideal at this point my weekends if i were really busy
<deep breath> that i've really been able to take care of myself and that
you know i've done pretty much everything that i've said that i've wanted to do
i've done that
and i don't and i don't have regrets about things there's nothing really that
eh
is un feels undone
in my life sure there's plenty of things i still wanna do
um but
i feel like i've done what i said i was gonna do
<deep breath> yeah <sigh> that's not so great well it's okay um both my parents are deceased and i have a sister and a brother
um
i feel closer to my brother than my sister but um
they both live on the east coast and i live in l_a
um and then i have <ha> my sister has two girls
so i feel very close to my nieces although we don't talk as much as we used to 'cause they're teenagers so
they have other things on their mind
<deep breath> um probably my teacher
a person i learned my holistic body work from
i really like to <sigh>
model my work and my way of being after him
like he's a a good role model
for me the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life
<deep breath> um we're pretty close we're not you know best of friends but i do i know that i can call him any time i need him
um <sigh> put me in a good mood <sigh>
usually being with my friends or going out to dinner
or um <sigh>
yeah just spending time with my friends
okay
thanks <sigh>
bye
