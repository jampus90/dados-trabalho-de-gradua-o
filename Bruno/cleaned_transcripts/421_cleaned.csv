value

how are you <laughter>
originally i'm from san francisco
um originally i moved here in gosh nineteen ninety five
then i went to chicago
then to san francisco and then back to los angeles probably about five years ago
a lotta moving <laughter>
never
um
there just isn't anything there for me anymore
uh the weather is better in l_a
but the people in san francisco are nicer
my husband prefers <pref> my ex-husband prefers it here that's why we moved
i have an undergraduate degree in psychology and uh after that i went to law school
uh when i was in college i worked at a law firm
and decided that i really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting
no now i'm a stay-at-home mom
scrubbed_entry
no
um
i love it but it is it is
difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they
become
a good and successful person
uh <sigh> i it's easy to kinda do the academics and stuff like that you know i'm good at that the hardest thing i think is to guide them
emotionally
to help him through things that he's having
a hard time with um feeling like i don't have all the answers
um just seeing them grow and and experience new things and
learn about life and the world it's just it's really really cool
uh completely different <laughter> um
completely different i and i am not a perfect parent but i love my son i take care of him
he's the first priority in my life and they weren't like that at all
um well my parents are dead
i didn't speak to my dad at all before he died
um i have a sister and a brother that actually i don't know where they are i don't speak to them either
um
probably more shy because i consider myself more reserved
um i like to listen to music
i have i listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when i'm relaxing is uh eighties music <laughter> cheesy cheesy but true
um it depends on who i'm with if i'm with my son
i can control my temper
um
if i'm with
my ex-husband or other adults mm yeah <ye> yeah i don't
so-so
um yesterday
and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married
um
i found out he was cheating on me and i kicked him out
and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her
yeah
um
really angry
and just really hurt
um
i wish that i had
talked to my dad before he died i wish that i'd settled our differences before he had died
the hardest decision i've ever had to make was actually
ending my marriage
because he was cheating on me
um
that would have to be
well i don't know i mean i don't know if i'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me
who i am today
so i i can't really think of one event that i would want to erase
uh i don't get a good night's sleep it's not easy i wake up a lot in the night
i don't know i wish i knew <laughter> if i knew i i could change it
i could try to do something about it but i i just don't i don't know
um
grumpy irritable
uh grumpy irritable um
down
mixed with anger <sigh>
it's
just because of everything that i'm going through with my
soon-to-be ex-husband
yeah there's
um
i just keep it inside
i mean there's nothing else to really do except <exce> i mean it is what it is so
i have to
deal with it
no
yes
<deep breath> ten years ago after my son was born
or nine years ago um
i felt like
i couldn't cope with life
i was so down um
i couldn't i felt like i couldn't do anything
no
i don't go to therapy i go to medication management
but i don't <d> i don't do talk therapy
i have gone to therapists and no they don't help
um
well some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything
um you know if i wanted to talk to myself i would
others give advice that i think is just
it just not not good and not on point
um
it was probably this morning i was playing with my son
just really happy i wasn't thinking about
any of the other crap <sigh>
um in my life i could just forget it so i was feeling really really happy
ugh
i think they would describe me completely different from the way i would describe me but
um
i think they would describe me as really sweet
uh 'cause they have really sweet um
confident
uh outgoing
because that's what i try to be to people so i think that's how they would describe me
uh i wish i wasn't sad i wish i was more confident
um
yeah there are a lotta things
i think
uh it would be
to not
not
give my life over to one particular person which is what i did with my husband
i think i would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like palm springs with my son
hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner
uh
one of my two of my friends two really good girlfriends i think have been really positive influences in my life
um
scrubbed_entry
she <sh> her life is worse than mine and uh <laughter> but we can always commiserate together
scrubbed_entry
is just really positive i mean she's always happy always up always looking to the bright side so that has helped me a lot
my son
um i went over to a friend's house and we had movie night we watched a grown-up movie and had dinner and wine
and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening
mhm
sure <laughter>
bye
