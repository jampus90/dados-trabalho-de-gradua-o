value
yes i'm okay
i'm good i'm a little tired but i'm good
michigan i'm from michigan
um
a long time ago
then i left
uh
once twice a year
cold <laughter> very cold
because i wanted to pursue my acting career
uh
well
it wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity
it was the options
more options
uh the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy
<sigh> let's see
besides the weather
i like that
things are more convenient
i like some of the people here um
<laughter> that are actually from home but um
yeah i i just i like i like that it's a little laid back
that's about it
i don't like the traffic
i don't like um
uh the gang violence
in certain areas and i don't like
<sigh> what else don't i like
huh
maybe that's that's all i don't like
i don't oh you know i like i don't like that it's so far away from home i wish
i wish l_a was
kinda midwest <laughter> i wish it wasn't so far from home
i have a close relationship with my family
um
it's a small uh immediate family is really small
and we're close my grandmother recently passed so it's um <tisk> an adjustment right now
but i'm close to my family
well i can't see your shoes but i do travel often
i do travel yes
um getting there <laughter> i like getting there um once i'm at the wherever i'm going i like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and
people
uh okay i oh i went to um france a few years ago well many years ago and a little town called carcassonne and was very um
it was it was actually really fun but very much like a story book as far as what i expected to see and what i actually saw
like i what i remember that i really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there are no windows in the buildings but
they are these shutters that most places in the united states have inside of windows they have them outside of the windows and there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool <sniff> i like that
i'm borderline
sometimes i'm shy sometimes i'm outgoing it depends on who  and what the situation is
um music i turn on music i walk
through the neighborhoods you know
i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not a
um hot head at all
hm
oh it was an ex roommate
and it was about my loyalty as a friend
yeah um pretty much she um
thought that because i wanted my rent
which she agreed to pay
that
i was not
being a good friend that i should just let her live for free and
that wasn't going to happen
so you know
the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway
even after she didn't pay me
so that's a friend
i could've kicked her out i didn't
she left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but
you know
could've um
could've could've been a bad situation but there was an argument there
a real a real one
i wish i had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when
we agreed to be roommates temporarily
and
um gotten my money upfront
that's what i wish i had done and i just i didn't my mind told me to go along with it
no my mind told me to get the money upfront
but i didn't
so
mm
the hardest decision
um
i think i have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like
<tisk<> maybe um leaving home
leaving home when i was years ago when i was like eighteen
yeah
um
i felt like i was abandoning my family
<laughter> that's what i felt <laughter> but um they encouraged me to go on and live my life
mhm
uh something that i could erase from my memory
probably
a friend
who
i was um
uh dating
i would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when i told him my grandmother um was ill
um it's easy if i'm busy all day and i'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so
it's not that easy actually it's not that easy
i'd have to
because i have to
be exhausted
i have to be exhausted
to be exhausted
no
it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long
irritable
up and down
up and up and down like sometimes i've
been excited and anxious and on the other side i'm like
mm
what am i doing
yeah it's just an anxiousness to wanna make some things happen
some goals
and um
uh
getting certain kind of work
and
um having a certain amount of um
income
and uh
just taking care of myself you know the way i think i should
take care of myself just the physical stuff
eating right and everything
yeah
i have
um sometimes i have a lot of
distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what i need to be focused on in the moment
and i'm conscious of that i'm like of all the things that's popping up in my head why am i thinking about that
uh i i let them happen and then i i try to think about other things and
phase it out it pops back up i phase it out
yeah
no
no
uh
when the roommate moved out
i was really happy when she finally left
um probably reading
and maybe go out go dancing that would be ideal i can go dancing go salsa dancing
and yeah
mm
my ability to make a decision quicker
and to act on it
really badly
uh i don't know if i have a time that someone has ever made me feel really badly
i don't
feel bad about
much
uh
as courageous
that would be it in a nutshell
in general
um
i regret not making some different decisions when i was younger as far as
moving forward with as far as um career stuff and
um relationship things i wish i had done some things
earlier in my life that i'm doing now
uh really going after some of my personal goals and
um
deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long term and
yeah i wish i had done that earlier
twenty years ago i would have
giving given myself the advice to
um
continue
with my schooling
um beyond what i did
and
to be more discerning in my choices of individuals who i allow in my life
um
being a part of the family that i'm a part of
thank you
goodbye
