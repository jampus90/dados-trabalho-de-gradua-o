value
hi
sure
alright
uh originally originally i'm from uh korea
mhm
uh when i was a year old
yes
uh almost never i've i've been to korea once
uh i love the weather <sigh> and being by the ocean and the culture has a lotta things to do the food there's a lot to like
um
the traffic um
it seems like
we're having a lot of uh economic difficulties and the
the parking tickets are super high i sometimes i'm really
annoyed by our government <laughter>
by your shoes
did you say by your shoes
<laughter> your shoes aren't showing um i have traveled a bit i'm i'm sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while
oh just <sigh>
it um
it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here
um it's exciting and it makes me feel like
um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that
you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day
well um
one of my trips i went uh
i went to
singapore and then to thailand
and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um
he had <ha> he was uh
uh
a sales engineer
or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days
and that was really interesting um you know of course
eh
it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something
but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and
um
after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really
it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really
there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing
but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle
we went to um
phuket it's a little island
and it was just it was very
primitive compared to
singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap
had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>
it was interesting yeah
yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>
mm
well i'm in school right now
and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um
i had health problems
so um here i am i'm
i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c
yeah
i'm happy
ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian
but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and
in in a veterinary capacity
yeah
i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and
how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not
yeah
uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping
um
i like
like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand
or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or
a lotta times i can just lay there and
my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing
ah really good
i don't have
i would say there's certain things that um
they can really
like make me
like when i see injustices or things like that then
i mean i can really feel it
but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or
uh even you know yell <laughter>
argued
um <sigh>
i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument
like if we just
well
uh i would say last summer
when
um
i think it was after a
baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to
we went to have shabu shabu after the game
and
i don't know i think
scrubbed_entry
and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like
mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her
um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any
deep problems but um
sometimes we just have
she's very touchy
and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do
so i think
she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm
you know i just kinda
that's just how she is
and then i guess i said some things that she
felt were
eh well she gets really
offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we
then one day she called me up and then we were friends again
but like she never she never confronted me
hardest decision <sigh>
uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend
uh well
it wasn't
it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it
for like five years
um
you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just
had a lot of um
we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements
so i had thought about it and thought about it and
we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so
i don't know uh
i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally
eh we were just always having
um
we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um
we were just having these little snippy
disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and
um i did
it was really hard it was it was the hardest
decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um
and
but i i think it was for the best
<deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job
for well to help my friend start a business in nevada
and when i when i
i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach
and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome
and that was really stressful for me because um
i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't
for her wanting me to come over there um
it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left
and um
when i went over there
like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah
when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and
the other principals of the company were um
you know the <th>
it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much
and also
they were a different religion
and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh
eh i was kind of an outsider there and then
also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>
so i would say that's one decision it it's
it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um
i really wish i i had just stayed
<laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say
my memory
like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase
is that what you're saying
mm <sigh>
can't really think of anything i mean
even like that
that bad decision that i made
you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something
and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't
being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but
i never feel rested and that's um
it's a medical problem of mine
well i always feel
like i haven't slept for two days and
um
there are points in in the day
i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and
and rested but they're short-lived
but i sleep a lot i sleep
uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy
yeah
well thanks <laughter>
no
i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um
that's
that's usually what doctors
um
like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and
figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep
but i do
i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well
my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down
um
i would say that i do feel down sometimes
a lotta times but it's not
i would say
it's reasonable considering
the situations that i'm in
uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult
but um
i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular
oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've
find some great new dish i like i mean
what type of happiness are you looking for
um <sigh>
well
i mean right now um
my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week
um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though
we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um
you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone
um yesterday
'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal
<laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean
you know there's little fun things like that
uh <sigh>
probably um
o_c_d <laughter> and um
she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her
um
i think that she would
say that i have a good heart um we're very different
um
and probably that i'm
i should ask her <laughter> uh
i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun
um but
she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that
why um
i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now
and <sigh>
so i don't really
tell people about them
um
it it's kind of a
it's kind of a killjoy but also
people can feel i feel that people can feel
less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of
um
it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before
even before this difficult time in my life i've been
i've been a private person i don't know why
i think <thi> i think a lot
eh you know i'm a deep thinker
and
maybe it's just
you know
not like i feels like i feel abnormal but
um
maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that
don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure
ten or twenty years ago <sigh>
um
well one thing that i regret right now is um
you know i haven't really found
somebody
you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder
that's it
um i would say <sigh>
that i've perservered
i'm very proud that
even though i have a lot of
difficulties in my life
the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school
and i'm doing it on my own
and um
you know it's
it's kind of a
if people if people knew all the problems that i have
they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um
i really feel that
you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's
thanks
mm k
thanks
bye
