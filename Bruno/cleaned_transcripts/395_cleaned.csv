photography and language studies
mhm
um i love photography
i was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well so i wanted to continue to learn more about it
and with languages i come from a mixed background so i wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic background

um seeing different cultures different countries um
meeting new people all of that
and the language
um i lived in greece for um <tisk>
over a year i taught english there and um <sniffle> i moved around to different parts of greece and uh really had a great time
i think um
just having my group of friends that i met there and going through with the experience with them
um i think one of my most memorable experiences was going to elafonisos in a car with everybody and um and having a just a fantastic time
yes it was
um i think i'm shy to begin with and um and as i get to know people then i'm much more outgoing
photography and language studies
<deep breath> um i just stay at home uh maybe watch a movie um
rest in bed
watching a movie in bed that's probably one of the things that i like to do to relax
i think very good <laughter>
um it was probably with my boyfriend um
uh regarding money issues
um i need to i feel guilty about not generating as much income as i need to right now
i'm having some struggles in my career right now
and um financially it's becoming very difficult
yeah it has been it's been difficult but i've been working very hard to um to remedy that <sigh>
so well i'm here and um i'm doing this this focus study i'm doing um many things to generate more money working harder but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my my career
um
probably being raped
no
no
sometimes
um not that i'm aware of
<deep breath> um i been feeling stressed <sigh> um
i been feeling um
<deep breath> been feeling stressed and and worried
i don't seem to have any problem with it <laughter> i seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night
mhm
um grumpy and and lethargic and um in the morning
hmm a situation i wish i would handle differently
um
i really can't think of one right now
<laughter> the hardest decision um that i've ever had to make
it was probably um deciding to not have a a child
well um i was pregnant um and um
wasn't sure <sigh> whether or not i should continue the pregancy um
and that was also due to financial burden and um
the father who i was involved with did not want the child so i made that very very difficult decision
hmm
i know when i went to um cancun um on a holiday um over the new year um new year period new year holiday
<deep breath> i felt <sigh> absolutely fantastic i felt happy i felt relaxed um
i felt like i didn't have a care in the world temporarily
um
eh free
um i wish i could um
be a little bit stronger and more assertive
definitely more assertive
um i would say i'm a wonderful wonderful friend
um
mm i when i love somebody you know i love them very deeply friends family um
boyfriend
um so i think that's good i'm very loyal as a friend
um i'm honest i care about people
um
i'm fun to be with so i think those are some of my best qualities
<deep breath> um my relationship with my family um with my father is not so great
um my parents were divorced when i was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever
uh mostly out
so that's um it's not fantastic but um but it's something that i'm used to so it's not
as painful as it would be had he been there and then i lost him but it's it's still it's still um
it's still not the best situation i mean i still wish that could be um remedied somehow
scrubbed_entry
so there's good and and bad relationships in my family
scrubbed_entry
someone that's been there for me since i was very very young
and has always been just incredible and i love her so much
<deep breath> um ten or twenty years ago um
i would've told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so i don't have to work so hard now
i i regret exactly that i regret um not taking my career seriously earlier on
um because now it's it's been um
it's been much harder
um
i think it was taking the kids to the pier um and spending some wonderful time with them
and making them happy
that was probably a great time um one of the best times in the last few weeks
scrubbed_entry
and uh
and they're they're great kids
um no i think the they're it's challenging
um it is more difficult because they're stepchildren so there are some um
times when i'm not sure exactly how much um to get involved and how much not to get involved
but i'm we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but um
but i but it's not as difficult as um as i think some other parents have it
mhm
um i made it make a make a conscious effort
not to um
<laughter> not to punish them um or over-punish them
i make a conscious decision not to um scream at them the way that i was screamed at i was screamed at a lot as a child
and um it was really it was really difficult so i make sure not to do that
um i think i'm most proud of the fact that i've um been able to
travel the world um
and live in other places many many other places um around the country and around the world
and um
the fact that um i learned several languages
um
and the fact that i've been able to maintain um
really long long long relationships with my friends
thank you
goodbye
