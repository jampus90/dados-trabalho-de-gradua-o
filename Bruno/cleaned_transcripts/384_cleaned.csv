value
yes
i'm doing fine
indiana
yes
uh i don't know maybe ten years ago
never
uh just don't like the cold weather
l_a has beautiful weather and
activities all the time
new life
uh reasonably easy
the good weather the ocean
and there's always something to do
hm uh
the traffic
sometimes
seeing new places uh and visiting new people
well a couple years ago i went to the catalina islands for my birthday
i was i spent the whole day uh on the catalina islands
i took a boat there
uh
hopping on the airplane and leaving indiana for good
okay
sleeping
uh
being a filmmaker
because it's one job i haven't had yet
not too hard
shy
hm
because of my past
um i
just have trouble making new friends and
just let <l> trusting people
okay
uh watch t_v or go to the movies
i really don't have a temper
when i was sixteen my stepfather
uh because of uh nightmares i was having
i was just having nightmares about my childhood
about my involving my biological father
so far i have no idea if they are or not
uh go for a walk or drive
uh maybe a few days ago
uh just walked around the block a few times
pushing people away
uh i guess
try to trust them a little bit more
let them in my life little bit more
well that'd be easy that'd be the first half of my life
it'd be easier to start a new life if i can't remember my old one <laughter>
uh
really i mm all my decisions is not that hard i just try to avoid stress and everything so i don't really have hard decisions
uh
well every time i push someone away i wish i handled all those situations differently
uh well uh whenever someone gets too involved <volve> involved in my life
i always say or do something to make them want to stay away from me
um this
depending on the type of person they are
uh i really don't have a relationship with any of my family i know i have a sister someplace in vegas
a half of a brother in indiana
uh my stepfather's in arizona
other than that i have no relationship with any of them
um
we really don't talk
so it's kind of hard to talk about them <laughter>
edgar cayce
well he died way before i was born and i only know him from like books and documentaries
uh really not that easy um
i
usually <use> usually take me like a few hours to get to finally get to sleep once i lay down in my bed
uh well basically i try to lay down i have stressful <s> racing or stressful thoughts
a few times i might even try to listen to music for one hour just to see if it calms me down
stressed out
and just yeah just basically a little stressed out
well i've been feeling a little bit lately <leet> a little bit upset and
just wish my life was different
uh well i wish i had friends and loved ones and all of that and i wish i had an actual relationship and everything but i don't
well lately i live <li> i move we moved a bunch of stuff <st>
things out my stress <st> life stressful things like
bills and what not
and just  try to keep
uh
to make sure there's the least amount of stress in my life by
just
removing just different things out my life and trying to incorporate new things
yes
i i guess we're number sixteen
nightmares
uh stopped a while back because it was getting too stressful
well basically i just
i just pushed like i got rid of them out my life because i didn't feel like they was really listening to me or anything
and uh
yeah so i just didn't feel too much beneficial help from them  so i've been looking for alternative means
uh well just basically like music and
going forcing myself to go to like different social related events
yes
depressed
mm just but basically just depressed uh keeping myself locked in
not talking to anyone
uh
uh i guess a few days ago
okay well basically
i feel that the best way to keep people in my life is
having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars
and user names and everything and
i just have some uh fun
going into virtual worlds with these avatars
and talking to people that way
so they don't know who i really am
they don't even know my real name
okay well my ideal weekend uh let me see
is uh if i'm not working that weekend i will get up maybe go to like starbucks or a mcdonalds
get online while eating or drinking something
maybe play a online multiplayer game for a little while
and then later on in the day maybe go to a movie
uh whatever's playing then
uh go someplace else relax watch some t_v
um
and maybe put on a d_v_d movie and
um
or i might spend the day i the whole day driving to someplace i  haven't been before
or it's been a long time since i've been
just try to spend the day in that area
and just
yeah so that's the weekend
my life
i just regret how my life turned out i wish i wish i had a more normal stable life
uh
let me see ten twenty years ago
i was especially
uh
i would just tell myself to keep a journal or something <s> uh or
to basically
tell myself
how my life will turn out now
so that way hopefully the other me will make different choices
uh my mind
well i wish i wish i was a bit healthier
i wish i looked a little bit better i wish my eyesight was
a lot better
and i wish i had a bunch of people in my life that i could call friends
um
i'm a freaking genius
i could
uh everything that i'm good at i learned self taught
so basically i can't get a career in that type of stuff unless i go to school for it
but
it's hard to
it's basically easier if i teach myself than like take some type of a class to do it
and everything 'cause
yeah basically <bay> yeah just basically
the fact i'm a freaking genius okay
thank you
have a good day
