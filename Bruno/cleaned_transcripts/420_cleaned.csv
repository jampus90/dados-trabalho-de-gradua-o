value
mm
yes i am
um i'm okay
chicago
um back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit
haven't been out there in over fifteen sixteen years
um
kinda got stuck out here <laughter> then i had my baby and i just stayed
uh
different food um
the people get along way um how do i get it it's kind of a culture shock
uh
out there just on the food basis they like to give you a lotta food
that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they wanna go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lotta money so they just making money <laughter>
um
mm parent had business out here
um
not hard
i could get used to anywhere
the views and the ocean
uh
just uh
a splitting of people that's it <laughter>
um just a few places
getting to see different people and learn how different people get along and interact with each other
<laughter> um
uh
i remember a trip years ago where i went to mexico with my brother
yeah
um
jumping into a lake <laughter> pretty much off the side of a mountain <laughter>
yeah
everything
there's not a subject i don't like
um
actually my dream job
working with computers and helping people
that's
where <wh> where my heart is i like computers and i also like helping people
i meditate um work out
i run i walk
um
i write read
in the median
mm
i'd say very good
oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good <laughter> um last time i argued
was
over someone actually spitting out a racial slur
towards my um wife
angry
upset hurt
disrespected
and especially when i went up there to treat the person actually i was treating 'em with dignity and respect and trying to help the person at first
it's no problem people are people
mm
i had a chance in school to really go a lot further than i did
and i let something very small
and meaningless stop me in the pursuit of it
um
ignorance
<laughter> for lack of a better word
now that i think back on it i could've done a whole lot to avoid it but i was just young and foolish
to start living again
um
as much pain as i've seen in the world
um
a compilation of all the events uh just different bad things that i've seen
i
if i could change it i would but
sometimes
i guess things are there for a reason
even though we may not understand it
um
i have no answer to that
um
blood family we really don't talk um
my wife
don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not
she thinks that i'm doing everything in the world but that i'm not
and really <laughter>
i don't understand
i know my daughter loves me but i don't know if she wants to be with me or not
because
when somebody talks to you
when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in they voice and the belief in their eyes
if you say something so many times it's what really lies in your heart
<sharp inhale> so you could say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there
hmm i love my daughter
she a angel i cut her umbilical cord
i went out there and <laughter> put on her first shirt
i seen her come out
she looked at me right out the stomach <laughter> she wouldn't she was fighting with the doctors wouldn't let 'em touch her a bit
i talked to her i told her to calm down or i told her it was daddy she looked up at me grabbed my fingers and like just calmed down and just let 'em do everything they needed to do
no it's constantly changing task um
what you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that it's constantly um
what is a better word for it um
<laughter> um
adjusting
um
the hardest thing i'll probably say
is
scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for 'em not xxx learn the wrong lessons
<laughter> seeing your baby smile in appreciation
i try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees
um
when i was younger there were a lotta things that i seen that no child or adult should've seen
and um
when <whe>
i grew up
i swore to myself that i'll always take care of my child and
i wouldn't disappear or
let her be around things like that
um
my old foster parents
mm
they basically showed me no matter where you come from
you can always strive to get better
um
a good night's sleep
eh um it comes
the same just tired and yawning <laughter>
how have i been feeling
mm
like
i have a wealth of queries and
a wealth of gold
within my
grasp and it's just right out of my reach because i just need that one
connector to really just
see what i'm capable of and i know i'm capable of a lot it's just
i need to make that connection
no
um
mm not p_t_s_d no
uh
i said yes but
i don't figure i'm any more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking points
my daughter's birthday on the twenty sixth
um took her out to chuck e cheese she had fun she played games she was on bikes <deep breath> she was crawling through puzzle games um
man this girl did about everything <laughter>
um
fun loyal caring
um
something to change
i would like to be more accurate
not getting to know who my mom was
stop thinking about whatever else has happened and just do what you need to do
i'm positive i'm goal-oriented
determined
um
i'm very imaginative very creative
<laughter> ideal
i would probably
be doing a little bit of everything
rock climbing biking
hiking going with my daughter places um
<laughter> man
i'll probably be skiing snowboarding and everything <laughter> in a ideal weekend
my daughter
no problem
goodbye
