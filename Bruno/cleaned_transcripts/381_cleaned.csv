value
yes
okay
from santa monica
uh the people
mostly
uh no not a lot
well i can't afford to travel as much as i'd like to
mm i was an english major
uh i just liked reading a lot at the time so
it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study
no not anymore
oh i guess my dream job would be to
manage a uh soccer club
oh it'd be pretty much impossible for me
um i don't have any experience <laughter> in that field
i'm very shy
i play music
<sigh> what do i do when i'm annoyed
i don't know
um
what do i do when i'm annoyed
i can't think of anything i don't know
i don't think yeah i don't do anything specifically
uh pretty good i would say very good i don't lose my temper very often
mm when was the last time i argued with someone
<sigh> i can't remember uh
yeah i don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i argued with someone
well let's see when i was um
a little kid
i was outside my grandparents' uh restaurant
and there was a robbery and i saw it i well i saw it when when the robbers were leaving
um
yeah maybe i would want to erase that from my memory if i could
well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel
so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then
um
you know my mother was upset by it my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was
it was disturbing to see her
you know really disturbed that way but
at the time that it actually happened i wasn't really upset it was more the the aftermath of it
mm it was <wa> it was
<sigh> situation that
i don't know um
well i can think of um there's probably a million situations that i would've <laughter> i wish i would've handled differently i can't think of one in particular
um
maybe
i think that when i was a kid i um
well i think that when i was let's see
well i have okay i have a good one
um
i didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married
so
that's a big one for me
yeah well
we <w> we were together for about four years
and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didn't uh commit
and um
that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that
that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other
but because
my selfishness and because i just uh
had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh
i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been
well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was
no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend
as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh
how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't
i never feel like i can help anyone
who i know who has a problem so
oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone
all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't
feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know
well they're um
it's very distant it's it's just
it's very cordial and it's very uh
uh i don't know what the word is it's on the
it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all
and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense
so
yeah it's it's
i think a lot of families are that way but it it is
it does bother me that mine is that way
oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um
yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all
no not not really i would say
they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so
even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and
no i don't think i've i've changed much
mm pretty down
but like i said
in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again
i've always been this way so
it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way
yes
a long
oh a long time ago i was um
about ten years old or
around there about
uh i was just missing a lot of school
i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to
to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh
it went from there
no i haven't gone to therapy
since i was a teenager
well
i didn't feel it was helping me at all
so
one day i just
decided i didn't wanna go anymore
eh
uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um
so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much
no i wouldn't say
disturbing
no
mm
well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew
and uh i have a
my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them
uh my ideal weekend would be um
i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would
really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um
eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city
uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and
how they interact with you and how they see the world
different food
um
and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a
historical significance
oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um
the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding
and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town
um
that's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was
and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so
yeah it was a really cool trip
<sigh> like i don't know i don't <laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable
uh
a memorable experience
probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be
nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now
that we should've
gotten married
um
that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because
it's it's still with me and um
eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any
mm particular day or any particular moment you know
oh a lot um
wish i could be healthier
for one thing uh more energetic
and um
more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly
but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social
um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more
and healthier
oh that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think
i think he would say that i'm
a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person
and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish
um
and probably he would say that i'm creative also
<sigh> wow
well my advice to to myself
i don't understand the question <laughter>
yeah but we already talked about it
nah i can't uh well i don't think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride
um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of
any accomplishment
anyway even if i did have something <laughter> to be proud of no i can't think of anything <anythi> any sort of accomplishment i've had
uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed
well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine
<laughter> and i don't usually do that but
yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago
thank you
