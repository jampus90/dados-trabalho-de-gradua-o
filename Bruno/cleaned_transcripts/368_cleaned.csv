value
yeah i'm okay with it
um i'm okay i'm okay um
i guess
scrubbed_entry
i'm basically an l_a kinda guy
cool
um
you know the weather it's usually pretty sunny and and temperate you know i like the the climate really a lot
uh i like the girls here you know um
i like uh let's see i don't like the traffic you know but
um i like the hispanic population quite a bit you know um
and i have a lot of friends here so i guess you know i don't wanna be anywhere else
i mean like i said the traffic you know i was on the four o five you know that's always kinda you know crummy
the cost of living that's really you know terrible about l_a it's always expensive
and um
you know i really don't like
<sigh> i really don't like you know the the
like it just seems like um l_a's one of those places where like you're you know you either have like a a you know a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you're down in the you know the ghettos you know
i have i've been to a couple places um
uh you know but very brief you know mostly it was for school
um i went to arizona and new york and montana lot of the anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that
um nothing i'm doing in right now
uh i like getting away from um <laughter> the city you know i was in yosemite last year you know in the summer for vacation that was kinda nice you know yosemite was really um
really neat to see but uh just basically getting away from the city i guess you know getting away from the job getting away from um the stress here
uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics um
i'm a big kind of a political you know junkie you know to begin with so i naturally kinda fell in line with that kinda field of study
i was i was but i lost my job
and you know that's kind of a bummer you know um i lost it's uh
geez
it's already been maybe a year and a half by now maybe two years and
um
you know the economy uh got bad and the budget cuts got bad
and you know um i wish i was working there again
uh
well i um wanted to be a lawyer at one time i wanted to be a lawyer and i um
and that's why i took political science and i took a double major in economics
and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i i regret is i eh you know to get into law school you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats
and i studied for it like really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the xxx test and like a idiot um i didn't feel right about the that day it was kind of an off day
and you know it was like you know the big game at the superbowl you <y> you know i just um i don't <do> i don't feel like i did well and i canceled the test and so um
you know i kinda regret that you know
<laughter> tell me about it
um i'm not really shy at all i'm definitely not shy um
but outgoing i mean not one of these people <peo> i'm not flamboyent you know um i i'll talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind
um meeting <mee> meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like i'm you know dying to to dying to meet anybody <laughter> you know <laughter>
i guess
um these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar
um
uh yeah thank you thank you i you know i i should've i should actually be doing more of it
but i also like to exercise um uh i'm on a diet right now but my diet's been terrible time the eating habits have been terrible
but the exercise part is just great i love to exercise <exerci> i love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is like run and like work out
um i just wish that my eating habits were were in line uh or a little bit better you know
um <sigh> my temper could be you know definitely improved uh a lot you know um
you know a lotta times i i feel i'm one of these introvert types persons when it comes to like you know i don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever
when uh when i'm mad i really don't wanna be you know talking to people i don't like to yell i don't like to scream i don't like to hit i don't like to fight i kinda close down a lot i don't i just wanna be left alone
sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be
you know uh the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe i you know i just don't i just don't wanna talk about it <laughter> i just don't wanna deal with it
i kinda close down and shut you know
shut off for a little bit
geez
um
you know it doesn't happen too often
maybe with my wife
you know we were probably something silly who knows
who knows
um
the
thing i i mean i don't have a lotta guilt i don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know um
there are things that like you know um i call minor sins
you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty
um
let's see i guess
sometimes you know um
you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to
you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but
sometimes i like to like
talk to people i guess
you know
well that's a good question
i guess
i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently
i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that
and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like
get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do
you know um
and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way
well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way
which is kinda nice
um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly
um
uh she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control
you know she doesn't control it and like it like uh it affects her health and it always has me worried about her and like stressing out about her and and she could do so much to like prevent it and she doesn't and
um you know i have a good relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think
i think i have a ton <to> ton of of family and friends um
that get along with me pretty well actually you know
yeah
um <sigh> there are times well i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby
um the only problem i have
i think
is i feel
like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you you're just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh it's like a falling sensation or something like that
and it doesn't happen eh that often but it happens
and um but for the most time <ti> part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good
well right now generally i've been feeling um
worried and and anxious and um
you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today
well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her
but um
you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good
and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too
and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like
and um
a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess
well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate
so
um
you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower
all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way
i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just
more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not
you know um working towards you know the goals
you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um
you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem
like
<laughter> like i wanna like uh
do any of these like terrible jobs
i xxx it's you know it's it's
probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um
you know one of these things is like uh
i feel like um it is hard
but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it
you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it
and like uh you know
it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry
i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with
no
no
man
uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe
i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like
not even happy about that you know i feel like um
you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that
it just makes me feel good
you know so i i have these these
these times where i'm just you know feeling good
about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and
and uh you know
incredible that you know um it just eh
you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times
you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes
you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know
well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes
who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh
i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can
like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know
that if i got my you know diet in check um
you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um
my <m> my
my uh
i guess my my
desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad
and like things are so um rough that
you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like
it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like
to um <laughter>
<sigh> do things
the one thing i regret is is not
is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um
you know
not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like
you know just to um
just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh
i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like
like uh
i mean there is a this idea of justice and
and um and republicanism
and you know things that i really you know adhere to
that um i fall in love with
and that i don't wanna get away from
but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money
and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that
that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like
like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome
ugh <sigh>
i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe
um
you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i
you know regret on one hand on the other hand
you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about
and you know
i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid
i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that
i think that real people have you know
um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like
i'm pretty happy and content with
being you know the cautious you know
uh
i don't know
oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night
and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family
feel that i don't put a lot of
time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my
time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really
you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different
i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real
you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it
you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they
you know
if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor
i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness
i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like
i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um
you know uh
like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends
but it's the same time i i just feel like it's
it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a
a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know
gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me
and i you know so i just do these things you know just
um well there are a couple a things that i do like uh that i've good <go> i feel good about myself you know
um you know i ran the l_a marathon that kinda feels good you know
i've graduated from college that kinda feels good you know what i mean but the thing is i don't feel like
like that proud of myself
for you know those things alone like graduating from college
you know hasn't really made me successful you know what i mean
um
running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim
so they're like half merits
you know or like they're they're great you know lotta people maybe not half done it a lotta people have excelled further
but um
you know they're kinda like stepping stones that like
that um i've seal real new no
life <l> lifelong
benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that i've done
yeah yeah no problem no problem thank you for your time you know um hope you enjoy you know uh being in this computer
oh goodbye
i'm gonna press this button now
