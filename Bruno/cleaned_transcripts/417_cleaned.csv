value
yes
i'm okay
uh los angeles <laughter>
um i don't know <laughter>
um
it's kinda dirty but that's to be expected from a big city
um my the last class that i took was a sociology class um i'm not <n> i'm not really sure where i'm going with school but i'm thinking about sex education
i think that it's a really important job um
uh i feel like
uh because there's kind of uh
stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies
so i feel like it's a very important job for
the world <laughter>
i don't know <laughter>
no
um lack of funds
um it depends on the people but i'd say that uh generally i'm more shy
uh of course with people who i know well
like they're closer to me i i'm more outgoing
um play with my dogs
uh
i don't know uh if it's a nice day i'll go for a walk
um
if it's not a nice day then or if it's cold out or something then
uh maybe watch a show on t_v i like or read a book or something
i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper
um i can't remember i think the last person i argued with
was my boyfriend
probably last week but i don't even remember what it was about <laughter>
um
i don't think i really feel guilty about anything i'd say that i regret things but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret um
like i think guilt is more just like feeling bad
but regret is like
um feeling like you should've made a different decision and
i think that can help you in
to make better decisions in the future whereas guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <laughter>
um
i regret not doing better uh when i was in high school
um
uh
i mean not getting better grades
um
i regret uh
like getting involved with certain people in the past
but i mean i don't i'm not sure <laughter>
that's about it that i can think of right now <laughter>
hm
um
uh yeah i mean i mean in the past
uh yeah i could've made
different decisions
i mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but i'm not going to feel i'm not going to regret things that i had no power over so
um
i'm not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory
but
i wish that it didn't happen to me uh was uh the time that i was raped
<laughter> i can't really think of any hard decisions um
hm
i can't think of any <laughter>
hm
i'm not sure <laughter> i can't think of any
uh i have a pretty good relationship with my family um
uh not
i wouldn't say that i'm really close with my mother but i mean we get along well
and i'm very close with my sister we're basically best friends
um
hm
i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life
uh
because she was always able to provide for me and she always
she didn't i mean she made
like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it
and um she just did her best to raise me so
i think she was a big positive influence
uh it's been easy lately
uh sometimes i have trouble sleeping but uh
lately i have had no problems
um
it depends how long i've gone without sleep i can just
be anywhere from like
groggy to like um
really on edge
and like um
extremely tired <laughter> i don't know
um i have been feeling
pretty good i uh
i have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been
in the past
so
been feeling mostly pretty good
um i think that i've actually been feeling
happier lately
i wouldn't say that i'm like really happy all the time i mostly just kind of
like
um
neutral but i have been feeling
more positive lately
i'm actually not sure if i've been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
um
uh
i know that i i've been seeing uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like
since i was sixteen
um for depression
and uh i think my first psychologist who i saw for a few years
thought that i had p_t_s_d but i'm not sure if she
ever made a diagnosis
um
i'm not sure <laughter>
uh
i'm <laughter> i don't know
yes
um
it's helpful to uh
talk someone and have them kind of
um
guide you in
talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your
feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something
i mean
i think sometimes you can do that on your own but
uh
talking to somebody helps i think
um
hm
i'm not sure <laughter>
um
i'm not sure <laughter>
um
i'm not sure <laughter>
uh
i think i would spend it mostly
at home
um but it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit
and i'd play with my dogs and
uh
i'd probably have my boyfriend over
um
i'd eat food that i like
like only food that i like like my favorite foods um
watch
movie or t_v show that i like
um
just
kind of have like a relaxing time but
that's nice
mm
i would tell myself to uh
to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever
and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like
sort of lose interest and then
uh not do well
or as well as i could have
so i would tell myself to
do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more
than i do
and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship <schol> a scholarship if i had done well in high school
so i would just tell myself to do good in school
probably warn myself about one or two people that
turned out to be not worth my time <laughter>
um
hm
um
i think i am
proud of myself for not
being um
bitter and for wanting
to
uh
well i am kind of bitter i guess but i guess i'm proud of myself
for not being selfish and wanting to
um make the world a better place like 'cause a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to instead instead of dwell on them
i try to
um
or i want
to be able to make things better for other people
and as much as i wanna help i guess um empower people to make their lives better
bye
