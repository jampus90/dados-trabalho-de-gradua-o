value
yes
i'm doing good
i'm originally from southern california
i like the um downtown theater district i like the beaches i i like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day
hmm
well sometimes i don't like the traffic
i don't think there's really too much i don't like about l_a i really do like l_a though
no i i haven't really traveled in about um five years
oh i just haven't been able to travel um
i just haven't traveled <laughter>
<deep breath> um i like going to new places and seeing things i haven't seen before and if i can like visiting um
places like landmarks
well the last one i did was san francisco that wasn't so far but i got to stay in downtown san francisco and i got to go shopping
and i got to get on a um the street car so that was cool
xxx
well i still study i'm studying psychology
mhm
hmm
well <sigh>
i decided to go back to school um just pretty quickly so i went to junior college
and then when it got close to graduate i knew i wanna transfer so
i'd taken a a couple psychology courses and i decided i liked it so i just decided to make that my major
and it
i thought it didn't have a lot of math but it had
enough math <laughter> so
<deep breath> mm <sigh> well now that i'm almost done
i don't know if i'm gonna continue in that area
well what i wanted initially was to um <sigh> get into sports psychology but i'm not
quite sure that's what i want either
well
i could be shy initially but um once you get to know me i'm outgoing
<sigh> i think i either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on netflix
well just a good movie i like foreign movies a lot um so a lotta
right now i'm into um martial arts movie with subtitles so
i think i'm pretty good
hmm
you know i know
they're not really long arguments i don't know if they're real arguments i know i argued with my boyfriend um <laughter> 'cause he hung up in my face but i don't know why and it got solved pretty quickly so i don't know if it was really that important
wait i walked out without say oh okay
hmm
i can't think of one right now
i think
the hardest decision i probably had to make
was moving
from well back to california from oregon
well i was really young so i was um
nineteen twenty-ish and i was really by myself so that was pretty hard 'cause obviously i had to support myself
because it was really really boring in oregon so um i really like the activity here in l_a
you know i don't really feel guilty about many things
well i don't talk to them that much um my dad my stepmom live in oregon so i probably talk to 'em on the phone at least once or twice a month
and then when they come out here i wanna say at least once a year sometimes it can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often then i see them
um
that's about it but i'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well
yeah
hmm
well i've had lots of positive influences i think um
just regular people i come across you know maybe someone i've worked with maybe
um like oh actually my uncle he's a really good positive influence he um he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice
mm about <bout> life
hmm
you know i don't really think i've had anything that bad happen to me where i just don't uh
where it bothers me so much i have to not think about it
pretty <pret>
well i can't say pretty easy 'cause i work odd schedule and then i go to school but um
yeah if i wanna go to sleep i sleep really well though as long as i have enough you know hours
really really happy and good
nope
no
i'm always happy uh <laughter> gosh yesterday
um i'm just happy any time i talk to my boyfriend or if i go out and do something i'm just happy um i got off work i'm happy 'cause i'm done for the day i'm just really happy
um i'm on spring break i'm really happy right now so
oh i haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat
but the last activity
that i had a lot of fun doing was ice skating um in december downtown <dow> in downtown l_a
no i don't really have too many regrets i mean whatever happens happens and you know it was meant to play out that way
hmm
well um
i guess i would say don't worry too much about the small things um
even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and uh
you won't think about it six months from now
i think my
best qualities are i'm a happy person i'm a fun person i'm pretty easy to get along with i think most people like me
and i'm just a cool person
hmm well i wish i could study more i wish i would study more
i wish that uh <sigh> i would exercise more
and i wish that uh that's
yeah i think that's it right there
hmm
i don't think i wanna talk about that
hmm
i don't know i guess uh just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home i guess that's about the best accomplishment there is
thank you
bye
