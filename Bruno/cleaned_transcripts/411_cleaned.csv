value
sure
pretty good
new york
uh i moved to l_a in the seventies
but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places
of
um
i guess every few years but
i travel a lot so i've lived in
i've lived in africa i've lived in spain switzerland hong kong too
um different cultures food music rituals
uh
everything the smells the colors
makes you feel alive
excuse me
one of my trips
uh i lived in kenya for about a year um i'd say
i love horseback riding so when you're
uh viewing other animals when you're
kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great
seeing red orange fall sunsets and
riding along you know uh
seeing so many animals yeah
in kenya um
probably when i went to a
a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii
and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it
tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to
enter a masai village for the first time
uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same
twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai
and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be
uh
some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed
my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets
and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living
getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah
i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen
uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go
achieve it sometimes um i believe that
um
usually i well i make decisions very quickly
and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker
and i told him i said well in each case
you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's
hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one
and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy
mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure
even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time
and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy
uh pardon
you said you put your fish
what do i do when i'm annoyed
um <sigh>
<tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um
i guess you really have to put yourself
in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy
um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're
put in other situations where you're forced to
to um
understand other people's
lives a lot more regardless of how different they are
uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why
travel is really the best education there is
<sigh> let me think um
last time i argued about
something um
god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um
oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something
um
uh <sigh>
oh i know what it was um
it was somebody who belonged to the uh
uh scientology faith um
i uh
inherited
i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus
and um
uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive
and um
<tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited
and um
and he said something about are you aware of
past lives and
i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that
if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them
and i and he said that are you aware that
um
<tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that
many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have
had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness
um resulting from even your past relationships or your
parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that
you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself
even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold
maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all
and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge
i take
sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would
fold down i had my boo boo
and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part
you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child
and i would actually
even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back
i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital
the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that
just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh
um
uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that
because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and
it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was
um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen
twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have
never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has
you know
so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of
somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his
uh
you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated
especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery
uh the following week
and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get
into it but
one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused
by people themselves
and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that
past lives can also affect
you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are
are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought
he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so
but um
<tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't
you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>
but other than that i mean i don't
<sigh> um
uh <sigh>
sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when
when it's in terms of patience
i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital
mm <sigh>
mm my brother
uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he
is in the medical field so my sister and i said well
you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time
but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after
you know my boss my father kept
you know um
um you know bucking the his body would actually
be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard
mm but you know it was after a while the uh
you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular
uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible
yeah it was mhm
hm
mm
i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic
that happened to me that i've
had to block them i really don't know what
it is within my makeup which
doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that
have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of
that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear
and for some reason i i feel blessed that i
don't really i can't really even think of something that
i mean i've had some
bad situations happen to me but
it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me
in affecting
you know my behavior where i would
where i block it that i'm not aware
of something or i hold residual
negativity for some reason so
i really can't think of anything i mean
there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to
block them 'cause i've been able to
you know um
accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened
pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just
kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so
i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but
say like if i'm in africa and i
<tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my
elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem
okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh
have i ever studied <s> studied what
uh i could still couldn't hear you i'm sorry
have i ever studied changes <ch> changes in my behavior what was the word
um no
uh uh
um <sigh> i don't know just with friends and everything just even this
past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music
regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about
mm
you know it's funny
uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been
uh
um
opened up experiences that are
that are also great that i have not
overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner
to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and
sometimes people sat to me like
are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or
are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was
you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even
more difficult in a way um and uh
he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved
uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um
<tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business
i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why
i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see
the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten
to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g>
german
uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off
but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed
during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life
uh
a different world that
that would you know that i would've never
um had the chance
you know to
live through if i had not involved my
you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who
you know money isn't everything and
i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so
there you go
<laughter> and for example one of my favorite
times in my life probably when i lived in kenya
and you would think that
you know a lot of people have this
really bad vision of it maybe looking living
in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of
uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have
you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best
years of my life when i was living in kenya
the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen
um
to
live your life with passion
and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about
making decisions
you have to make those decisions gut wise
what will
give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy
and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield
you know the happiness in your life
<tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and
follow my
passions and
you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually
decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is
sure
bye
