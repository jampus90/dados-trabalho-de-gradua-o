value
yeah
i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you
uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley
yeah
uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um
the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um
camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like
eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that
that i i i would say i like that too
uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um
and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know
that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but
that's fine
wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter>
i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow
make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but
that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if
if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things
and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun
well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be
eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um
i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also
fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um
so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great
uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last
trip i i
took um
lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um
well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um
austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age
so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um
like
tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life
i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and
so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my
my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to
traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and
it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it
uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so
i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like
familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um
maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh
like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that
uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really
relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and
i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax
i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so
i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um
yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't
i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all
the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh>
i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about
things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict
as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um
really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't
sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing
something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um
i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um
i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not
even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or
running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait
waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true
um <sigh> hmm
um nothing immediately comes to mind i
well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh
was um
driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow
rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like
reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but
it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they
you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um
<deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened
it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck
well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh
i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up
'til one or two every night uh and
it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were
more um
able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven
and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to
going to sleep later and waking up later
i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um
you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh
um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that
no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um
everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening
no
no
well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh>
in my life uh yeah like i said i
i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i
there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh
i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we
we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life
i would say that um <sigh>
it's important to
to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um
recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from
the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um
kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which
eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um
that approach it's kinda fatalistic
and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that
it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of
you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place
um <sigh>
well i <sigh>
i i guess when people i i don't especially um
take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that
so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is
uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized
i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should
uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody
just out of uh college you know um
went over what we had done and
you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and
i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh
it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um
i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh
not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of
you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that
the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but
you know it wasn't our call <sigh>
mm most memorable experiences um
well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um
the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um
for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest
period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i
i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um
and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun
uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we
we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty
happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been
very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so
yeah
yeah thank you <laughter>
uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um
sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh
you know um
helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh>
intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh
i
what else i think that um my best friend might say that
uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i
also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans
mm
uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um
hmm <tisk>
well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that
um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um
my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh
i'd say maybe the fact that
it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that
no problem have a good day thank you
goodbye
