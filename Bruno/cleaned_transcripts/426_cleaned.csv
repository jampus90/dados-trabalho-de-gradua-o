value
<sync.
yes
i'm alright
south l_a
um
the weather
the women
the opportunities
that's about it
racism
police brutality
injustice
that's it
mm no
not much of a exploring type of person
um psychology
mhm
um
it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology
yeah
yes
no
to own my own record label
um
it it's moderately hard but you know
take it one day at a time just
i guess you know
stay focused
a little bit of both
um
i tend to be shy in um
situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to
and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with
yeah
um
turn the lights down low and listen to soft music
mhm
i'm getting better over the years
um
i think i'm
pretty decent now compared to how i used to be
yes ma'am
um
due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions
i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison
yeah
mm
i'm not sure
uh
i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life
um it was probably a few days ago
with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about
her lack of communication
and attentiveness
yeah
uh frustrated
because um
you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect
you know the same effort
by the other person when you're in a relationship
and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so
you know i guess i'm just learning
there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um
probably
the most recent was uh
i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation
with an inmate
when i was incarcerated
and that
made me
that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time
and um
if i handled it differently
i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner
than i originally
happen yeah
mm
there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory
um
probably
uh my first girlfriend
um
she did something really uh extreme
it wasn't necessary in my eyes
and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life
i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory
along with the good memories as well
um
a few you few
fights
uh i guess you could say shoot outs
um getting jumped getting robbed
you know those things i think those inhibit me
i guess to to explore
certain areas of life that i'm not
comfortable with so those are the feww things that
it'd be nice if i could erase it completely
yeah
hurting people that didn't need to be hurt
emotionally especially um
a few women in my life or in my past
um
probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through
along with my close friends and family as well
um used to be rocky
growing up but as i got older and matured
and
the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent
it's it's pretty decent
mm i would say my mother
um
yeah my mother
um
well she she uh she had her share of experiences
negative and positive
um i admire her
the struggles she's been through
um
she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up
but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age
finishing school getting her master's
and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well
and um
probably not the best of family
that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother
mm
it's not easy
so yeah it's not easy
i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues
um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil
but
it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like
it's a negative effect really
yeah
the medication <medi> i don't know shit
i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy
not good at all
um
yeah i mean
i recently got released from prison not too long ago
uh i'm older
now
and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be
i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life
you know
sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just
things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so
yeah
it's all good
yeah so true
yes
<sniffle> about
two and a half three years ago
<deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of
not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to
understand myself
how my brain works um
you know so i decided to seek help maybe
to better my life yeah you could say that
yes i am
yes
yes i do actually i do
mm
better decision making
um
better tools to reflect on choices
um how to control
uh
certain situations better yeah
um
<sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is
i step back and and and i assess the situation
you know to see what's what's the best way to to react
towards the situation
and by doing that
it has made me more mature
emotionally more mature
and just
has a positive outcome
um
i was lying next to a beautiful woman
who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most
happy
oh my goodness
spontaneous
um
outgoing
sometimes a little crazy
um
fun
that's about it
nothing
um like i said earlier just
you know hurting
the the few women that were in my life my past and
my friends and family that's about it
oh shit
uh school is really important
um
how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with
and what i choose to do in my free time
those are the few things i would tell myself
good music
um
a good game of basketball
um sex
um
i like going out
i like going to parties
um social gatherings
where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like
dancing beautiful women
a couple drinks that's about it
um
i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um
just just
i don't know
just keep going just just
not giving up really
yeah
mhm
bye bye
