value
yes
okay
virginia
i wanted to live somewhere different than virginia with a little bit more diversity
um once a year maybe
it's um
it's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there
um i wanted to live somewhere different and
a nicer warmer climate and um somewhere where there's a lot more to do and
there's a lot more going on
for me it was really easy 'cause i wanted something <someth> it was very different and i wanted something different
i like um
i like all the things to do like the museums i like
the beaches and the mountains and all the
hiking and all the free things to do
mm people don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and wanna take something but they don't wanna give anything back and
bad drivers
uh not as much as i would like to i
travel whenever i can but usually can't afford to that much
mm
well i like taking
i like taking pictures a lot and i just like
exploring new places my wife and i like to see um
wildlife and hike and
monuments and just seeing different areas
um
well <sigh> we
we've gone <go> we went to uh central california we'd like to be able to go
more internationally places but that takes awhile to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to
um
we went to hurst castle and to see the sea lions <li> the um
the
elephant seals and things like that
um
i guess our uh
i guess our palm springs trip for our anniversary we did the um
eh we did the tram and a nice hotel and jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall
i guess somewhere in between
english and film
well i uh
was told i needed to go to college and i hadn't quite decided what to do yet so i just
picked something i liked to do for the time being
well
wish i'd
not been pressured so i had more time to figure out what i wanted to i might've done something different like physical therapy but
uh no i've been teaching <t> teaching gymnastics which is something i used to do before
um
i needed to not starve
and
i did it i didn't end up being as bad as i thought it would be so i went for it and it ended up being kinda fun
dream is to have money and not have to work for it
overall pretty good
um
don't remember what about but it probably would've been
few weeks ago with my wife
um well anyone that i've ever actually gotten upset and
yelled i always wish i wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy
um you know if i just
saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening it makes me really upset
um <sigh>
i don't know i
i spend a lot of time on 'em but
i don't i don't know what the hardest one is 'cause eh if i decide to go with something it's you know it's usually for a good reason
well i guess i feel guilty about moving to california and that i left my family in virginia
i mean
<pft> i know i shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like
living there you know i'm the one that moved away so it's like i abandoned them
well i mean
i don't miss virginia but i do miss them so i guess a little hard
uh i have a good relationship with my <deep breath> with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there's
no problems everyone gets along well
mm very close
um
i mean anything <anyth> anything where someone gets hurt either uh physically or otherwise
it depends on how much exercise i have
get a lot of exercise it's pretty easy if i don't it's not
um
kind of like right now just a little bit
slow and out of it but
not really um
too different otherwise
um just kinda run down 'cause my um
my mother-in-law is is dying and we just spent like three days
uh in the hospital and we're gonna go back after this so not a lot of time to
sleep
mm
just um
just uh slower <sl> just slower and
more tired and
little more out of it that's all
no
no
um
usually just when i'm having <havi>
having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's that's pretty easy for me just getting outside and
and uh and hiking or exercising it's not hard for me
i'm not sure maybe um
maybe
mm like
eccentric but in a good way
hopefully
no
um
to
be careful with your
to be careful with your
job to make sure you could keep from being injured and to um
i don't know just your <y> just your normal
your normal kind of
uh older kinda wisdom <sigh>
mm not much to say really everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger
uh i wish i could get rid of my back injury so i could get back into shape like i used to be
that's um
the biggest thing right now
um
not much to say just hurt my back at work and
i just like to get past it 'cause it's
you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that's all
um well like i used to do uh gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now i can only work out a little bit 'cause it hurts too much
um
probably like during the
during the day going <sigh> going on a hike or to a park with my wife and
uh
enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then
at night um you know we watch a movie or go dancing or
just something like that
um
most proud of um
proud of moving here i mean i um came here without knowing anyone and
i was at a point where i could've stayed in virginia and gotten comfortable and
you know ended up doing something i regretted but i came out and i've always thought that was a good decision
mm
my parents my grandparents my wife most people in my life have been
bye bye
