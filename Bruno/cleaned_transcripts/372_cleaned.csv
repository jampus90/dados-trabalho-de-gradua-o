value
yes
um
pretty good kind of
<laughter> yeah
about los angeles
yes
the thing i like about l_a the weather
it's not easy to meet people
well it just feels like
people aren't out very much they're like that movie in crash where people are just sit in their cars all the time
um it feels like that
no
not too much
child development
well i have a son and
i wanted to know how to be a a good mom and so i wanted to know
about the stages uh that he would be going through
eh and be able to relate better to him
mhm
i am
kind of i'm trying to get it started again in the fall
i'd like to write
well
um i've written some children's books
and
i've just been doing research looking
into getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but
they're
pretty good i've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups
<laughter> it's about
a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries
to not become a jerk with them
and <laughter> it puts him in like a really
scrubbed_entry
he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life
mhm
um no
i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter>
um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing
i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter>
so
how do i cope
um <sigh>
well right now
um
i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so
that was the problem
it's so spontaneous
like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and
just brings a smile to your face
um
well when my son was younger
once we were just sitting around the house and
he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me
mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails
so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so
yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen
that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore
the hardest thing <sigh>
not wanting to screw it up
i feel a lot of stress and pressure
that
every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter
in what kind of person my kid turns out to be
and
so
it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>
yeah
yeah
definitely
um
hmm
i think
i'm different from my mom
because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction
i welcome it you know i welcome
getting to know who my child is right now
and
not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just
see them become the best
child that they can be the best adult that they can be without
molding them in that direction necessarily
into a different person <laughter>
so
say it again
who's someone that's a positive influence
um <sigh>
mm
i don't really have anybody
like that
okay
well
i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it
often enough
um
i've tried
to like go for walks but i don't always do that
and i don't always stick with it
so
yeah that's about it
i'd say
i'm
a little below average meaning
that i get angry
more than most people do i think
hmm
last night
<laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband
um we have my sister lives with us
and she lives with us in a very small room with
a small apartment i should say
and she's got four people living in in one room so um
it's kind of stressful it's really crowded
and my husband is stressed out about it
and
you know i'm just saying to him that
i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here
then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do
that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded
and every day they're asking for rides and my husband
he's
avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore
and i'm just saying that
he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because
he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter>
hmm
it does <laughter>
oh
i've got tons of 'em but right now
what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son
um
right now like
i've been arguing with my stepmom
and
my stepsister for a long time about
my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated
like they don't have any boundaries
and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child
they let my child boss 'em around and stuff
anyways because of this
they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that
yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom
because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different
ideas about child raising
she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife
and
she's
she really doesn't she's really far removed from
how i was raised and i wanna raise my child
more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us
and
with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild
and have everything that he wants
and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes
and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules
and not
trying to go and break all of my rules
yeah
um in that moment <sigh>
just really frustrated because they don't listen to me
i feel
disrespected i feel
like invisible
i feel
just angry
that
they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do
i went to school and i studied child development
i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter>
i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities
and
to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent
try and tell me that i'm a bad parent
it's really
uh
hard to believe so i feel very disrespected
um
unacknowledged angry frustrated
all those things <laughter>
um
i take i take benadryl to help me sleep
and i'm
so
<laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep
and last night i was crying
before i went to sleep
so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed
but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily
yeah i'm always thinking about my son
how i wish he was with me
and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle>
and like i don't deserve
to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom
you know
and i'm too hard on myself so
but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom
i just
i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me
and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because
i know he can do more for him
financially than i could
but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom
hmm
i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants
um
i take wellbutrin
i been on them for a couple weeks now
i think they're working i don't know
i'm not as
down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so
not that bad
um <sigh> hmm
my husband complains a lot he says
i'm not the same person
that i was when he married me
he said i was fun and i was positive and
i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle>
and
i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago
and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such
a shock
and um
i've just been trying to get back from it
but it's been hard
did i think i had a problem before i found out
found out what
oh
um
yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but
like um
my family would invite me
to family events
and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle>
or um
i don't know
it's just all the crying i think
and like i said my husband
letting me know that i'm not the same person
so
he's disappointed
and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too
another thing i'm feeling bad about
you know
yes i do i try
do i feel like the therapy's useful
um
yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week
so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter>
um
that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards
um
yeah
and she helps me make decisions you know
help me to be more proactive in my life
um
well
i'm looking for
jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that
you know and then she said something about
why don't you go back to school and
so i went and applied to go back to school
you know i'm not doing
much with my life and
sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either
so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college
in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills
so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas
that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing
with life life yeah
everything's always
bittersweet
um
i don't know
last time i was really happy
i don't know <laughter>
my ideal weekend
oh
i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent
reading maybe
but i can't really
i
i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um
but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading
something i've read
xxx
okay
i like to go to u_s_c
they have these nights where
they have things like book signings or poetry and art it's called visions and voices
so i like to go out to <t> to their events
and i usually enjoy those
um
about two weeks ago
um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for
a discovery of witches
and so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings
and see what it's like to be an author who's
talking to a crowd and signing books <laughter>
my son
i don't have any friends
my best qualities
um
i'm smart
i'm good-looking
um
i'm really um
and like a hard worker
i i'm dedicated to like self-improvement
um
that's all i can think of right now <laughter>
okay
