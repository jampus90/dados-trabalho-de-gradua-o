value
yes
i'm doing really good
i'm from granada hills california it's um the san fernando valley part of los angeles
i love the weather i like the diversity in people i like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's just not just one race or
kind of food i love the beaches
all the activities you could go do theme parks
aquariums stuff like that museums
the smog
um
there's a lot of creepy guys <laughter>
i've pretty much traveled around l_a i've been cross country and back three times twice was when i was seventeen
i like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live
um when i was seventeen i ran away with my boyfriend to upstate new york to watertown it was uh
like a navy army kind of town
we had an apartment there it snowed a lot
we sold antiques for a living
um getting passes press passes for the sunset strip music festival through a friend
and getting to meet rockstars and hang out at like the private parties
i'm very outgoing i love people
um i go to the gym and work out quite a bit i find it helps relieve stress and
keeps my energy level going i realized <rea> noticed if i don't work out a couple days i feel a little more tired than normal and
it just helps me feel good
i'm pretty good at it i'm very calm um i worked a lot of events and
jobs where you're dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm and
you know they're the customers so you have to make them feel wanted and
good and realize that you're getting paid 'cause the money they're spending so
i'm good at resolving <reso> resolving like consumer conflicts and stuff on the job
i had a drunk friend that was just
falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and i kinda
started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrasing and what she was saying to people was very mean you know
and i wonder like if you're talking to people like that
they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is l_a
i really don't feel guilty about anything decisions i've made in my life i've
think i've made really good decisions and i always stick with my moral compass what i'm doing i grew up in church so
i haven't gone in years but i still have those values and
you know the rules the ten commandments and stuff in my head
i had a slum lord landlord and um
i wish that i called you know the proper authorities and
followed through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code
i
a few years back i was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back  to where he was from
and after a few months you know he was coming to l_a and going back home i
decided to move there and i had just started
you know this business i was doing event planning was picking up and i decided to leave there
and try to do it there and  you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but
it was tough deciding like should i leave l_a and make this
jump and trace something new and experience something new or stay in what i was doing
i was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i was studying communications
like radio and television broadcasting and journalism
um somewhat i'm doing event work and i wrote for a magazine a couple years and i'm trying to like
get a website going and then have like where i'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of
you know writing <wri> writing for someone else
i always wanted to write and was always into the news and music and art growing up i really like connie chung
she was like a channel four newscaster in the eighties and i love barbara walters
i was a nerd no <laughter>
um my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family
and i have a good relationship with my mom um i never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me
i have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so i don't really talk to them on the phone we just communicate on facebook  or like twitter
oh i go right to sleep
when i get tired i just go to sleep
pretty good energetic i've been motivated to go look for more event work you know event planning stuff and
really grinding in more than i was
i mean it's kinda hard 'cause you gotta talk to people and get them to trust you and
see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else
no
no
i mean i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone i know dies
i wouldn't say that i'm just
super like oh my god happy all the time but it's like an even
keel that i feel pretty good all the time
i'm very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and
i could adapt to different situations and even if i it's not my scene
or situation or group of people that i'm used to i could still jump in
talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt
i wanna make more money <laughter>
i remember in like second grade this people used to make fun of me 'cause i was very tall and skinny and i had like
straight a's one of the highest grades in the class so
people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or
stuff like that
very talkative she would just say that i talk to everyone
and that i'm very friendly and if you need help
that i'll help someone you know
oh recently i went up to oceanside and visited a friend i've known years and
we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and
we got her two year old son and like took him to the park and played and
it was really nice and it was cool visiting her i hadn't seen her in six months and
it was really fun and i wanna go again and
i like the area
mhm
i
guess maybe i could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people
i think i pursue it but i think maybe i could put a little more time a day into it
i don't really know anything like
that i would wanna erase or not happen
no i feel good about my choices i've made and i think i'm on the right path and
a lot of things i wanted to do then balls rolling and i'm getting <g> you know getting things done i'm not as big as i wanna be but i feel like i'm on my way there
um like ten years ago i would've told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as i was
um my friend we call mojo
um mojo has a magazine and i just wrote years and
he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball i'm rolling and
he's one of the biggest people you know in my life telling me you're talented
you could do it you know he's just a really
good like motivation for me
you know being published i've been on t_v shows and just getting my own event thing going and
i have a lot of people who read what i write every day and follow on i just think it's a you know it's not exactly kinda where i wanna be but it's a great start
and i worked to get to that point
great thanks
