i argued with my brother last night actually about him
talking to me with with more respect
as a person
i was mad and i wanted to fight
it's good but sometimes they're just
they're too caught up in what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings
like with my brother he's just
he's just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush <br> brush it off on me
wasting money 'cause i'm married now

something like probably taking some candy from the store no no
taking money from my mom when i was like real young
'cause she
