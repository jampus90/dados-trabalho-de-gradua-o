value
yes
i'm doing okay it's still morning so
i'm from the east coast massachusetts
yes
um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter>
um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas
um
l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry
and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a
in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street
so the
yeah
um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school
but uh
after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses
um
well i love the beach
and i love the mountains i like to go hiking
um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy
no
not at all
um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger
went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately
um overseas
um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit
but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out
oh that's alright
gah
um
i don't have one
to be honest um
i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter>
so
um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment
um as to if we wanna
continue communicating with the person or not
and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot
so
yes
um
i like watching movies
i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book
um not good at times i uh i have a
some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get
uh yesterday
and it was with my partner
and um
actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just
sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself
so
um
at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind
um i do not
purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature
but
i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged
so
um
uh last year my mother died
so
i wish i handled that differently
um
it upsets <ups> it's upsets me
so
it's okay
um let me see
uh <sigh>
i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter>
that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired
but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because
it's like i can't uh
i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep
um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind
uh you know thinking about bills and
and
the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it
uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode
it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating
everything so
i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter>
i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee
yeah
so other than that
i'm
i'm okay
um well i've been i've been depressed
for quite some time
and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty
uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died
so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to
get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do
that i haven't done in a year because of what happened
um i just
i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat
um
i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep
so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day
yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis
oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably
ten to fifteen years ago
and it's just something i've never
gotten over i don't know whether or not
you can so i've always taken the medicine
um
i was
arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i
was feeling desperate and hopeless
and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago
which caused me to be hospitalized
and then uh
they started treating me i started seeing a therapist
so
um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist
but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some
avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me
i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there
and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this
and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback
as to how to deal with the emotions
tools to help you deal with your emotions
so
um
like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication
um
there's been no changes really
i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver
and uh
even though a lot of times i
feeled i felt overwhelmed or
lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her
uh
i still was a heck of a lot happier
than i am now
so
um
uh <sigh>
i would say when my son was born years ago
i'm not a parent anymore he passed away
so
um
and that was difficult as well
uh
hmm
um i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me
because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained
and um
you know those qualities are are admirable in people that can keep their word and and be responsible
excuse me
oh i have lots of regrets um
uh things that i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about
but um you know i met somebody once in my life
that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker
uh
live to never regret
so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation
but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done
um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really
give my friends any kind of advice i mean
i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother
um
i just state my opinion that's all
um well right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating
after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive
i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot
you know sleep eat sleep eat
and so now i'm kinda like on a diet trying to lose this weight 'cause it's very unhealthy for me
um
hmm
trying to think it's been a long time
actually there's really nothing because
now i just keep my mind busy
i haven't been to a movie in ages i don't i used to go out shopping all the time i don't now
um
so it's been it uh it's been quite some time since
i've been content and happy with who i am and what i'm doing in my life right now
um my weekends saturday <sa> uh like on saturday i'm usually working
um on sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house
um
run some errands go shopping for food
you know that kinda thing
so
it's not if i was younger you know it would be fun you know go out clubbing or whatever but i'm too old for that now
xxx
um
hmm really there's nothing that i can think of um
there's nothing that i can be proud of
hmm
um
some a good like comedy or whatever i like to watch that um
sometimes my partner might do something stupid which i like
because i like make fun of him
um
but mm just that's it you know go <g> maybe go out for a walk on the beach that's it
okay
no problem thank you
bye
