value
yes
doing good
new york city
well uh
originally i was born here but uh
spent some time back east and um moved back here and um
basically sort of raised here so
been here a while and i'm enjoying it
there's great weather and um
uh amusement parks a lot of scenery a lot of people
uh a lot of energy and excitement
there's so many things to really like about l_a
see uh a lot of congestion and pollution
i i try to but no i don't
uh
it's nice to be on the open road with uh
mm potentially <potelingly>  time to think about my own life
shy
sometimes i find it hard to express my own thoughts
well you mentioned a fish tank and uh
i view spent some time in a
many waiting rooms where there's been fishtanks and uh
uh so staring at fishtanks could be one of them
uh but i also enjoy walking or
uh lifting weights reading going to movies just to say a few things
uh good
moderate uh good um
in control
argued about today okay last argument was today
just before i got here
and it was
about um
having about how do i say this about taking them to a bus stop about uh
how uh making an arrangement
feel guilty about
not taking better care of my pet
sure i i like birds so one of my pets was a bird
uh as of recently
and
i
let my bird out into the wild
and
sort of wish i had planned for better
um
future for the for the bird
uh only because now i sort of wish the bird
was uh closer to me
hm
i would say
i get into arguments with people close to me friends
and
sometimes i i don't handle them well
i am more
reactive
so i wish uh i'd like to see myself improve on that
uh no
um at least not you know in any sort of legal trouble but uh
i think it's you know it's kind of
not the way that i would like to have handled it
guess the hardest decision was about to
of
how to
proceed with
moving forward eh on
a
job opportunity
i had to
decide whether
if i would
suffer more emotional pain by leaving
my family and whether the financial gain and
uh knowledge
of that experience would over outweigh the benefit
uh yes yes i am
well i it's a small family but um
have a mother and a
uh sister and a brother
and uh two younger nieces
older they're they're grown adults
uh it's a it's a good relationship
and
uh
things could be better
um sometimes it's sort of difficult pain
staking
uh relationship at times
there's uh some days i'm
i need time for myself and i
would rather give the time to
other people rather than to take time for myself which has been my experience
uh and so
that has caused me a lot me a lot of emotional
pain uh a little bit of spiritual
uh anxiety about my future if i continue to do that sort of thing
wow there's so many things <laughter> what about you i don't know anything about you
i would say uh well there's there's a few um
but of recent i um
well
things are going pretty good i'm
can't really say there's anything as of yet that i would really want to change or or have anything to regret on that i can remember
it's been pretty good
and uh
it's uh i'd say it's okay uh
i'm handling my sleep pretty well
when i don't sleep well sometimes i can be irritable um
sometimes it's okay uh
and uh would say if
there's also times where i'm
unhappy
so
i try to
get as much sleep as i need
yes
i
believe i was uh nineteen
and uh
i'm glad i did it
yes uh
sort of but uh yes
no
um well uh
i guess i suppose it made me a more confident person and more
um
in tune with uh
uh the country that i'm living in and people
uh
to be more noticeable more watchful of where i live
um hanging out with some friends uh
on a really nice weekend and uh on a boat
uh or on a skiff a really small boat and um
trying to fish in
i felt uh free or alive um happy
um uninhibited
uh strong confident uh mature
after the military
uh after military
took some time to evaluate my
my thoughts and uh
my future and um
just sort of took uh the necessary steps uh to move ahead
uh it's sort of hard it is
um
uh it wasn't easy uh
a lot of family uh help and um and community
and uh
so it took some adjusting but it wasn't easy
uh no
no
uh you know
this week um
partially today
happy's
uh happy sort of often not too happy but
content
happy
happy
i don't know uh not usually too happy
try to stay
on the center line
do a weekend
um up early
um get out enjoy the day um
hook up with some friends
and uh
doing a little bit of socializing
and uh
maybe get some form of uh
view some form of artistic expression
there's a maybe a like a museum or uh stare at some art or
uh maybe something in the local community
maybe street art
and uh
or perhaps something with music or
uh
something something of that nature
i wish perhaps uh some things that i could change about myself um
make
more decisive about decisions
and uh something else um
that i
had the same ability for a knack for
uh for meeting more people i suppose
as best friends describe me i don't know um
nice friendly
uh
trustworthy sociable
uh
the same advice i'd give myself <laughter> today
something wow
uh
i really enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and her two children
and that was yesterday
and i'm glad i did that it was a good time for everybody
uh i'm proud i went into the military and um
i'm glad i did that it was a good experience
bye thank you
