value
i am
i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee
and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today
i was born and raised in los angeles
and i'm one of the few locals from around here
and uh i went to school away and uh
but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles
yes i am
i like the weather
having owned a vacation house in another state
that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here
um i like the culture i like the diversity
i like the familiarity
i like that beaches
uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert
but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that
and uh i think it's a great place to live
thank you
well
more of some maybe some of the
things i don't like about l_a or say california in general
say like the high tax rate
which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now
which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations
i'm a small business owner
so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated
and uh that's a big problem here in uh
uh california
it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh
also uh
you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't
see that but it's a big tax on the social service system
and that's what makes our taxes
uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
so that's
you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries
and uh
i don't travel as much as i used to
but i've traveled quite a bit
and i've learned a couple of languages and uh
i served
i'm sorry
uh
i didn't really understand uh your question
when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and
i've been all through europe eastern europe
asia
south america
north africa
um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf
'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up
and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga
and work out and uh
i try to eat healthy and uh
that's a big part of my life
oh
sure
um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span
but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times
we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local
and rented a small flat and
cooked and did our own shopping but really
having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days
it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city
and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french
which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger
my mother insisted that all of us kids
take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh
all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french
with the french
you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
<laughter> so that was a
uh
i have a few different degrees
so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate
and uh
that was fun
and i also have a masters
uh degree in economics
and i have a degree in crisis management
so
uh i found them um
interesting
and uh
it was something that i wanted to do
where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports
and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland
and i originally wanted to be a doctor but
once you start going to school
for a little bit you change your mind
etcetera so
um i'm actually in the wholesale business now
for wholesale distributors of furniture products
and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago
well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business
and it's
pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it
but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
hm
actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home
and uh
uh
i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter
and uh
you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked
but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids
you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life
so
probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers
but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable
i think i'm more of an extrovert
whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted
but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation
and be more um
introverted
i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh
one of my i have uh several computers at home
and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well
i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach
you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes
it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years
i had
it uh
i usually find exercise helps me relax the best
or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter>
but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
yes that was uh
that was it but
that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills
i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years
i think i've gotten better
uh at the
i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature
as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and
be a little more
how do you had had the skills earlier
i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged
um
you know i
i am more likely to think before i speak now
whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought
so i might've said more things that i
in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or
a work situation
um
but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it
i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
oh wow
you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional
argument um
probably
um
my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter
and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just
basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting
and uh just
uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused
us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument
but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree
butt heads
so
i felt like i was talking to a wall
and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've
learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should
usually have but you're not really thinking of that because
sometimes when we're younger we're
looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me
but you know
i'm pretty easy going and i have
different
ideas on raising children how she did
and that was more
not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really
discussed those things but it was really just fundamental
reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match
whereas other things looked good
you know on paper to both of us
hm
there's one recently my father passed away uh recently
thank you
and
really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days
and i really only invited very very close friends and family members
i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of
not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a
i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact
that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known
about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but
now as time's passed i wish i'd invited
more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends
you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just
and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because
i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but
i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little
they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that
you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less
doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really
mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so
um well both my parents are recently
uh deceased in the last couple of years
and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away
in december
and
we're not super close like i always like i look at other families
we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting
i guess we're also uh different
and uh
i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family
not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that
we just
never did that because we're all
all so uh
uh different
yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but
you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know
but i think every family has their own sort of
stuff
um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from
some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from
you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was
but i think i function
pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years
i didn't enlist i was an officer
i went to one of the service academies
that
um seventeen i started when after high school
and i went to a service academy
so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into
i was but same age as everybody else that went there
uh we did
nineteen eighty three
um
just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just
we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled
at the time
and poison gas was sprayed on us
so
that was a
it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh
too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation
that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you
you actually play in the game and the same with uh
you know if you're in a combat
unit
well it made me more patriotic having grown up
in california
whereas people who are from all over the country
and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did
never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i
ended up becoming uh
just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country
whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or
georgia north dakota south dakota montana
grows up with that kind of uh
pride so i thought it was good and it
unlike so many of my friends that
they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan
uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school
and i got two graduate degrees
and i went to work in private enterprise
uh
didn't care for it
then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic
for a number of years and
then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell
um
at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked
and again i was an officer
uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile
to be able to come back to los angeles
uh
because it was just so uh
so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality
so but
it was a great experience
um
it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late
and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well
even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um
but i generally sleep uh
i generally sleep pretty well
i feel pretty good lately
you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but
boy the last few months i feel great pretty much
no not really
i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately
um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it
and
you know
it wasn't
anything real too debilitating
and i wasn't able to really function
on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling
i do i was really against it in the past
and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh
my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past
i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous
and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it
oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about
life relationships
and sometimes it's good talking things out with a
a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger
so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and
i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that
uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off
i do have someone that i go to
yeah
i think it's nice
you know they really
if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped
they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's
always in the past they just help you talk through your
your thoughts
and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity
to the situation that's why i like
talking to someone who has a lot more life experience
and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man
so but it's
um
i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and
was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you
but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good
uh this morning
i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and
family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather
and i have a bunch of errands to run
and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out
and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold
where i always i know that term so
but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day
and i looked forward to feeling the sun
so
uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects
i'm too smart for my own good
and i'm a
i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational
i'm very resourceful
people always call me when they have issues
and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go
whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or
you know i'm great with medical diagnoses
uh
and uh
you know people also say i'm a lot of fun
i'm fun to be with
and um
i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white
i am what i am
i don't b_s
you know
i'm the opposite of a politician
so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them
so that's pretty much
no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully
i like to think i do
uh
probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy
uh
i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger
uh
but just a lot of it's very typical
really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive
or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now
i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking
in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices
um i'm proud of my daughter she's
a nice young lady i am uh
proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my
military service and fire service
um there are very few people like me who did it
who are as
had the background in education that i did but i like public service
and um
so i'm proud of uh that
proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees
sort of like trophies
i'm proud that i've been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and
knock wood maintain good health
it was nice meeting you
bye bye thank you
