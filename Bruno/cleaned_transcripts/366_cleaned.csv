value
yeah
i'm great
and you
uh los angeles california
uh <sigh> i like the diversity
i feel l_a by itself is a country there's so much to do so much to explore
and uh there's nothing like it
traffic <laughter> uh i would say traffic and the real estate prices are kinda crazy compared to the rest of the country
but other than that then you know it's fine
i have traveled um i have traveled a bit
um i would like to travel more though so but i've traveled to i've been to a few countries
um i've been to
i won't say europe that's a continent um i've been to uh london <deep breath> um i was born here but my family's from nigeria so i've been to nigeria
a few times i've been to denmark
um amsterdam
i've been to uh where else have i gone uh germany
um
and i think that's i think that's it yeah think that's it
yeah
just exploring uh exploring <exp> exploring new places um seeing new things meeting new people a different culture
it's definitely um
um
gives you an appreciation for life
and the diversity of it and also um going to countries that may not be
as developed as the u_s it definitely it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know this country
yeah
okay well <sigh> uh let's see london i accident actually when i first heard about going to london i really didn't care for it 'cause i didn't know much about it the only i thing i remember <mem> i remember
is watching mary poppins <laughter> and um
but um when i went there i absolutely fell in love with it um just <deep breath>
it still <sti> it has the hustle and bustle of l_a
but at the same time you can go at a very very slow pace um we didn't do any driving we just
went on the tube
um which is their like the underground subway station which i absolutely fell in love with
and um
just exploring um different parts of the city we went to you know big ben westminster abbey
uh they actually had when i went there they had the premiere of um what movie was this um
slumdog millionaire
and also they had the premiere for um
seven seven pounds it was a movie with will smith
um they did so will smith was over there and we were you know
me and my friends were like kinda like screaming like we were like groupies <laughter> just you know just <laughter> just <laughter> just to you know for antics but um yeah it was it was a lot of fun it was a lot of fun
yeah
uh business management and an option in human resources management what that means i have no idea <laughter>
um
good question
i've always
i've always wanted to go into business um
and i've always wanted to study finance but
i didn't think i would learn too much about finance from
college per se i think i've learned more in the real world whatnot
so the other option was human resource and i'm always fascinated about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so i went for that
no <laughter> well i still i still kinda use what i've learned but i i work in property management
so um
it still has to do with people anything to do with people i'm fascinated about
so
yeah
that was a good one um
my dream job wow
i would say being a life coach
i would uh yeah i would say that would my dream job because i love helping people become successes and i help
i love being a part of someone else's success even no regardless of how small it is
um whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation
i like um i just help <hel> like helping people have a better life so i think uh
you know but i do it for free i'd do it for free like all day
yeah
yeah
more outgoing
definitely more outgoing i'm usually um
the life well it's it's weird 'cause i'm usually considered like the life of the party i'm the one who's cracking jokes and making everybody laugh at the same time i can be very very
quiet and to myself
so
yeah
right
<sigh> to relax i usually listen to music
i usually listen to music to relax me or i
pray
to to relax myself or listen to some really calm music
so
yeah
very good
very very good i used to uh
i wouldn't say it was a bad temper but i was known to um
go off quote on quote <laughter> not in a not in a you know not throwing chairs or anything like that but
i'm a very very patient person
but once that patience <patien> is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it's done i
i just go off
no mm mm
no
<sigh> the last time i argued with someone <some> wow i haven't argued with somebody in a long time
um <sigh>
boy
mm
uh i argued with my
no
i would say my i think it my dad i argued with him
um
about <sigh> xxx what was it about
um
we were disagreeing on some things about when we were gonna supposed to go back to nigeria
and
he wasn't listening to
it was a kind of like a group discussion myself and my my siblings
and he was being very subjective he wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns
so um it started an argument
uh very
uh
i wouldn't say angry per se but i felt very
kinda like i was losing control
like um i'm the type where i i like to be in control of my emotions and of my thoughts and i feel
once that patience is gone and i start going off it's kinda like this
this uh
you know
i won't call it a blur but
i'm very witty and quick with what i say so
i will instantly say something that you know
up not necessarily hurtful but um very direct and to the point and i make sure i get my point across
yeah
um i have three brothers one one younger two older i'm very close with my family and my mom is one of my best friends
um <sigh>
my brothers are great um
love 'em to death
uh my father eh he's moreso out of the picture
yeah
i don't i don't really i'm not the guilty type <laughter> i don't feel
guilty i'm not one to shy away from what i've done and i definitely own up to what i do i'm not one to shy away from responsibility but i don't think i ever feel
guilty
for anything i do
yeah i don't think i feel i i usually don't feel guilty
yeah
pretty pretty easy
um pretty easy at <a> at
yeah i'm pretty good at falling asleep except when i'm excited and when i'm reading <laughter> when i'm trying to when i'm when i'm focused on learning something like i'll read and read and read
even when it's past my bed time
but now i'm trying to work on
waking up much earlier
then when i am now and that's kind of a struggle <st> a little bit of a struggle but i'm getting to it so
good
um
i've been feeling i've been feeling fine you know i'm generally i have a very very happy disposition
and so
no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever if i feel do feel like i'm going
i don't allow myself to go to that place
nah
no
sorry
thoughts
i would say
well <we> it's i wouldn't say necessarily changes but i'd say moreso behaviors learning how to
let go of past decisions
maybe and kinda how they they played their course in my life
um
i just sometimes i kinda look back and say what if i did this what would've
how would life be now
no
so the those are some games i play but other than that
that's it
hmm <laughter>
regret
uh
no
no mm mm there isn't anything i regret
<sigh> ten to twenty years ago
i would say don't be afraid of who you are
um be authentic
um
more importantly with yourself
hmm erase from my memory
uh
boy that's a good one
hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm
uh
wow
erase from my memory
uh
i would say when i told <t> when i told my dad that he should act like a father
maybe i shouldn't
yeah there was um
that was actually one of the times i <laughter> another time i went off usually with him um
uh
basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college
um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother
and um <sigh> my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like
uh four a_p classes
i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field
so
needless to say i was <laughter> i i i i was kinda like burning myself
i was kinda like burning myself out
and um
i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too
and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time
so um
and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone
um so uh
um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out
at that point in time so i'm just gonna you know
you know just just
take the
d or fail whatever
and he didn't he didn't like that 'cause he is a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's what maybe where it came from he's a teacher as well um
and so
he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him
you know since you're my father you should act like it
but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so
that was um
one thing
oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing
um and that is i wish i continued
um with college throughout
like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at
i wanna say nineteen
'cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year
in high school
but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would've
continued maybe that's one small thing but
that's something small though
yeah
hmm
i'm very
um i'm a very compassionate and understanding person
um
i like learning new things um i'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice i'm very objective
i'll tell you the good the bad the ugly
and um
yeah those are some of my best qualities yeah
and i'm fun i like to have fun i'll have fun in any situation i can make light of any situation like i'm the kinda type <ty> type of person i can break the tension in the room that's sort of
that sort of uh <tisk> um
personality trait
yeah
wish i was taller <laughter> um
uh besides my height
hmm
i wish
ah
maybe
i don't know if it's uh
be more
i won't say be more in touch with my emotions but i think
i would say
understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes
i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person
where
people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i don't realize how much
they do i think that's a realizing how much they care and love me
that's one thing i would like to
get more
of a
grasp on
<laughter> my best friend <deep breath> uh she describes me as someone who's funny
crazy
um
objective
um loyal
um ambitious hardworking um
mean <laughter> when i just make jokes she says you're so mean but um
just <sigh> i just i <laughter> i i just like to i joke around all the time and so um
we were right now we're actually planning um uh
a friend of mine or a friend of ours um a baby shower
i'm giving her some ideas and there's another friend who was invited who
we had some issues in the past and someone i don't talk to or hang out with we used to be really close but i don't really talk to that person but i don't mind them being there
so she also talked about having <havi> celebrating her birthday
also at kinda like after the baby shower
and there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we really <rea> didn't do anything for and i'm like well if we're celebrating this person's birthday might as well we should definitely
you know honor this person's birthday as well since we're closer to you know the person xxx birthday's passed
and i said you know what just why <wh> don't we celebrate everybody's birthday
<laughter> forget the baby shower just do the birthdays
and then <laughter> that's when that's when she said you're so mean <laughter> but she was laughing about it so
yeah
yeah
uh <sigh> most proud of in my in my life <deep breath>
uh <sigh>
i would say being there for my family
being being a a mentally and emotionally strong person
family's gone through a lot of challenges and a lotta times i've been the one to make sure
everything goes okay and everything make sure <su> everything <everythi> make sure everything goes accordingly
um so i'd say more than anything making sure i was there for my family
yeah
oh
okay thank you
bye have a good one
