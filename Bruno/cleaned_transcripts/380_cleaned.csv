value
sure
i'm fine i'm doing alright um
yeah
i'm from maryland
yeah
from maryland washington d_c area
uh like five weeks ago
maryland um <deep breath> it's a lot it's a lot less um
uh xxx it's a uh it's not as nice this time of year it's more um
uh it's it's good it's nice it's um
l_a's a lot better though it's a lot it's a lot more people lot more going on
um i'm still <st> i guess i'm still getting used to it so
um
it's
it's not like um
yeah i'm still getiing used to it it's it's coming slowly but but surely
i live in culver city
i do i have one
uh it's okay it's i live in a really nasty house it's uh it's cheap <chea> it's cheap 'cause i'm living in a friend's place
um
and uh
but but and he's letting me stay there for half price but the the actual like place itself is pretty horrible <horr> horrible living conditions <laughter> but i'm moving soon so
i can't see your shoes actually
uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything
i enjoy the chance to get to like see other
um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the
the specificity of my own
you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um
i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing
mhm
uh okay um
hmm
putting me on the spot here ellie
um
let's see
uh
well um i
it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess
one of the last trips i did was to um
i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw
but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole
like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally
it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um
unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so
so um
uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal
hmm
it's a tough question um
one <on> um
i uh
hmm
you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that
yeah
come back to it
yeah
that's what i just said
film
you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know
i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys
and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls
um
and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and
at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um
like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in
playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film
like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always
i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like
um
and uh and i never
uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was
fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars
the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck
and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so
i'm not really sure uh
yeah it's it's it's
um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film
but
uh i've always been fascinated by like
how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general
i am yes
um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct
and uh put <pu> put together
and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make
movies
uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the
all the processes but
i guess the best parabole for that would be a director
directing
well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them
um
my
i guess um
it's funny you should ask ellie um
i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't
when away
like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like
i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like
of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like
um thinks positively about me
um so it's i have like a
a complicated relationship with my parents
i mean <mea> and my family in general
well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like
um
i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um
i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like
uh
or inhibited person maybe um
so i like to like
until
yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it
um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed
so now i you know i have a glass of wine and
maybe watch a movie
um
i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um
if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like
then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might
go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like
you know competitive sports and hiking
pretty good
well i always like arguing um
i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper
um
i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um
but i don't
as long as my like
'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks
uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject
um
and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think
um
one of my weaker points i would say
but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question
um
what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate
hmm
the last time i had a heated debate
was um i had a heated debate about
uh the movie boogie nights
um
i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about
'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the
like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie
um
they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um
they have a certain uh they think that the
like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like
complexity of character within the movie
and um
that somehow like
<sigh> um
what what were they saying they were saying like the movie
it like xxx it's like the end of an era
which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they
how they interact in the plot
um
kind of like
uh
yeah i guess
i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's
the um
i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i
i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it
um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool
um
the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but
but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie
and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like
so in the movie django unchained
um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big
the
big purpose of the movie is
and um
and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh
who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he
was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django
or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera
and um
and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not
sacrifice themself for someone else
um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like
um
like who
uh like
she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that
altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist
um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself
um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like
every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um
purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate
um
and uh
somewhat like yeah and it's it uh
so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um
i think of losing my temper as being more
um
like i just
so <s> i i would so <s>
revert to um ad hominem like attacks
uh but i i didn't like that's not um
maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like
well you're an idiot
you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort
yeah i'm glad you understand
an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments
not
stories um
like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so
yeah
the hardest decision i've ever had to make
oh geez
could it just be one of the hardest decisions
hmm
um
like choosing between two things that it's like
i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between
two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life
but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um
and uh but i had to do it
for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends
were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world
and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't
i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think
it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back
to new york within like a month or two
uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could
leave new york
it was how hard was that
or how hard is
how hard was that
um
it was hard
<laughter> um
it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like
isolating isolating <is>
'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends
and uh
that had kind of gone extremely
badly
and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole
everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of
saw it at the time so i didn't like
you know just being socially isolated etcetera
yeah
well recently it's been awful
um
i uh
i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours
um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams
but previous to that night
so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep
um because i was working on set and i would get back
and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um
too much riled up energy or something i i don't know
tired uh
very
not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning
and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so
um
i guess
with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go
um without caffeine it's
i'm just i'm just quieter i guess
more introverted
since
like lately as in when
um
change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like
eh at the beginning where the
the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends
and the the push to
to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um
overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like
coming to terms with that um
and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just
you know
you you know <sigh> you know <sigh>
no i just
nope
the last time i felt really happy
might have to reach back
um
i think the last time i felt really happy
was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie
um co-wrote co-directed co-produced
um
and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the
writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up
eat breakfast
bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative
full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and
and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like
just like
i felt like it yeah i guess that was the
the last time that was that was like
eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like
you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't
it's too much else to do so
i would say that i'm very
accepting <acce> like
accepting of other people
and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um
and
open <o> open <ope> like
excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and
yeah um
hmm
um
i guess i wish i was less uh
uh
less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my
you know
everyday interactions and in my like
um
you know
zest for for living
um <sigh> yeah i xxx
i other things i would change about myself i'd
i would
i don't know <laughter>
hmm
really badly about myself
um
i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like
uh
like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um
some sort of uh
conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always
always on the other side of the court you know like never
it was i i noticed
or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were
like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with
like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which
um i was like blamed or like you know
it was my it was my fault um when
when what i was doing like
yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like
there's no yeah i don't know
yeah
ten years ago um
stay stake you know like i i think that there's um
i have a tendency to
like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes
um
ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't
don't decide that you um
are only going to do
one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums
would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes
um
as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't
it's only now that i um i don't know i guess
stay uh
don't stay <sta> stay stay focused <fo> yeah i don't know that's a tough tough question <que> tough question ellie
that's it
sure
goodbye
bye
