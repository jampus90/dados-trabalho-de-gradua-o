value
hi
yes
today is a wonderful day i am doing just absolutely marvelous
i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to los angeles when i was sixteen years old
yes
mm uh i've only been back once since i left
it's a whole another
community
when i was growing up i'm so glad i grew up there because it was a great sense of community which i think we don't have here in los angeles <sniffle>
uh my my grandmother died and left property for my father
so we came here to manage her property property
uh it was pretty easy for me i was still young
and it was easy to adapt so i'm pretty good at meeting people so uh that has never been a problem i traveled a lot as a child
so i was used to moving and going to new places
meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life
oh one of my best trips i had it was in
nineteen i'm dating myself but nineteen sixty four <sniffle> i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland
ohio and i went to an indian reservation
and i got a little note card about the reservation when i got back home i wrote to the reservation and i told them i when i came <ca> went back to school in september i would have to write
uh deliver a speech rather about what i did over the summer and i told them i wanted to
talk about going to the indian reservation and would they send me something and they sent me this
huge
kachina indian doll
and that was <wa> that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if i still had it i found out like a quarter of a million dollars so
mm
but that's one of the best xxx
um i could be a little bit of both
um i'm pretty when i have to be i can be outgoing 'cause i'm good at meeting <mee> talking to people and meeting people but sometimes i have a little bashful side a little shy side of me too so
so a little bit of both
i studied business administration <ad> administration with a uh emphasis in marketing and advertising
um well i really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't this what it is today
and um i liked <li> i was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and i love people
so i wanted something that would bring me
interaction with people so i went into marketing
and i was working for a t_v station where i was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so
no now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer i shoot a lot of stars
i shoot on the red carpet
i shoot a lot of special events and anything else people will pay me for <laughter>
it's not hard at all it's my passion i love it it's like not working
i'm in my dream job
i i just need to get more
jobs <j> jobs to that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as a photographer you have to do a lot of things <thin> events for free to get known
so it's a building process of relationships so i'm still in that process of building relationships
so that i can get more paid jobs but this is my dream job i love what i do
well now i'm really back into it i used to do it a while then i got away from it but it's meditation
i practice meditation and i try to do it twice a day in the morning
and at night before i go to sleep i work with oprah and deepak chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and i use that to
calm my body
um i can generally control my temper sometimes i get set off i guess like any other human person <per> being but i work at trying to keep a moderate and temperate
uh temper in personality
oh wow we i argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her
but it obviously did
and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her mm and maybe what i said did
and that's what started the argument
oh god i felt terrible because i i never intended to hurt my daughter
and i never would wanna hurt her
and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said so i had to have to guard my words and watch my thoughts
well i don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me
and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughter's a makeup artist and i'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so
sometimes i think we're up on each other too close
we need a little more space
yeah when i say the wrong things <laughter> it's
no it's never easy to be a parent it's a work in progress
making the right decisions about things sometimes
the love the feel the feeling of accomplishment
that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet
to be a a
uh wonderful and productive human being
i'm not as strict as my parents were i give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are
um i'm not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual
um so i brought them up different from me on the religious tip
and um
i'm more i listen more to them i think than what my parents did it was
you were to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids' voice be heard
one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know wanna go into details i feel bad about that night <laughter>
yeah i could've stayed home <laughter>
wow i'm trying to think about a situation
maybe the handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i could've handled that a little differently
well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to a
a end and the way we separated was kind of explosive
and i think both of us could've handled it better but i think i played a part in in keeping a lot of drama going
'cause i was hurt that we were breaking up and kinda devastated 'cause i wanted my child to be raised with her father
so i think it looking back now which is you know hindsight is twenty twenty vision
i could've handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you'd do better
the hardest decision i've ever had to make
the hardest decision i've ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke
was going to make an a connection
and
to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me
and he told me
that i could not get on that plane
because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself
i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on
to montgomery alabama where we were headed
and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go
but my life was in the balance
so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one <sniffle>
ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week
and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work
and i'm on a plane and i feel this
weird feeling coming over the left side of my body
and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong
it was it was when you to your life
and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's gonna happen next so it was very disturbing
very traumatic
and i you know you don't know what's happening to you it's so the weirdest thing riding to
the hospital in a
medical ambulance
that was a weird experience
yeah but i'm here
i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so
the universe wasn't finished with me yet
you know what that's sometimes i have a little problem with it um
sleeping a little bit sometimes i
i get wired up <laughter> i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head
um i'm sluggish
um probably a little on edge
but i try and keep a a upbeat personality i'm a real energetic person
so i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you
so
lately i've been feeling really well um except
i've been having some
problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't but i'm so grateful to be alive
that that is really minor <mi> minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't
fortunately <for> fortunately
my i didn't lose my facial structure or
you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use
but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work
um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat
energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful
no but i went through depression
uh from being knocked unconscious five times when i was a school teacher
every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from
having like sleep apnea and not being able to sleep
from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head
so
no only i don't go to therapy because
um i don't i don't have any medical right now so i'm not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical
it's hard to get it <sniffle> and then i don't i'm not working <work> yeah it sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability
so that i can
get well
'cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing
so that's kind of depressing
to think after all the years i've been working since i was sixteen and it's taking me it's been over a year it was a year
i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i won't have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i
get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year
and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job
and my life is kinda up in the air right now
'cause i'm wondering what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance <sniffle>
i feel happy every day every day i wake up
and i can breathe and i can see
and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph i'm happy it's just a good thing
to be in the present moment and to be alive <sniffle>
mm you know what i figured like what good are regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now
so just live <li> move forward
mm what advice would i give myself <sniffle> don't let anything get in your way
you know keep a good personality and a energetic spirit and just keep pushing
energetic talkative
uh won't take no for an answer uh follow through reliable
um good spirited
giving loving
um i'm most proud of that
i have been able to find out my creative side i've been a visual artist i never took a art lesson before
i taught art <sniffle> um i was
in my late twenties before i even discovered that i could draw and paint
um i'm a doll collector
uh i'm i'm my creative side is what i'm most proud of because it's been able to help me
being creative i can no matter what even when i i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out
and just go take pictures and that was so
soothing to my soul
that i'm i'm i'm glad that i have a creative side and that i found it and have utilized it
mhm
uh huh
and that's is that it bye bye
bye
