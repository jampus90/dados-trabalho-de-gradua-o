value
yes
i'm doing well
uh california
i like the weather i like the people
i don't like the traffic uh that's primarily it
sociology
yep
uh it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects
no
to be a writer
um
i like being able to write what i want to write uh right now i write things that i'm not really that interested in
like uh articles about uh
teenager culture
stuff like that
um
i think they have it pretty easy they don't know how easy they have it <laughter>
uh no not really
mm depends on the situation or who i'm around when i first meet people i can be shy uh but if it's someone i've known for a while i can be outgoing
um i'll lay down or try some sort like deep breathing
or uh just maybe do something that's kinda fun and mind numbing like watch t_v
i'm pretty good i don't really let anger show that much um
i'm not like a i don't have a fiery temper or anything like that i'm pretty rational
um
i actually can't remember when the last time i argued with someone was 'cause it's been so long
um
i guess i feel guilty about the fact that i don't talk to my grandparents as much as i should
um i'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family
uh 'cause they basically sort of raised me uh and uh my parents
weren't
really in the picture that much
um <sigh>
i can't really think of one
right now
uh
i guess uh when my sister died it was really traumatizing
mhm
yeah
yes
um
i guess the hardest decision i've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband
uh because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but i still felt like i should stick it out
i mean it was hard at the time uh but
i made the right decision i think
uh my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age
um she's just a very strong powerful
uh sort of staunch character
and that rubbed off on me
uh not really super easy um
i sort of i mean it's my probably my fault i go to bed too late
just sort of foggy and distracted
i have trouble concentrating
you mean like my body
uh
normal
fine
no complaints
no
it's been the same as ever
no
no
uh
last night i was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff
uh probably funny and uh easy to get along with but also caring
uh i spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies watching t_v
uh
no
i don't think
there's not i don't <do> i don't think uh i think regretting <r> regretting things is a waste of time
um
don't  try to
don't go out of your way to try and impress people
if
they like you then they like you
um
sometimes
sometimes i can be kinda lazy
uh
i'd like to have more of a um like sort of  uh
better work ethic i guess
uh just sort of putting off stuff um until you know right when it's due or after it's due things like that um  procrastinating
uh <sigh>
sometimes for the things that i write uh people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website
and that'll make me feel bad
i'm uh articulate
and funny and a good friend
um
i guess i'm most proud of the fact that uh
i
am satisfied with
myself
and my friends and my status in the world
i'm proud of the fact that i feel comfortable with it
um just hanging out with my friends uh
sort of people watching
watching a movie that's good
um
listening to music
mhm
bye
