value
yes
okay
atlanta georgia
um in two thousand and six
never
uh i don't like it there <laughter>
oh it's completely boring and there's very little to do
l_a is preferable i think to most places
uh because uh i was engaged to my fiancee and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and
um he loves the water
but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i didn't love florida
and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we could both be happy
and also have um more opportunities in business and
all of the great things that it has to offer
very <laughter> very easy
there's not much i don't like about l_a
i love l_a um i think it feels magical
uh so many creative different people
of all ages
um shapes sizes colors races
um
the mountains the water
uh
the city all the things that there are to do all the people there are to meet i just
i love everything about l_a
no
uh
i'd rather not talk about it
um i didn't go to college
i'm still figuring that out
um
i don't know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really love and i never had a dog
um as an adult i had cats and uh
um i think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't
i really don't want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run
it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more shy although most people would consider me to be outgoing
mm
put on classical music <laughter>
music classical music if i'm especially <ex> especially stressed and
um play with my dog
go for a walk
i think i'm really good at controlling my temper
for the most part
um before i came here <laughter>
um it was just about um
financial stress
uh
um
there's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question
yeah i'd rather not talk about that either <laughter>
i'd rather not talk about that
not very easy at all
um a lot better recently but um
i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so
it's challenging
um not to feel rested most of the time
in the past week i've been feeling a lot better
um yes i um
the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having
um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um
having trouble with tolerating cold
and so i wasn't doing  a lot of the things that i normally do
and i also was sick with the flu
um and in the past week i decided um
that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um
getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um
not isolating so much
and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing
i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and um that uh
in the past week things have taken a more positive turn
no
yes
uh
it's been quite some time officially
it's probably been
i don't know exactly but let's see
maybe more than fifteen years ago
um i was feeling suicidal
no
um because i found a better alternative
um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen
and i've tried a variety of um methods
and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer
and um that was really the first person that
um helped me
uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well
and even though i've struggled with some bouts of
depression it's never been anything
extremely severe and um it was
one of the best things that ever happened
well um i was physically ill
with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person
um because he had cured her of that disease and
um
that was um
he treats multiple issues and so
everything is interrelated so um
once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me
i was so happy
um i felt like i some um
i felt that
i found the answer that i'd been looking for that  i hadn't given up hope and uh
that um
<laughter> i was on cloud nine that i
i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally
found
the answer to the
solution that i was looking for i was like
it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made
i felt
extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time
<laughter> um i went to um
i went to a music store
because uh i had been thinking about
um taking up an instrument i used to play
the violin as a child and uh
i've been wanting to do something
that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed
and um
and so i went to the music store to try out
um to see what it would feel like to
um
to handle an the instrument again
nan
and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue
it was awesome <laughter>
mm
yeah i'd rather not talk about that <laughter>
um
well
<laughter> there's probably a lot but um
i'm always working on being more optimistic um
it's been challenging it takes time but um
yeah i wish i could hear my own
internal voice better
<laughter> yeah i have regrets sure yeah
um
value myself more so that i would make better
relationship decisions
uh
my fiancee is the most positive
person in my life
my ultimate supporter
uh he's i think very unique not uh
not at all selfish and uh
probably a little too giving for his own good but um
always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know
would give somebody the shirt off of his back
um is a genius
in so many ways and uh
um
i'm pretty lucky i think
that
i'm not a quitter
that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i haven't
given up on
taking risks and
um
