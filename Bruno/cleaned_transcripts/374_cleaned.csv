value
yes
pretty good
alexandria virginia
mhm
uh i moved to l_a uh
end of two thousand one
yeah it's crazy <laughter>
um
a couple times a year usually like for holidays
hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um
i think it's a lot more mellow
um it's way more like suburbia
it's nice
um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>
i went to um grad school at u_s_c
um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in
was so intense that
like for the first year
it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so
that made it kind of
um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so
it wasn't bad
film
hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad
i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do
and um
just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about
and um
i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school
um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle>
<sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um
i think that uh
i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of
what um
i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable
um you know full time
nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry
um
and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know
what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting
um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good
place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a
like room to to grow and advance and all that
yeah
<laughter> i can't see your shoes um i
i like to travel um
i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past
done a fair amount
um
i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people
um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know
see
beautiful remarkable
places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle>
um
let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago
um
my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably
that might be like my
favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful
um
and we just spent like
we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing
and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like
we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of
it hit all of the
you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also
i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything
what do i do to relax um
i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will
you know
kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way
um
if i'm home i might just like
you know
throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like
sort of escape relief
um pretty good i don't i mean
eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often
um
the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath>
um
i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was
like judging me unfairly
and that was upsetting
yeah <laughter>
um
it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to
my mom on the phone probably like once a week and
my parents are really supportive <sigh> um
they are
you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time
um so i'd say we have a pretty
pretty good relationship
i guess because i'm like in this
sort of job hunting
phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like
doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've
sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle>
usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good
i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out
but um i've just had more
uh
like nights where
it either
takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason
um
i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know
not that i have been able to identify
i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like
in flux but
i i don't know there was no like event
cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good
feeling
um
not really no
yes
um <sigh>
like <sigh>
i think in like
october or november
although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like
many many years ago <sniffle>
um
i felt like i was
a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it
um <sigh>
just having a hard time
functioning on the most basic
level like just
getting up and
taking a shower
and like going to the grocery store
and you know
answering emails was just like
it took so much energy
um
so yeah i just i wasn't  really
functioning normally
yeah
yes
yes um
<laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so
<deep breath> i think that therapy
is good for me because it
helps me focus on
my sort of patterns um
and also like
ah
just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like
um
kind of just reacting to situations i'm like
mm
just like noticing more what is going on um
and it just helps to
um
i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>
<deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um
i don't know um
i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um
eh maybe over uh
over christmas being at home with my family
yeah
um
well it just was
that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then
and um
like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of
feeling
not
<laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me
um
so when i was there with them it just um
it just felt very like
safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know
warm familial embrace
um <sigh>
<laughter> i think she would describe me as
funny
and smart
and
um
a good listener
nonjudgmental
um
i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter>
okay um
so
this happened
the the last like
job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like
a year and a half close to two years and uh
i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat>
he sort of out of nowhere
uh
mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um
essentially like
the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project
so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah
and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer
and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how
he
i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know
even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore
he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic
decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me
but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic
yada yada so
to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me
um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point
he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me
and later on like a couple of months down the road
i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still
ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um
this guy who
had worked with us a bunch kind of like
if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff
he was doing my job so
yeah so it just like
it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like
that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like
in a way that's like
that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like
angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>
<deep breath> um <sigh> let's see
i um
a very loyal person <deep breath> um
i am
smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um
very like caring kind
um
i'm conscientious
and i work hard <sniffle>
<laughter> uh
man
i think
to uh
be more confident
and
less passive
um
to really
like focus on
what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle>
hmm <sigh> um
probably just some of the
relationships that i formed with people
um
just like really
you know deep friendships
you're welcome
bye
