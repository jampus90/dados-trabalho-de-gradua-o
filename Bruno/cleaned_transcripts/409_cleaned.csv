value
okay
mm
okay
sure
mm
doing okay
i'm from uh l_a
yeah
i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment
yeah
uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag
and um
i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas
i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh
it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it
but uh overall it's okay
uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>
that's why that's my that was my major yeah
um
i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh
it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the
in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um
you didn't see you know too many computers around back then
and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together
you know solving a
a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the
the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um
the problem
mhm
uh
no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time
um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di>
uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um
the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was
i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it
to the degree that i wanted to
wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh
well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time
this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um
at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing
job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much
too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know
i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel
fulfillment on but i don't wanna
too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice
relaxing job
yeah <laughter>
yeah
oh i would say
well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing
um but
i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more
vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much
like once the funny gates open up they kind of
open up too much so i have to like back off you know
but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor
oh really <laughter>
yeah <laughter>
oh um
well i listen to music um
i'll um well i watch t_v um
i'll um
just what what do i do to relax
well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too
i'll be around an area
around
kind of a comfort area where i
i feel safe i can just
dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my
thinking about my own
problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus
on being in the moment with my um
acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances
um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem
it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode
i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more
had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh
uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going
yeah
wow that's a good question
um
i'm not sure to be honest um
i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that
it's not really part of my repertoire
um nothing comes to mind off top of my head
well
um
well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments
back about ten years ago
i was more um
i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people
like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field
and um
i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it
and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity
and um unfortunately i made some bad
financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad
position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up
so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions
that i really regret
wow
hmm
that's a tough one
i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter>
okay
oh
well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um
it's just me and my uncle
and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um
he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida
so uh we're we're okay
but um
uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um
we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep
and uh he's got his own problems
so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation
and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have
so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel
i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in
um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem
and um
i have
a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom
and um
so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a
long story short <laughter>
um
it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired
or achy
so it is it is difficult
uh <sigh>
well i've been feeling okay i mean um
i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um
i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't
taken uh responsibility for
but um
i feel a bit of calmness as of late
no
well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um
i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h
the minnesota multifaceted
personality something of whether
this is going back about six months ago
they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my
my well being psychologically too and i think some of the
the answers said that they
advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist
i didn't follow that
up on that because
of philosophical differences
but uh i think i might have a you know
a mild case of depression
well you know um
like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh
i'm doing okay but i you know i
kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my
my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone
i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to
and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh
there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties
so um
you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to
wow
that's a good one <laughter>
really happy um
let me think about that a minute
well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth>
okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer
um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow
it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh
we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters
giving out really nice samples
it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a
and um
you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like
have me experience their product or service
and um
i was around people that
i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh
i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh
about a month ago
yeah
yeah it was
best friend
i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh
i would say um
hmm
i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh
i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>
um
i i like to be conscientious i
you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall
i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know
say little white lies or you know
i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic
um
i tend to be
pretty calm for the most part
um
what do i regret
well can you elaborate that <laughter>
uh well um
i just well just overall um
i regret uh
not being a little more assertive in in my earlier
uh earlier life um
and kinda put myself in this position
it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life
i made some bad decisions and unfortunately
i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like
sort of like
living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing
so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all
well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um
i think
i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice
i was kinda going away from
my basic
beingness you know like the way i really felt
like for example i'd make i would do aggressive
uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been
well off for the rest of my life <laughter>
but unfortunately it went the opposite way
too too many eggs in that basket
so i kinda regretted going with
my gut feeling and and let other people influence me
and uh
'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments
in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some
aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much
kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret
yeah
wow
that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter>
<laughter> well
i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually
you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows
but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um
you know i'd like to
go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game
uh go to a movie
go out with some friends
so i would just or you know just kinda kick back
but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on
you know earning earning money on the weekends
uh
that's interesting
most proud of
um
i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really
bad
bad uh
vice
um
you know i
i lived a pretty wholesome <wholeso> wholesome life i'd say that'd probably
i don't know if it's really proud um
but as but as far as i stayed the course as far as
uh not going down any real deep <laughter> alleys so to speak
okay
my pleasure
