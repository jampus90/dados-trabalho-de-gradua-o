value
yes
uh doing okay doing okay
uh north carolina
yep
uh almost four years ago
um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since
yep
uh probably three <th>
at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there
mhm
um uh it's
l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and
seeing some friends um but um i i feel more
i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home
uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh
i the <th> i like the resources there i like feeling um
i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be
in north carolina so it i feel like i'm uh
uh i'm able to uh pursue
eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina
uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um
resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston
so uh it's not the worst but um
uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably
drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but
i can't really change geography
uh
<laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production
uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer
um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the
uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could
make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now
i do um i love traveling i try to uh
go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently
and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so
mhm
uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you
uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and
knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or
and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to
just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created
uh yeah sure i went to uh
barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out
and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks
and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i
mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world
i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing
even virtual people
oop
i lost ya
um to relax i uh
listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to
go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy
cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh
sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh
um uh pretty simple tastes
yep
this is awkward isn't
um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can
kinda formulate how i feel and why i'm feeling that way and what
i want to be done about it so uh so it's pretty
i guess i'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect
<sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like
uh misremembering when uh
something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled
uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like
trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person
thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged
uh i guess in the classical sense of the word
um <sigh>
i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um
um i just recently did a uh uh a project
like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it
uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was
doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um
uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um
but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let
uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so
just my thoughts there
hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh>
uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh
ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh
break up with her after some stuff happened and
um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to
uh to uh
break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh
uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory
ugh just
a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so
uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um
i uh
yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now
um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help
but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or
um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very
big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh
uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i
if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so
um
uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um
uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next
um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little
um
uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh
um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of
the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a
group of people or or company um
carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee
how do i cope with
them um
i assume you mean i guess
uh
people i work with how do i cope with the
uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to
how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and
you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the
uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it
then uh it's progress right
uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh
um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check
throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to
follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel
um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that
uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling
uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh
and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself
but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist
uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all
had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or
cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a
a symptom so um
uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression
uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh
um
i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and
i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good
good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly
and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that
uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so
oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't
you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis
um <sigh>
i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh
uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me
and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very
kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child
i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to
um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh
um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of
you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with
uh the man he is
<psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six
um
uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old
but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where
so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so
i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control
how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so
uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i
um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid
depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh
i'm low and uh i treat it as such and
i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i
i have a i'm a i'm a pretty
like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i
mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and
i'm just a smoking gun of
sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh
um i don't i don't lose sight of uh
the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so
mm
um i was on a my uh
my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um
yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh
um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and
then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like
lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have
someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right
um
<sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh
i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care
uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and
i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them
and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm
probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have
thanks ellie
bye
