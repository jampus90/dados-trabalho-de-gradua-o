value
yes
uh i'm fine today today is my daughter's birthday
california
yes
um the beach
i love the waters
the gang violence
violence
um i lost a lot of friends growing up in
um through elementary and high school
just losing them through gang violence
yeah thank you
it was pretty tough out there <laughter>
um
haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really
um i'm an optician i'm a certified optician
and i also have my associate's degree
um actually i went in
i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied
i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful
um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything
um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i
i always thought like they were so cool 'cause their white long lab coats
to be a optometrist
um 'cause i'm already an optician and that's like the first step
and um what i why is a good question it's because
then i would have a be able to have my own business
and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter
and she wouldn't have to really want to anything it would be like a
a family business but a a to help the community as well
and something i could leave for my daughter
uh my daughter she's five years old
uh she'll be starting elementary school next week
and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her <laughter> um she is
very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um
she's adorable she's my heart
no
this is like the hardest job ever <laughter>
it's very hard
providing
providing uh making sure that
you wash their clothes um 'cause 'cause i mean it's hard enough
to be um a parent but i'm a young parent and
i'm a little more mature than her father so
it's um
it's it's the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so
complicated let alone um
it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um
even being here today i probably would've still been in bed but today is my daughter's party
and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to
make sure that she has a good day so
it's all about uh going the extra mile
doing anything that you can do to provide <pro> to provide for them but it it's a very hard job
um
that moment of the day
when your child tells you how much they care about you
and um
my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and
how many
i mean just call your name it just
it's a sense of reality um
to be called mom or to call call dad and
it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what i'm living right now and
it's a it's a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent
thank you
um
a lot of different things i'm actually
taking care of my daughter <laughter> um
i'm here with her uh
i was raised by my grandparents so
i mean i didn't really i didn't get to know my mom til i was sixteen and
my father i mean i couldn't point him out
on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is so
i feel that um
i'm very different from them because
no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up
yeah
um
i guess i
there's been <yawning> oh excuse me um there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive
in my life i can say
um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field
she's in the uh she's an l_v_a
and um she's one of my older sisters
um i can say
me believing in god
being in my life god being in my life has
also kept my strong and to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and
um
hm
i don't know
i don't really look up to a lot of different people because
people lie so
and that's the most what i could think that's been positive for me
i think i'm outgoing <laughter> i used to be shy
um coming up as a kid and
i don't know i don't know what happened to me
uh one day i just broke out of my shell and
i've been um
very accurate of
showing my personality off <laughter>
um
i actually like
for
the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach
and i like to just sit there
and just zone out everybody else that's there
and rub my toes in the sand
and that is so relaxing
um <yawning>
excuse me sorry about that um
i learned not to uh 'cause it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or someone else's
and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper
is showing that i'm in charge of my life
so i don't even let stuff get to me
i don't even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because that's how much i try to block out the
the negativity
mm probably my husband <yawning>
my daughter's father um
uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh
physical altercation like with another human being no
wow
um being honest
i kind of feel guilty
about how things like uh basically how things ended
um before my mom passed i wish that
i could've
helped her a little more
even though people tell me not to feel bad
um because she wasn't really there for me growing up
but i kind of feel guilty like you know
not being there as much as i could've been for her
before she passed away so
i think that's something that i um i still feel guilty for
um
going through my mom passing away
um
i felt like <clearing throat> i felt like um
basically that
it was i felt kind of
robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and
i grew up with my grandparents and then
for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad
for me to get eighteen years old and then then she leaves me
it was kind of like um
i don't know it was nerve wracking because
i felt
robbed you know it was like
i didn't have her all these years and then now that i'm older and i'm i don't even have her now
so
um
signing the paper of having a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter
i was so nervous so scared
um really didn't know what to do how to take it
and i mean like that was so scary
um it was the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world
yes
it's hard <laughter> i didn't even sleep last night
that's why i'm yawning <yarning> but um
uh i i kind of tend to
try to do everything and i have to get
back to that stage where
i have to think about myself as well
and give myself time
um a little like this
but actually i'm a little nicer today <laughter>
um
just groggy
um <yawning>
lately i've been feeling very confident
about um being positive about
going the extra mile of being a good parent
uh
<yawning> yeah i actually really don't care what other people think anymore
i used to let that bother me but i don't no more
no
no
um
uh today 'cause
i was so happy that i brought <brung>
my daughter into this world today on her birthday
um getting to know people
mhm mm not at the moment
if i go
uh to watch who i associate with
my weight <laughter>
uh
i would say my grandma
mm
um uh
uh it's it's just
uh i'd rather not
um my daughter
that's my pride and joy
wow thank you
bye
