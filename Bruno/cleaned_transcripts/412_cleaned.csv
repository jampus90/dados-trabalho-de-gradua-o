uh last year i i uh met a girlfriend up in uh san francisco and drove down highway one and uh
saw a lot of uh sights
hearst castle things like that
uh computer science
uh well i went to school back in the eighties and uh computers were uh
kind of a new new up and coming thing so decided to to do that

uh probably um
i think to have like a little uh little magazine
uh
well i've started already started it it's like a small uh local magazine that has uh coupons and uh
going to expand it to different uh parts of california
probably shy
um
mm well let's see

i guess not as outgoing as many of my friends
um
actually i uh go dancing i like dancing
it's relaxing to me
uh uh uh i do latin dancing so i do it several times a week so last weekend i went
very good
um i i think i argued with someone a couple of weeks back it was about a religion religious issue
um
felt okay
mm
um
see
can't think of one right now <laughter>
let's see
maybe uh when i was doing one of my real estate sales
um
i was um
sometimes the clients are pretty uh pretty difficult
and i think i should've been like a little more uh
assertive with them
mm
probably uh moving to california
well i was uh leaving my friends and family in texas
and um just pretty much starting a new life out in california out here
uh well it was it was pretty difficult but you know i got adjusted
well um
i have only an aunt and a few cousins left so uh it's it's not too much a relationship i have a a a great a uh an aunt
that's the sister of my mom
and uh
you know i
send her texts periodically but uh most of the time i really don't have  much uh contact with family
um
probably parents
both of them were very supportive
mm
probably when the parents were sick
and passed away
no
uh well i both parents were um
uh got sick and uh got dementia
and uh it's
you know one parent didn't remember who i was
so it was uh that part was pretty difficult
well they they passed away so it's just uh it's been about ten years so it's uh just
um it's just memories now
mm not too easy
uh
it's just tossing and turning i think all night and uh probably thinking thinking too much about things
uh
probably like the future things like the economy and uh
my work things like that
uh tired
tired <laughter>
mm just uh not as positive
no
no
mm
probably uh
few weeks ago i received a pretty good uh real estate commission so i was happy about that
uh when i'm in l_a um
going to some of the meet up groups or some some of the uh
i like going to whole foods and
and trying some new uh places to go salsa dancing
no
mm
probably to be more uh outgoing
mm
probably be more successful in uh business and be a little more uh
uh outgoing
mm
probably my boss uh he's pretty uh condescending
and um
really likes to belittle people
and uh
<laughter> put him uh put himself as the king
so he he has says a lot of comments to make himself build himself up and uh belittle whoever whoever else is in the room
uh it's
well
usually when you go in
uh he likes to brag on how much money he's made in the business
and uh
then say things like uh
see see how much better i am than you are
uh you've
look how much money i've made this year and and you're the worst piece of shit agent there is
things like that
