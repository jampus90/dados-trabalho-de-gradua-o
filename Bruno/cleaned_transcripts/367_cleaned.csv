value
yes
i'm okay um
i'm a little
pensive i guess a little
uh down but
more or less okay
i was born in annapolis maryland
on the east coast
originally i moved because i went to film school um
and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again
it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um
but living
l_a is very has a very different kind of
um
attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i
but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here
uh not at all um
when i left things got things were sort of i
i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um
to be with
uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of
i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of
not really speaking to my family or old friends that often
it's not easy it's
it's kind of um
i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job
um i miss um some friends um
i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot
um i feel like i failed
and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard
depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable
um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy
so that doesn't really answer your question but
um [clears throat]
i have certain
i do i do a lot of writing
um i have certain
music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can
when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of
happening really um
it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess
um
a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel
and when i was really
when i was really getting into writing it and um
it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed
um
it was about a
guy who is searching for
something it's
it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he
that he
met and just
was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because
sort of uh it's sort of romantic
adventure comedy kind of thing
well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting
um so i wrote some screenplays and uh
you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer
just creative writing so
i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to
to really hit me
it's not easy the [exhale]
the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um
i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i
hate it because it's so difficult
um
but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good
good i don't i don't really have a temper i
it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people
um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can
lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much
try to it when i'm upset
i i get upset with myself not with other people
um
last night i guess well <weh> um
i got in an argument about whether or not
cleaning vegetables was necessary because of
i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay
so it turned into this
big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i
i ended up being wrong on that one but
it is
yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument
um
uh
a lot so much um
uh
i
i
i was in uh a relationship that i really really
um
that i really wanted to work
and
uh
i ended up and it was partly due to
i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going
at like everything sort of spiraled out of
control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't
i wasn't mean but i was
but i was getting more and more messed up
and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not
and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again
so
that was pretty that was pretty tough
well some of it was was that
i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's
completely kind of i mean i still get
i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not
i don't completely lose it for days at a time
um
so
i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then
i would've i would i would be
i would be
it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have
i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different
things being how they were
i mean it's
it's possible uh
i mean obviously
yeah because i mean that's what i do i i
take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until
until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff
um
and it's like any little detail that comes up
i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still
i still get
i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school
which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there
well it's it's not
easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by
by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way
um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better
um well like i said i do a lot of
you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost
be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely
um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be
you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just
keep my mind occupied during all of that
um
i just need i mean
i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet
they're triggered by everything
pretty much anything that i that i see if i
if i
if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about
just
anything you know i can reach back and connect
to
to this it's really it's really
i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break
from it
yeah
um
i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i
awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally
you know don't
i don't know i never really needed much sleep so
it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep
like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work
um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly
you know i get up i toss and turn all night
you know and now
it's just
it's
yeah i don't sleep too great right now
um
pretty i mean
i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i
i usually just kind of power through it and just
i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel
bad
um
i think
about three three four years ago
um
it was when i
i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for
for
years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got
this
situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like
even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so
so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately
it happened after everything uh went bad so
i don't know
in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel
it really makes me
angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm
that i had to that i i lost everything because
because of
chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control
and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't
it was it didn't help it didn't work until
until
you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but
it was a little it's a little late now
um
there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was
it was either
i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different
but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after
after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off
but it was at least
that and not
firing me
but but but yeah but so i got help but it was
but it wasn't soon enough
uh not
not as much as i should
um
i go to a couple of
meetings
i go to i go to a_a so that i can
um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that
um unfortunately you know being unemployed
my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so
you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing
somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really
very
i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so
it's basically to keep my medication coming
and then there's you <laughter>
right
well like i said i mean
just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now
um just saying stuff outloud is just
like getting getting this stuff out
trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense
that you can actually deal with
is a big step like
regardless of who
you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that
stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can
talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing
yeah
um
you know better than i than i have been um i mean
it it sort of
it goes <g> it has its ups and downs
um you know i'm applying for jobs
five six jobs
or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview
never even getting close to
to to being self sufficient again
um
it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control
so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is
it just has its it's just its own own challenge
yeah
um
it was probably you know a couple years ago
um
i i was
i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind
uh
is
everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close
we were having fun together
and we went out and got a christmas tree
and
we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just
feeling like a part of somebody's life
and feeling like a part of the bigger
the bigger life
that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel
you know for that instant i felt like
a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and
you know everything was going really well and
i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person
a normal happy person
and
part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that
i don't know if i'll ever feel that again
so
um
probably the
probably this
educational <educary> educational series i did uh
an educational
uh video series i did for the national science foundation
um
it was
it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and
you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um
and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to
the world
oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um
it was it was a
we were trying to come up with
with new ideas uh
for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know
to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big
you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um
and there was a lot to it and so
it was probably the biggest
project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it
right that doesn't yeah
um
i guess
i don't know <laughter> uh
i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i
i i i don't know
thank you
