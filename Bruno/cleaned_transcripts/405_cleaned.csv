value
hello
yes
okay
not
too bad
i'm from chicago
south side
um back in nineteen seventy eight
when i was eighteen
yes <y>
lately
not much maybe once every two or three years
um it's totally different you know
horrible weather and uh
yeah it's just a whole different atmosphere
um
let's see my mother had moved to africa
i graduated from high school
and i had a friend out here so i just thought well let me try l_a
uh very easy actually yeah i loved it from the moment i got off the airplane
yeah
number one the weather
um sun is very important to me
so i love the weather
um i don't know just kind of a more laid back atmosphere
variety
of people
and now it's my um
my home base you know
my
friends
that are family
so it's kinda like my family is here now
hmm
i guess the smog earthquakes
um
traffic
just basic things like that really
um i don't currently but i did throughout my life i traveled
quite a lot
uh just seeing
seeing
other cultures and
seeing um more history and
meeting  people and
just fun and the the fun of it as well
um let's see well one trip
i went to
england
ireland and scotland and france all in
you know
one trip
so that was a nice variety
um
i guess you could say probably skiing
in val d'isere france
that was fun
i'm glad i got to do that
i'm kind of shy by nature
i've tried to grow out of being shy so
i'm not fully shy but i was always a an extremely shy
child
but now here in culver city this is my
environment and i i guess you could say i'm not really shy in
in my hometown of culver city
hm
to relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap
watch t_v
sometimes on the couch in the living room
just you know stay at home and
kinda vegetate
uh pretty good yeah my temper's pretty level
hm
probably with my
husband
and
i can't remember at the moment what it was about
um well when you say my family do you mean
my  family from childhood or my current family
okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters
and
my relationship's pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which uh
you know
going they're going through a lot of hormones and
um
they can be kinda bitchy <laughter> and
and um but i have hoped that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship
um and then there's the husband which
i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon  <laughter>
we need to get a divorce but we're still together
due to financial reasons
and yeah
yeah so that that's not good the
the relationship with the husband but um
but since we have determined that we need to divorce
our our we don't expect anything out out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good
hm
well
i guess
our marriage
i wish i had noticed early on that
you know it was like way off from what i thought it was
um <sigh> let's see oh my god
hardest decision
i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard
um well you know we were married and i wasn't
content i guess you could say
um and
i kinda just
gave up on our relationship and
i i now that i look back i think it's because
i wanted
children and he would've been happy to never have any
and so uh since i didn't have a father
it was very important
that i
create children with someone who really wanted to be a father
and so i was kind of
at a age where i needed to start thinking about
having children
yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that
i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just
felt like
<tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and
so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and
<tisk> um
<tisk> and i had to leave him
because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very  hard 'cause
you know
i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's  married with two kids <laughter>
<laughter> but um
it was
hard
to leave him
mm
something i wish i could erase from my memory
i have to think about that
i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well
yeah there's um
i guess it'd be nice to erase
from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event
in my
recent adulthood here in culver city
where one of my best friends
um
i've betrayed me by
back years ago when my husband first got into real estate
she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home
and
um
we just assumed that you know that they would use
my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time
and purchase a new home
<tisk> and as it turned out
they surprised us and
had been talking to this other local agent
and uh yeah
that was devastating
i don't think i had ever  been betrayed
like that
so i wish i could  erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young
and um
my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say
six maybe
um
maybe five
anyway her <h>
her and my best friend's
daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other
we were pregnant together
and um
they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd
run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were
just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her
their moms weren't talking to each other anymore
so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together
and they're still very connected in fact <laughter>
she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter
and another girl
and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now
these girls are
becoming really good friends better friends
um
and yet
i still have this
vivid
um
bad memory
of what her
her mom did to
to me
that was about what
ten
about eight years ago
anyway
<sigh> i tried to i tried to
ignore it and put it out of my head and
which i've been able to <sniff>
in recent years
but obviously it still comes up
anyway that that was that
um not that easy
i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but
sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up
and can't get back to sleep
uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that
that difficult thing
well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter>
and then um
<tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom
so i guess that's the trigger
as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there
i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind
running through my mind and the day
i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so
it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to
i guess
um
well i'm kinda used to it now
so i just go on
through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um
i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do
and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have
huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something
read my book watch t_v watch whatever
lately how have i been feeling um
kind of down
on myself down on life
well i have this pending
need <n> need for separation slash divorce
um
<tisk> i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers
you know on the verge of adulthood
and so i worry that
you know
i did all kinds of things wrong
with their guidance and their early childhood and  <clears throat> now it's too late
um
like i missed out on a thing <th> a lot of things
uh
and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i wanna do with my life
i know i wanna do something i i
i just wish
you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff
so i i regret that extremely
and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself 'cause i need to
divorce and move on with my life
so
now i forget what the original question was but  <laughter>
um
that's the state
part of the state of my life
no
yes
mm <tisk>
well
the first time or or or recently
the first time i guess was
you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little
upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then
i was um
<tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i
you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him
and i didn't understand this feeling
i was really upset
how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really
recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i
had the
knowledge or the
i was able to
take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour
and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me
and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as
i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter> you know
um
yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed
and put on meds
that was probably about
two years ago
no
um money i i don't have insurance
otherwise yeah i'd be happy to
go to therapy <laughter>
anything that might help
ooh <laughter>
boy
last time i felt really happy
um
i don't know i guess maybe
when my children were born
that's
um
i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just you know
i always wanted children so it was nice
to have them
that's
i don't know that's all i can remember of that i don't i guess i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times
mm
something i did that i really enjoyed
well
let's see i um
friday night i went to a friend's house
and met up with
five other girlfriends and we
we created vision boards
and talked and
had dinner
at one of their house that was that was fun
yeah
we get to
ooh <sigh>
stay in college get my degree
um
get therapy try to become a happy
um
yeah try to figure out things earlier in life
like
yeah
stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like
as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the
songs go you know
it's all about money the world revolves around money and
having none
that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life
having no money
is
you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it
so
with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree
and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it
um
don't quit
to go traveling you know
just stick with a job stick with a company build up your
seniority keep your benefits
and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field
yeah that would've been
my biggest piece of advice to myself
not much <laughter>
i guess
just my daughters you know they're
beautiful daughters and
i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people
aren't even able to do that you know and they  try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so
that's the one thing i mean i wanted
five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but
um i'm
i guess that's the
biggest thing i can
think of to be proud of
is having my two daughters
um
i'm a very loyal
friend and person
that's why
when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating
yeah very loyal um
very
<inhale> happy <hap> i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky <l> go lucky i don't know where that came from i'm very i meant to say friendly
and
caring and
um yeah i care about people
and i'm interested in people
and
i care about
animals as well
actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian
yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian
i'm a vegetarian because i really care about
feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and
you know i don't think that animals should be  tortured
and live a a tortuous life
just so we can eat 'em
so um
what was the question
do you remember the question
okay
you're welcome
bye
