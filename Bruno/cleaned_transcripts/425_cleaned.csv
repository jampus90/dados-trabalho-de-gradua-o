value
yes
i'm okay i'm feeling a little tired and uh
worried
um
well i'm looking for a place to live and um i don't have a job right now so
things are <sigh> things are a little
shaky for me
i'm staying with my son in venice
uh it's pretty good but uh both of us need to have our own space so that's why i'm looking for another place to live
originally from new york but i've been in california since the early seventies so
yeah
uh i moved to l_a because i had been living in portland oregon and i was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seemed like a good place to be
um it wasn't too hard i uh i met people right away and um
i just really like it here so it was uh it was easy to connect with people
the weather is <laughter> number one like for most people i love being near the ocean
um
i like the energy i like the um i like the artistic culture
mhm
uh well everybody loves the traffic i mean loves the weather and hates the traffic so i kinda feel <fee> i feel the same way um
sometimes it
it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult
uh no not as much as i'd like if if i had more funds <fu> more income more funds i would travel more
um <sigh> well mostly i've been um
xxx i traveled let's see so my longest uh trip that
was out of the country was to mexico and i traveled
drove down with a friend uh down to oaxaca
and the whole trip we took about mm i think we
took us about four weeks going down and back from uh the bay area
um yeah that was a fun trip
well uh we'd been working together on the census and she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her
um from that trip i would say we were in oaxaca for day of the dead
so it was uh celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in and
everybody in the village makes an altar in their house uh for their
uh loved ones who have passed away
and um
they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that
uh
well i studied <studi> i was in the liberal liberal arts program but i didn't stay <st> i stayed only stayed in school for uh in college for a couple of years
um but i was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities
huh my dream job would be uh personal assisting somebody who
was in a creative field
and getting to uh travel and go to events with them
uh it's hard to break into um i i'm starting now very uh minimally with somebody who i'm doing more of a
volunteer
work with and i'm i'm working on building up some of my skills so that i can be doing more of that
i'm fairly i'm kind of a friendly introvert so um i i'm you know i have no trouble meeting people uh i don't hold back and um
you know xxx just i'm not shy <sh> like shy at parties i'll go up and talk to people
um
but i i am overall kind of introverted so um
i prefer one-on-one
than
big groups
um
i like to watch uh well i <laughter> i like to watch uh improvement shows like on uh h_g_t_v i like to watch um
like remodel shows and and see transformations or or watch movies
or read
oh and and i play some solitaire on my uh my kindle fire
um
i don't usually realize i'm mad until later <laughter> so <laughter> it doesn't really come up um
and i i just tend not to have the kind of life where
um
those situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road
um i get a little annoyed uh i don't get annoyed so much at like when people cut me off or anything like that um
but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or um
you know when they get angry because maybe i've done something inadvertent you know cut them off by mistake and they <the> you know like
they get really angry then that makes me angry in return
hmm <sigh>
um
yeah like i said i don't really get into arguments um
i did have <ha> i was with a friend the other day and um
she got annoyed with me because she felt like i was correcting her
so it wasn't really an argument but she
you know i had said something that
she heard as a correction well it was a correction
and she got angry um but
um
well then i felt criticized and i felt i felt vulnerable
eh i wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable
hmm
um
well i
in that situation
i didn't i didn't have to correct her
um
so <sigh>
i think that's something i'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right
so in general
that's i'm trying to to catch that and
just let people
make mistakes without <laughter> without my telling them about it
mm
hmm
boy i don't know um
gee that's tough
i can't i don't know that i've had that much trouble making decisions um
hmm
well uh <u> uh
was
hard for me to decide
to uh
put my cat to sleep when he was sick
oh it was <wa> and i had to give up a cat um
when i was moving once and
and that was difficult too 'cause
um <sigh>
well in the case of the first cat the one who was sick um
i decided when the vet
said that he thought it was the humane decision
um
and with the cat i had to give up i didn't
i
didn't really decide um i was moving to a place that
where i couldn't take her
and so i
i found somebody who could take her
hmm <sigh>
mm
see
um
gee that's tough
if i don't really eh the the erasing from the memory part um
there's nothing i really wish i could erase from my memory
um
trying to think of something that i've done that i
wish i hadn't done
um
oh okay i remember something there was <wa> <laughter> there was a time when i was
i was in a class at junior college it was a film class
and uh
i was i was the one who was um after we we went out and did a little film project
um
and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week uh i was the one who had the film
and through different
just things that were happening in my life right now i never went back to the school but i never
brought them the film back so all the work they had done
um they had to do over again and i still feel bad about that
eh it's pretty easy um sometimes i wake up
in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often
i've been feeling kind of tired and low level depressed and like not feeling a lot of options
no
yes i have
uh well there were two times there was once um back in like nineteen seventy
two nineteen <ninetee> yeah about nine nineteen seventy two or three and then um
another time um
oh so then when would that've been about sixteen years ago
um
just feeling like there wasn't um
you know feeling that feeling that things weren't gonna change
if i didn't get some help and that if i
i didn't have to you know that maybe if some <s> i got some medication that would help me
um
in the short term
so
i'm not going to therapy right now
uh i was moving around a lot finances i wasn't really feeling the need um i'm starting to think it might be a
an option again
i feel like therapy can be useful yes
well when i went to therapy um
it was helpful to have somebody who listened and
could also
offer impartial suggestions for helping me to
improve the way i was feeling
um <sigh>
well i was on the beach last weekend
uh it was a beautiful day and i was sitting in the sun and uh
just relaxing and i had my notebook and i was doing some writing and
i felt very happy and content
uh i'm kind and compassionate and i'm a good listener
and i'm intelligent and i have uh i have good ideas
um <sigh>
well i wish that uh
sometimes i wish i was <wa> i was a harder worker um i'm not really willing to take
low wage jobs even though
i i need work so i just don't feel like i'm willing to do anything
um
and um
i wish i could act i i said i had good ideas that um i have good ideas and i'm good at the
uh the onset but i'm not really good on the follow-through so
a lot of those ideas get started but then
i don't take them the distance
that's probably the the thing i'd like to change about myself the most
uh ten or twenty years ago i'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree
finish my education
um
and be willing to um
to work
a regular job and to um
to start putting money
away for my
uh retirement
um proud of uh my children and i'm proud of the friendships i have
and i'm proud that um
eh that
people eh people do eh admire me um and value my opinion
goodbye
