value
yes
i'm doing well
los angeles the greater los angeles area
people
diversity
and
various entertainment and activities
um fickle weather
traffic
and litter
i have traveled domestically not internationally
seeing other places and how people live and the culture
the last trip that i went to was san diego
but uh
from childhood or as an adult
um family vacations to um baja and rosarito beach
yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because um
this weekend is easter and we usually will go
down to easter <east> easter spring break
to rosarito baja
um i have a bachelor's <b> bachelor's in communication studies
because it's a open field
just doesn't deal with um
communication interactively but performing arts
telecommunications
business entrepreneurship so
no i'm not i'm actually unemployed
um
i think to own my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company
um
i would like to open something in like the telecommunications area
as a business
something do online online services
um i like to make things with my hands
so my next venture would
would be to create all natural soy candles
something in that area
um a mixture
a mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people and crowds
and that's how i usually make a determination if i
remain reserved or remain open
i listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk
or go get a massage
fair
oh man <laughter> uh probably yesterday or this morning
um
usually the argument is about
me making myself clear
or me repeating myself twice
no it usually gets the other person in trouble
mm
i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission
and i had a warranty
and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs
and the guy offered me a portion of
the settlement agreement
and i decided to take him to small claims court
to get a bigger amount
and i wish i would've have
taken the offer that he gave me
at the midst of
dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs
and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing
the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion
so i wish i would've
taken the higher
road than taken the lower road
i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things
hardest decision
uh i don't know financially emotionally
mm
emotionally letting go a past relationship
it's the hardest thing that i
i won't say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing
yes it was a relationship of seven years
but um that person has already moved on
so
uh they want me to be in their life
in hopes that
if something goes wrong with my current relationship
we'll always have something to fall back on
uh yeah it is hard
um an event
something i could erase from my memory
um
i don't know <laughter> there's a lot of events
that i just automatically erase from my memory but whatever comes to mind right
um
probably the death of a relative
um alone and misinformed
because i didn't know that they were that sick
and i didn't know that they were um their days were numbered
and i could've had more opportunity to
spend time with them and make
better a better connection in the last days
um
it's fair to midland
mm
my immediate i'm very close but distant not very close
my mother
um yes uh she's encouraged me to
continue my education
to always fall back on my
hobbies hopes goals and dreams
she always encourages me to
always stay aloof and
out there looking for a better opportunity
and she encourages me to
not be afraid to
explore other ventures
easy <laughter> easy <laughter>
i've been feeling well
um
yes a little stressed but i'm trying to manage that
i leave the stressful environment
um
in the past
about three years ago
um
because i was having issues in my learning environment
and um i feeling <f> i was feeling
emotionally attacked
yeah i was having uh a issue with a professor who
was just very
i don't know a a very different personality
and
he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school
i felt
i felt um like i was in a a dishonest environment
i felt
like i wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class
but i had no choice but to stay in there
and deal with his meanness for the whole semester
um i think through finding p_t_s_d they were trying to link depression
no
financially
i'm not capable and i haven't found a counselor who is willing and committed
to working with me and helping me with my issues
i find that a lot of counselors they listen to me
and then they laugh at me and then they tell me
the opposite of what's
what i'm telling them
mhm
mm
last time i felt really happy
i really don't know
that's a good question
um
just just did what i want i just relaxed
i just relaxed and
i you know i don't know <laughter>
i don't have any best friends
my best qualities that i'm uh hard working i'm reliable
i'm a excellent friend
um
i'm energetic
and i'm a go getter
things that i wish i could change about myself
probably be less sensitive
don't take things so personally
and um
learn how to help myself before helping others
no i don't have any regrets in my life
um if i could've do things differently ten years ago
i probably would've
focused and studied more
and less
being out of the house and
hanging with friends
mm that i got have a a college education
and i'm self sufficient
and
i can pay my bills by myself <laughter>
and
i'm alive
goodbye
