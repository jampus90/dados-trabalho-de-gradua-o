value
yes
i'm doing pretty good thank you
i was born in the san fernando valley in california
really
uh i love the beaches
i like uh there's just many things to do
and uh you can't beat the weather
uh
traffic cost of living
uh no i haven't uh
i've only been out of the country once
or a few times actually but only to one other country
mm
well
they were when i was younger before i turned twenty one and we used to uh
go to tijuana across the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that
uh well i love to see new things new places uh and uh have new experiences
uh after high school i went to beauty school
for cosmetology
mm
well at the time i was uh
looking for a career change and uh
i have some friends in the industry and uh
i decided to take the classes and see see what i thought
uh
only as a hobby
mm
well uh
that's a that's a tough one to answer i'd have to think about that
i would be on the outgoing side
uh just because
i'm more outgoing than i am shy <laughter>
uh lotta times i smoke marijuana
mm
not the best
uh
i had an argument with my mother over
uh
how we should handle doing things with my grandmother
well we just had differences on
uh
who should do what at what times and who's in control and uh
i should pretty much let her
uh
follow her rules because it's you know she's her daughter
well it's okay i understood we talked it out and
you know realized that uh i might've been uh
overstepping my bounds
uh it's
fairly good i am pretty close with my mom and uh my grandmother
i have a stepfather and a half-brother
we get along okay but we're not very close
and i've never met my real father
um
maybe not accomplishing as much as i
should have in my life up to now
uh
yeah maybe
by not having enough uh ambition or drive to
be in a better position in my life
uh
well one of the hardest decisions was when i moved moved uh away from los angeles to wisconsin
well when i was younger i was getting in trouble and i was looking for a way out so i
went and continued getting into trouble and i <deep breath> with a friend <sigh> uh we just packed our bags and moved to milwaukee
yes
uh extremely difficult
i guess uh
i got a lotta things going on
or not going on and it just makes it hard for me to sleep
um issues in my life
and uh
sure sometimes
mm i guess it depends on what i have to do
right now
a little
well in the last few minutes since we started talking about
depressing stuff
i starting to feel a little more down
i haven't
no
mm
very seldom
<psh> stop thinking about 'em
mm i don't know
i couldn't tell i couldn't answer that right now
um
i guess i felt uh
eh it's been awhile since i've been really happy
i don't have uh a whole lot of very happy thoughts as recently
mm
oh let's see i <sigh> did go to las vegas
uh a couple months ago
i had a good time there
well i'm a
honest person
for the most part reliable
uh
i think i'm easy to get along with
wow where do i start
i have plenty of uh
bad decisions i could
erase
um
yeah well i have a d_u_i on my record
uh well
for the time it suspended my license makes it extremely difficult <diff> makes life extremely difficult
well yeah it's uh
hard to get around when you can't drive legally
and if you do drive illegally you're at risk of going to jail
for driving without a license
uh
well the original charge did but i haven't
got caught driving
since
mm i don't have a best friend
mm
well let's come back to that one
mm maybe that i could uh
follow through with some of my plans
be a little more ambitious
maybe not
uh well <we> some of the decisions i've made in my life i have regrets
uh take care of business first
and always handle your responsibilities
good <go> uh
good weather
good music good company
good conversation
mm <sigh>
wow i don't have an answer for ya
i love to
uh
