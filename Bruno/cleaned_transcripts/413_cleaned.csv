value
yes
i'm doing okay
i'm from greenwich connecticut
yes
um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago
um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less
um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general
um
i think that
other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there
are just more my
type and what i'm used to and
it's less superficial
<tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california
um initially it was easy because i felt like
it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just
are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in
how different it is and
what life is out here it became more difficult than originally
uh fine arts and photography
um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and
got awards and things like that and publishments
so i decided to pursue art
um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and
scrubbed_entry
yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um
i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography
i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting
um
that's a interesting question
i guess just my childhood in general
growing up
um well my family's very close
um
my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live
within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that
yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is
more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries
um i consider myself more shy
um
i
watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted
um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and
just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to
um
i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having
if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger
um
well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like
insignificant things
but other than that
um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago
um
there's been like some tension going on
since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter
things about his girlfriend and
he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to
have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways
so for like the thirtieth time he
we were on the phone and he was
<sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and
he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i
i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me
um
i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish
that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue
but the thing is is that he says
certain things that are untrue
or things he knows that like will tick me off
that are really nasty and
that he shouldn't be saying to me so he
so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really
mm like not say anything
um
well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't
i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to
after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically
changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own
so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now
that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made
um
well i wish i could erase
the event or seeing
my grandmother's funeral which
obviously it wouldn't change anything
but
it wasn't
seeing her there was not something i'd wanna
like have in my memory
um she was she was a very positive influence and always
was not judgmental
um
and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people
so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people
they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you
are older
um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep
no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m
i will be up like clockwork
by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to
figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer
no i just
in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's
i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning
<tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring
but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday
um
i don't know i kind of just feel very
mm
like so so
just
no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of
one note land
i mean nothing like lately
um
like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and
just reserved and
not very outgoing
no
no i have been diagnosed with anxiety
um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital
um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but
they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety
i think in the right setting and
with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist
is helpful
and good at what they're doing then yeah
no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid
um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like
deal with whatever issues they were having with me
but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day
it wasn't
i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it
<sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday
when i'm there i can always just
we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to
worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out
just enjoy the day
in general
um
i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't
being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and
the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here
so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or
you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even
that it was more like a transfer school like you
you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went
so it kind of create created more problems for me
well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago
i would give myself the advice to
probably stay closer to home
and to have
really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california
um
my best friend would describe me
as a great charismatic funny outgoing
socially enjoyable person which is different than how
people who aren't my good friends would describe me
which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i
am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just
i am very shy and
don't really
speak much
um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that
yeah
um
i'm very caring
i
i'm a very good judge of character
which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself
um
i'm very affectionate <aff>
i mean
i'm not very affectionate i'm more
i mean i guess i guess so
thanks
