value
yeah go ahead
um i'm okay
i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while then i moved to california
mhm
i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been what eight months something like that
um <sigh>
at the most probably twice a year
um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um
and
i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so
um yeah things were were changing
in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial
um
main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so
so i gave it a shot and here i am
oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um
i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but
you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um
and
yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh
yeah
so
i love to travel i love it yeah i've i i lived in ireland and i traveled um
i was in morocco and i was in costa rica
um i've spent some time in mexico so
yeah
um i love <sigh> meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also
not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go
um sure well
i guess hmm
i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but
morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh
yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun
um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so
my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was
um being on a bus and and leaving
um dublin and going just out to the countryside and
seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but
when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible
yeah
um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies
no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so
i actually do sales
so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into
comes into play and eh so does my
i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach
um
to
guess i'm not clear on the question um
okay
wow um <sigh>
you know my dream job is
being a
a motivational speaker and trainer and coach
um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and
um really contributing to people
um my relationship's pretty good actually i
i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would
not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and
um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother
um last may and we've been
we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so
um
well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother
um
i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so
yeah
i'm shy
um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance
i love to read
i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions
that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else
um
i like to be with friends um
i love art and
trying new restaurants um
yeah all those things are
both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that
um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so
yeah yeah
um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>
um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be
oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery
yeah that was the last time so
yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of
uh it didn't show up
and
uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until
um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and
they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place
so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that
the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so
i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated
oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um
let me think about one
um the other day i had a phone call
and i'm in a coaching program and
it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program
and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with
and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with
um
someone who's not my coach and uh that
hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these
people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to
not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know
so
yeah i wasn't um
i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and
it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but
um
yeah i could've
certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and
would've made the call go a lot smoother
hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few
i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision
no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was
challenging
um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i
moved
uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado
and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been
you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know
um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging
oh lots of things um
i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and
the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um
at the time i was very much into rock climbing
and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were
um in my age group and or single that was another factor um
and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit
so
yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but
um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move
yeah
uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>
relatively easily
it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then
you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today
but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty
anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um
but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily
um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of
out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um
yeah and i just i have to find
the financial means to support me in doing that and it's
and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing
so
yeah
um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation
um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can
there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do
and mm my money's not working at all
so yeah it feels pretty crappy
<laughter> thanks
i have in the past yeah
oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago
i was suicidal
oh yeah i feel down mhm
i don't actually no
um
well i originally stopped
with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had
worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed
and um and then i began therapy again
later on
think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties
um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so
yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous
i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see
and
you know work through that situation and come up with um
a strategy for
not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies
and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever
<deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow
huh
wow that's pretty sad
um it was at least a year ago
no i that's not true it was
when i um
saw my biological mother which was last may
my best qualities
um <sigh>
i'm very strong
very strong-willed
i um
am very supportive and loving and nurturing
um
i'm easy to be around
i'm intelligent
and
um
yeah
anything i regret
i don't think so
no
<sigh> don't take life too seriously
oh my ideal weekend
um i spend some time at the beach i'll spend some time with friends
um either going out at night you know to a movie or
just going out to um
a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together
um maybe go dancing after
um and sundays i usually go to
scrubbed_entry
and then i have brunch with friends and
um
yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so
hmm <sigh>
i am most proud of
um
a few things i mean
i've moved to places that i wanted to move to
and uh so i've done things that have really spoken to me and have
meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually
um
mm achieve those those um
goals or those
yeah i've done things that i've wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california
mhm
okay
sure
bye
