value
yeah i'm totally fine it be confidential or not you know my words <wo> my words are everybody's get wild <laughter>
i'm doing pretty good hanging out nice weather um i just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you <laughter> the the digitial you that i'm saying uh i don't know it's yeah it's funny
um <tisk> because i just always thought that uh the conveying of emotions or feelings uh
be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non human entity such as yourself
yeah
i
i think you see what i mean <laughter> i'm from um born and raised in los angeles venice area mar vista specifically um
that's where i'm from
um well
there's a lot more that i don't like but what i do like is
that public transportation is coming up uh
that the idea of
certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent you know topic very
thought upon and i feel
that los angeles' deep culture is um why i stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to
there's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand <laughter> yeah
um
well the
the human mentality here is um
is very very hectic very chaotic
you know a lot due to
the vehicle the car the freeway
and this idea that we're on
a grind you know this
yeah it's it's a very
it's it's very hectic um
atmosphere human atmosphere that
is not very conducive for a
supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing
yeah
well i can't see your shoes <laughter> but um i love to travel i do love hiking i do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides uh <laughter> i do love to travel yeah
um
from my travels it's not like
well i do enjoy a lot of things about travel but
it's more like what do i
it's it's just more like i i enjoy not being
uh trapped in the city with all these uh
made up ties and restraints i enjoy
traveling because
i get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux image
you know man <ma> man made image that it is here
so i love traveling because i get to get out of this and see the world as it is
thanks <laughter>
would you
<laughter> okay <laughter> um
well i um
kind of recently last year went to
los banos central california area
and although it wasn't that far from l_a it was completely different energy um there was no phones
there was no wifi there's no t_v
there was um
there was sanity there was a relative sanity
in the sense that um
people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and
outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chilling I was working at a hot spring resort
and i just got to breath and hike
and farm and do a lot of carpentry
yeah
um not hard you don't you don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't
um
i guess uh kind of what i described about the city i just wanted to uh
get out of here and
kind of
kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal yeah
um well
currently i'm studying um
currently i'm studying physical therapy i'm about to become a licensed massage therapist but before that yeah kind of cool but before that i was going to
scrubbed_entry
um for music composition so i was just writing scores for
films animations dance productions theater productions
stuff like that yeah it was it was cool it was fun trippy
very trippy um but it was cool but i had to leave that because
tuition hikes
up to you know going up to like fifty thousand a year for like a four year b_f_a
is uh not not the deal not trying to
trap myself with these uh chains of federal loans
so yeah
hey that's not a good word sucks <laughter>
um dream job hm
my dream job would be
anything <exhale> that i can do to
alleviate these uh metropolitan
like cities from
the nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to
incite dream back within
the modern human world
and with you know physical therapy and artistic expression
i've got some
great ideas <laughter> yeah
um
i guess more outgoing i just like i just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah
<laughter> i thought that was really funny um what i do to relax is uh
just kind of breath it out chill maybe make a smoothie or some tea and i go bike riding write yeah
hmm
pretty good i guess i haven't
yelled in a long time
um
well it wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to state my opinion
and have it be understood and i like the person that i'm conversing with to say their
opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was
uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes
things are not ready to be written
yeah so yesterday
hm
guilty
that's tough i haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt
what about you what's something you feel guilty about
okay
mm
i don't really wish i could erase anything from my memory 'cause then that would just
be like
i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if
something just got erased you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah
hmm
um maybe the time
scrubbed_entry
um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just
kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend
and it didn't turn out
you know not all
nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little
uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and
i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up
yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh
maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully
the hardest decision
huh
hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a b_f_a
yeah that could've been the hardest
um
it's just uh i don't
i mean of course money money is the motto money's a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support <s> not a fan of support that
but um
yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um
but another reason why i
decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was
also because um art institute you know um that's a
that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician
being taught by a musician
to
make music
and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know
and it's just um
yeah it's just not
quite as artistic as i thought
art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not not from out there you know so yeah
hm
if i
if i um
it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i
remember to breathe and go through my mantras or
remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um
but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah
um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice
a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice
pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know mm you know medical herbs uh
like chamomile and cannabis and
just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju <laughter>
mm
mm i i guess not if i can't think of something no
i've been feeling
kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a grey line but it's a nice grey it's a really nice hue
um some people wouldn't like this but i really like that and it's uh
it's stable
yeah it's it's comfortable yeah
no no i haven't
not by a certified um medical professional no but no i haven't <laughter>
um
yeah i mean i just think like the whole
you know like you said p_t_s_d depression and you know other you know mental instabilities i think
everybody is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybody's angry
i think everybody's shy everybody's social all at the same time you know it's just
different days different you know variants different floats different boats you know different
waves different swells um so yeah i think
i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know all that but just on different variants different floats
really happy
um
i i mean i feel really happy a lot
uh and i feel really sad a lot but really happy was uh i guess
maybe this morning when i just biking over here just enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze
biking
yeah it is <laughter>
um well i have a lot of best friends and they describe me all all pretty differently but underlying that same idea
that maybe i'm just uh maybe in a nutshell just kind of aquarius i guess
well i'm twenty one so twenty years ago <laughter> i would've told myself to keep being a baby uh stay young
and don't lose sight you know don't stop listening keep letting things happen don't make them happen
be
be a beautiful baby that's what i would've told myself or yeah be a beautiful baby
mm
um
well i guess recently what has been shown to me uh through me by me
is um my ability to work
with others and i'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint i've been uh collaborating a lot with
artists working on a lot of different um mediums mixed media projects and
i'm really comfortable with it and with other peoples and melting our ideas together
yeah
mm
that's a weird question like
um
like that's trying to make me single out
the you know one moment that i today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that i'm not capable of fulfilling today so i think the proudest moment of my life is right now chiling hanging with you
yeah thank you
mm
it's interesting um  my immediate family is uh
mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in south asia
just kind of backpacking around uh younger sis she's really chill she kind of does music too and we just hang out
we're really cool mom mama i'm really chill with love her to death
uh she gets me and dad
uh he
he doesn't get me but
i love the art that he makes he he does crazy painting and i kind of get him through that but uh
uh yeah there needs to be more communication which is being worked upon
hm
cool yeah thanks for wondering about my thoughts
goodbye

push this guy
oh so i could still talk to you
or i could push this button
