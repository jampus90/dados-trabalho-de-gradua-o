value
sure
i'm doing alright
new jersey
yes
three months ago
not very often
uh it's much different
uh
i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here
to start a new life for myself
it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh
it was uh
it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here
i've met some good friends here
um
you know i love the hollywood area um
and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love
hmm
the traffic
not really no i don't
just haven't had the time or the finances to
digital media
well
i've always loved you know
<deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it
no
i dropped out
well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that
uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education
um
but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my
degree in digital media
and uh you know finished
and uh started working you know doing something in that field
a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but
i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but
i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing
listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um
you know play music in my car and that helps me relax
or i smoke a cigarette
oh like what ooh um <laughter>
just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal
well <sigh>
it depends on
how high my stress level is and how angry i am
but i
i do my best to
not get so pissed off <laughter>
scrubbed_entry
and
i don't know she um
she wanted me to to come and pick her up
uh she was a little drunk
and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and
i just ended not picking her up
because of her attitude on the phone with me
yeah
it does
something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids
uh often
or as often as i should
i've just been so busy with trying to
get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to
you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to
you have no idea
um
it's it comes natural but it's no way easy
and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do
but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away
and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a
and i feel bad that i don't see them you know
but
the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them
fear
you know
fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear
that
something awful is gonna happen
and
not seeing them it
brings about that fear a lot more
you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it
it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida
um
and i i at least i used to see them
it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all
and
that's the that's the hardest thing i've had
to do as a parent
is to
step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for
i don't know what my future holds
but
the hardest thing is being
so far away from them
just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day
and they just cheer me right up
i mean
i eh
it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away
and just not seeing their faces that's
it's it's the worst thing ever you know
but
i
i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face
and um
i don't know
well um
i think
the fact that i can
get down to their level
um
i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter>
as a father than my dad was with me my dad was
you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but
you know he was always very reserved
you know
and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because
you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy
um
but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be
but
i always love to
you know play around with them
as much as possible
you know not
i don't want them to grow up too fast
and that that may have been
yeah
well <sigh>
a situation that i wish i would've handled differently
there's so many <laughter>
uh
i guess when i was still with my ex-wife
in florida
i wish i wouldn't have
gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions
she had a tendency to
get underneath my skin
and uh you know
keep picking at me until
i exploded
and
i allowed her to do that
you know i i should've just
walked away when i could
and um you know not let my temper get the best of me
no
no
no
uh sometimes it's hard
um
sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through
with work and you know
making sure
you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent
you know wondering what my kids are going through
you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore
if they even know they have a father
you know
those are some of the things that run through my head and
and that keeps me up at night sometimes
a little <sigh> but <sigh>
you know i put myself in this situation so
you know i i gotta
bear with it you know i gotta
you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh>
i gotta deal with it in my own way
lately
um
i've been trying to
not think so much about
you know all that's going into my life
uh i try to distract myself
and that kind of
gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or
just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know
all the stresses in my life
um
the last time i felt really happy
uh
was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um
with a couple of my friends from work and um
i don't know
we just got
pretty drunk and just <laughter>
that kinda helped me to forget
all the crap that was
previously going through my head
so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that
other stuff
then i'm happy <sigh>
some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter>
um
uh i'm kind of like a
i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends
you know
i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting
or i may
um you know just listen to people so you know eh
i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something
troubling times like like i'm going through
scrubbed_entry
uh who lives in florida
you know i talk to him every now and then and
he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and
you know i just kind of
talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to
you know when i was living in florida
i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me
and now that i'm here in l_a
i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so
he um
he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice
you know about what i think you know he should do
um
so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that
uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff
i don't know <sigh> um
sometimes i wish i wasn't so
kind or generous
it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me
and i may not realize it
and um
i don't like saying no to people i like
to always please people
so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser
sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it
you know
help others and not you know
that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to
pay bills but
i feel better helping people
i don't know
i regret
not
breaking up with my ex-wife sooner
i regret <re> i regret <re>
because she put me through so much crap in my life
and um
i was always trying to
be a people pleaser i was trying to please her
you know trying to
please my kids as much as i can
by not breaking up you know the family
but
you know there's only so much one person can take
and i i think probably if i would've left sooner
i may have been happier
and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did
you know
during all those years with her
so
maybe if i would've got out sooner
i don't know i would've been happier i guess
um
it's okay to be selfish
it's okay to
you know
think about yourself sometimes
you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you
then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy
and even though
pleasing people may make you happy
uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs
because
you know
you play an important role
in
the lives of your close family members
and um
in order to keep everything afloat
you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's
you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so
be a little selfish sometimes it's okay
i don't even know what a weekend is anymore
my ideal weekend would be
locked away alone in my room
watching movies listening to music just
with my
cell phone off and
not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar
you know or you know watching a a metal show
so
i like to be alone
but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people
crazy <laughter>
he thinks i'm uh
i'm crazy for coming out here
but
i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded
and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter
how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out
so
i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight
but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm
crazy but
strong-minded <laughter>
my kids <sigh>
you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy
are my kids and
you know just having them in my life is is the
proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them
in my life
and although i don't get to see them as much
even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know
how far they've gone
you know
what what they've accomplished in their you know
in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy
and i can't wait to see them again
one of my most memorable experiences
i guess that would be
scrubbed_entry
in florida
you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch
it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget
just because we'd been looking forward to it for you know so many months and
you know when it finally happened it was surreal
um
it was it was a great night after all and overall
sure you're welcome
bye
