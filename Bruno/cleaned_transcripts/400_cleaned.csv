value
yeah
i'm fine
um pacific grove california
um <sigh> the wholesale opportunities and uh all the stores and
anything i could ever ask for
<laughter> the uh traffic the the mood of the people and the
the unhealthy pace
um uh let's see i i did like culinary and then i did really good in art and music
in high school
uh through my own uh will and desire to want to
uh get involved with the music
uh no
uh open up a uh health practice of some sort
uh changing things in my life that uh had an impact on
myself and others for the for the benefit of health
uh when i have the opportunity
um <sigh>
buying things seeing the culture
relaxing not thinking about the city
ah well i i used to go to texas every every year uh with my dad during the summer and i always wanted to stay there and live there when i went on vacation
um most likely one of these trips to texas uh where we would go and spend time in the desert and shoot guns and ride go karts and stuff like that
<laughter> it was
uh let's see well um
my dad and i are uh
are not really talking that much and uh my mom passed away about two months ago
thanks
definitely more shy i've always been that way
uh <sigh>
eh just the personality that i've grown into but
learning how to adjust to the sensitivity and grow out of it
oh tea and um
you know eating i like to eat i mean that calms me down
uh eh
not that good when i get really upset it's usually a problem and i have to work to calm myself down and sometimes i just
don't
get on something and i don't stop
sometimes but i've learned to control it to that extent now
<laughter> yesterday
i was arguing about what sort <s> what kind of water we should be drinking
uh well a difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid
um
even though uh the other party's opinion was somewhat
misinformed
um definitely uh every day is a growing process i wish i would've handled everything differently every day which is what
um makes me grow and i
try to work toward how i would've wanted to handle things every day
little by little
um <sigh>
can't think of anyone right now
um <sigh>
i'd i'd i'd say uh not
supporting my friends as much with their
career choices
uh i'd rather not get into it <laughter>
therapy uh experts
have been really inspirational in the past two months
well uh they believe that
um the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and
this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study and
um
the sources of information that are uh that that are very good and i i think deserve respect based on
you know real research <laughter>
really easy i've uh almost got it down to a science
uh i'm tired
been feeling
better than i have in a long time
uh yeah i think it's uh due to the transition in the diet and
in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually you know
loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over
my short life time of
um
you know toxic choices with food and
drugs or whatever it would be
<deep breath> yes um less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and
more control over my
uh decisions and my wants versus what i need
that sort of thing
nope
yes to some extent
uh over five years ago
um <sigh> lack of motivation and
basically my my symptoms were
paralleling that of depression
uh loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear
of uh social situations
and uh
xxx the main four or five
no
uh i believe i overcomed a chapter in my life that was the the doctor
um
you know taking control of my health and
experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started
juicing more and um just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with the help of uh
the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that
yes
uh i believe therapy is useful because
um <sigh> without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that
um it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that
will just uh resonate in the subconscious until you you know it has an outburst it basically
um therapy um
will help in overall health and mental
health i believe
for everybody
last night um
i made a really great vegan uh
dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and
had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot and i almost converted them <laughter>
yeah
uh i would say uh
you know trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do
like my brain likes caffeine and sugar
whereas you know my body needs uh something other than that xxx
is an example
it's very very hard it's a daily process
um i was uh
handling money for uh a business partner and
they ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my formulas of
crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i made to the formula so
the blame was on me that i may have took money and i i automatically felt bad about that because of my
uneasy uh my uncertainty to the change of formula
um
no
twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to um
to start eating
raw fruits and vegetables every day
as calm and
um
sad maybe smart talented
um
i really enjoyed going to the uh wholesale food market in downtown los angeles
um <sigh> lots of food
uh great prices you can
eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price as going to a normal supermarket
so uh i i really get in a lot of enjoyment uh teaching people
how to uh maybe better themselves especially food-wise and what they're eating
uh eating and um
watching a really good t_v show
um
i'm insightful i can uh
i can adjust to people's uh
uh <sigh> i dunno i guess i'll skip that question for now
i'm most proud of um <sigh>
i'd say my overall situation with where i'm at right now i could've never imagined that i'd be in such a fortunate um situation
