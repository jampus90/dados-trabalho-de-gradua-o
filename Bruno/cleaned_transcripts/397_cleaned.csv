value
sure
i'm good but i caught a cold
morning <sniff>
l_a
<snort> born and raised born and raised
it's home <snort> food people culture
traffic
uh there's a lot of us <sigh>
too many of us probably
oh
<snort> i have in the past i haven't traveled lately
uh the destination i don't enjoy the traveling anymore at all i did when i was young but no longer <snort> it's the destination point
mm okay
<snort> uh in ninety two i went to spain
and my grandma my father's mother was born in spain i went back to trace her roots  <snort>
and i spent a week in madrid a week in barcelona and a week in majorca
<sniff> had a great time
i enjoyed it
ooh
it was a an everyday thing people were friendly uh
finding out that some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting
<snort> uh i studied uh poly sci and uh sociology
uh <sigh>
well at the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do
no no
uh <sigh>
well i had my dream job for a while i was doing sports research for uh native american tribes
<snort> but uh yeah
i enjoyed it
but that's uh it's not as uh
as often as it was <clears throat>
mainly because of the uh
the sports bureaus that exist now that didn't exist when i started
i still when i do i still enjoy it
uh <sigh>
i'll be what <wh> what i'll be what suits me in any given situation
uh listen to music
uh i like oldies
jazz
mm soft music
uh i've learned to do it well i wasn't wasn't always that way but i've learned to do it well
by when by arguing i assume you mean words uh
with my youngest daughter it was about uh a year and a half ago
uh well it was it stemmed over an incident i didn't like what the
the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her she got
extremely defensive and rather than deal with it she became she became angry with me <snort>
i was mad
uh three girls
thirty eight thirty seven thirty one
uh three granddaughters
eleven fourteen eighteen so i haven't won an argument in a long time
but i adore all six of 'em
uh
well now i don't really consider myself a parent <snort> since mine are grown my baby is thirty one and you never lose that but i mean i'm not parenting at this point  in my life
i'm enjoying my grandchildren
when i was a parent yeah it's a difficult challenge
is uh
getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand and don't understand
and not putting your your stuff in front of theirs
the hugs
well my dad was was physical uh in those days you know uh nobody called child services if you got hit
uh
uh my mother was very loving but my dad well you know he he'd raise his hand to you if he thought it would it would uh disappoint you <snort> i never did that
adored my mother <sigh> my dad uh was a hard guy
but i loved him
uh
i never felt abused by him but i mean
i the one thing i remember he said when you when you're capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house
that's my that's kinda the the basis of our relationship
my mother
my kids my grandkids
well i'm i'm one of i'm one of three <sigh> three sons
<clear throat> so i really didn't have any experience with females other than uh with my mother in terms of being you know related
and my grandma
and then when my first daughter was born it was like wow <snort> that was it i fell madly in love with her
changed my life
yeah well that's the way it happened
uh <sigh>
when my mother got sick i i wasn't <wa> i wasn't there for her the way i should've been
and i don't feel good <goo>
oh yeah you can always fix what you did in the end <snort>
i was just in a real bad situation
but that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there the way i shold've been
at least not in my mind
uh <sigh>
uh my second marriage probably she uh
she wanted to have uh children and i already had my children with my first wife
and uh
i i had i had told her initially that i did not wanna have children and you know i had three
uh that and i was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children <sniff> so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant
and our relationship changed and
i basically wouldn't relent and we ended up getting divorved
uh i i i don't know that i would've had children <chil> would've
would've had children with her but i
i wasn't very flexible in the process
what to be flexible
i don't know
sometimes i am sometimes i'm not
uh
that'd been pulling my uh
pulling my father out of off uh uh life support
i just kept going back to something he said to me when i was uh younger
that he would come back and haunt me and
if i you know if i let him lay there lay there and suffer
it took me a while to convince my other two brothers but  that's what we did
something i could erase from my memory
uh being locked up for a while
i'd like to erase that from my memory <snort>
it's just
it's an everyday hell
where there's very little humanity
and uh
you even do some things that you're not proud of
i've never slept i've never slept a lot and i'm one of those people that  if i wake up i have a hard time going back to sleep
so it's it's difficult <diffi> it's uh
i'm pretty much still the same
i don't change
so so i had friend <f> uh
things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the little incident with my granddaughter <granddaugh> uh my youngest daughter but i had a friend recently who was uh
runned over in a crosswalk and uh he's on
he's on life support so i haven't been feeling too good about that
it's it's affected me
it wasn't like he was jaywalking or anything he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the break so
and he's on uh life support at this point
mm no not really only consistent thing about me is i'm very inconsistent
uh no
no
but i've had moments where i felt i was i was depressed
okay i was talking when you were talking so i didn't hear the question
uh uh yesterday
had a conversation with my fourteen year-old granddaughter
i'm happy i have moments of happiness every day 'cause i i either speak to or
text with uh my daughters and granddaughters every day
even if
we're upset with one another
oh i have a lot of regrets
uh
i should've went to law school
that's that's kinda something i thought yeah began to think about more in my lifetime
i was accepted i just didn't i had other other things i thought i wanted to do <snort>
uh <sigh> uh i i played with uh wanting to be uh uh a kicker for football on a football team
had some tryouts things like that
but they didn't pan out
and as as that didn't pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer
so i just did other things
i don't think it'd make that much difference i probably wouldn't listen to myself <snort>
um about myself uh <hums>
uh
i could be uh
if i don't like you i could be very uh very difficult
if i don't like you
i'd very much like to change that
it has in the past yeah <snort>
well i have this theory that you could make me feel bad about myself only if i let you
and i'm not real big on letting <let> letting people do that to me uh although my first wife when
when she left me with the children <snort> she you know that it was my fault
and i wasn't sure that i believed that but i knew i was an ass
and and uh
but i probably believed it and not in its totality but in part <snort>
<sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judgemental uh uh i would listen to anybody
uh
whether i agree with you or disagree with you
uh
uh i've taught myself to uh
control anger that i that i have uh
and uh if if i've called you my friend or if i tell you i love you uh i mean it it's that's not something that i do uh
casually
<snort> uh oh okay well i i played eighteen holes of golf with a
with an old dear friend and we got caught up and
uh <sigh>
we four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner
met his new wife uh had a good time
a lot of a lot of memories came back
mm
<snort> uh well i like i like my my kids <ki> uh my grandkids i like that you know i like the hell out of them
i don't know if all kids are like that i i think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology but
but that's me mainly 'cause i don't
but if my grandkids are any any uh sampling of it i think they're good i think they're pretty good
raising my girls
basically by myself with the help of my mother
i think that's the uh most proud of
or
okay nice chatting with you
bye
