value
yes
i'm good thank you
um i was born in mexico city
yes
um about thirty four years ago
yeah <laughter>
um i try to go back once a year but i haven't been in about three years
um i haven't had the time and i've traveled to other places but i'm planning on going back probably next year
um well i can't ever see myself moving back to mexico city it's a huge huge city and
i like l_a more there's more opportunities and
i just feel at home here
my family moved here um i like i said <s> i was very young and my parents moved um to california to work and then we just stayed here
um i love traveling i have not traveled as much as i would like to um but i do love to travel
um just seeing new things meeting people from other countries just um
feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation
um i just love being
in other places
um the last trip i took was a seven day cruise
and it went to saint thomas barbados saint lucia
um
saint martin
and it was amazing i would love to do that trip again
um
i think <sigh> going to mexico the last time i was there
i went to the pyramids teotihuacan and i had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see
the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such great um structures
uh i consider myself more shy
um in social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable
um i'm not one to just
go up to people and start conversations
um if people come up to me of course i'll talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just
kind of out of place at a party
um i actually studied history
um i've always been interested in history
and i just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course u_s history
so i'm very into uh history
um i'm actually working in uh the education field
my dream job would actually be um traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel <laughter> that would be my dream job because i would get paid to travel and it's something i enjoy to do
doing
um
so i would love to do that as a job
um i love reading
and i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bath
and um i also like going to the gym that helps me uh
deal with stress and
it actually relaxes me even though i'm exercising
um
i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily
and sometimes as an adult i still get angry
easily but i've gotten a lot better at
trying to think about things first before saying them and
not having outbursts
things like that
um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend
and she actually she has kids i don't
and for some reason she thought
or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and
she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things
um i don't think i've ever made her feel that
i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it
um
well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because
when she was talking to me she was very upset and
i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her
but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling
match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and
maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument
um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation
i felt that maybe i could've just let her
let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly
um instead of yelling at her too
oh wow um
that's a tough one i think um
gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years
um
although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was
kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and
i kinda felt by ending the relationship um
i would've wasted those last seven years of my life
it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did
because then i went on to meet um
my husband
thank you
um well about i would say
maybe
fifteen years ago i was
hanging out with a couple of friends at a
club
and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place
and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it
but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them
and
back at their house um
one of the guys
actually pulled me into a room and
tried
i i got scared i yelled
he tried to choke me and i thought
i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me
but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left
so
it could've been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind
it was
um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother
um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older
and we get along pretty well
um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now we're actually closer i think than ever
and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents
um my dad
still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes <laughter> which annoys me
but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship
yeah
um <sigh> i usually wake up
a few times throughout the night
um
so
i think it's rare for me to sleep
uh the whole night through ever
um and i do feel a little
like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely
um
so yeah it's kinda hard to get a good night's sleep
um i don't know it
i have a hard time falling asleep
and then sometimes i have bad dreams or
i need to get up to use the restroom um
but yeah it
i don't remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once
um
emotionally good
um i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice
um
physically i feel good i haven't been to the gym in a while so that kinda
makes me feel
bad um 'cause i like working out
um but health wise i'm good <laughter>
no
no
um
it was
last <la> this past weekend i actually went out of town with my husband
we didn't go very far we went to santa barbara but
we really enjoyed ourselves um we went wine tasting and
went to the beach and just had a really good time
um she would probably describe me as a good caring person
um
patient
very shy
um
she'd probably say too that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors 'cause i'm always doing things for other people
um so yeah that's how i think she would describe me
i wish i was more outgoing
um
i wish that
i
what else
definitely more outgoing
um
so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i am very shy
um i also wish that i could have more patience than i do <laughter> sometimes i'm very short of patience
and um i wish i could
find a better job so i could do more traveling
um
yes i actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree
and i really wish that i could've
you know taken care of it a lot sooner than i did
um
and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend
um i would've told myself to stay focused on school that
going out and hanging out and just
you know
and going to parties um was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first
um i'm proud that after so many years of not being in school i was able to
go to u_c_l_a and get my degree
um
yeah that would be my proudest achievement
okay
thank you
bye
