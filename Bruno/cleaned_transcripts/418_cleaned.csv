um
and i have a fish tank too so i like to watch my fish
also like to play tennis when i can i haven't been able to play lately though because of physical problems
um
mm
it's just that um
i had injured uh my my my ankle because i have anemia <aneenia> and um
and i got dizzy one night and i fell on my ankle and on my leg and so i'm just waiting for that to really heal
but i'm planning to get back um into tennis it's one of the things i enjoy doing it really relaxes me
i really don't have a temper over the years i've learned how to do how to control that
probably would've been yesterday but there was no argument
and what was it about
nothing that i can recall <laughter>
something i feel guilty about
hm
there's nothing right now that i feel guilty about
mm
oh a situation that i wish i had handled differently
i really can't think of one right now
the hardest decision oh
um
the absolute hardest decision that i ever had to make
um
was when my uh i had twins twin twin twin boys they're grown now
i had twins
twin teen teenagers
and um i had lost my job and we were living in a motel
and
the rent for the motel was outrageous i couldn't no longer continue to pay the
um pay the type the type of money that they wanted so i had to briefly um
um
put my son under the in in foster care for for for a minute
that was the hardest decision that i had to make
scrubbed_entry
um a schizophrenic
and he had had
um he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hearing when he was four years old
um but
and then when he turned fourteen the schizophrenia came up
um so right now he he's in a supportive living environment he's twenty seven years old
um but he he he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now
i had problems in the past 'cause he didn't wanna take the medication you'd give him the medication and he'd hide it stick it in his pocket or whatever
so but he's come to terms with that and we've all have come to terms with that and he's doing he's doing pretty good
scrubbed_entry
um that son he's twenty <twen> he's twenty seven as i said 'cause he's a twin
um
um was living in texas with his wife
and um he got a promotion to um
scrubbed_entry
now he's in california too both are in california okay so
um
i feel very good about that yeah
uh
hm
well of grown children yes
<laughter> of grown children yes
no no no no no no no
no i take that back
not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger there were difficult times okay difficult periods and um
just it was a lot of good times too but yeah it was there were some difficult times
mm
well the mm the difficult times i really pretty much already alluded to and that was when um one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and um
and um
they were in
temporarily and
in in well one was in foster care and one was actually um in a institution 'cause of the um the um schizophrenia
um
so
think i lost track of the question <laughter>
the hardest thing about being a parent
at this point at this <the> at this point in my life there is is nothing hard about it
um
the best thing about being a parent
i don't know i guess it's just to see <cough>
something that you created um develop into a you know pretty decent human being you know a decent person
that's the best thing
oh a lot of ways
um well actually
i didn't have two parents i had a mother
and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him um
but the thing that i do
differently than what my mother did
um
she was a strong disciplinarian
um both verbally and physically
um
and
she at she had this tendency which she outgrew
she had this tendency to be very critical okay critical and um
um opinionated <laughter> and very religious
um
and sort of
sort of looked at people who were not and that was me um as if they
were living life wrong because they were not going to church or reading the bible and that kind of thing
what was the other part
of the question
i i i don't get a good night's sleep or i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is to it if i don't take medication i don't sleep i'll be up all night i'll
i will be up for days if i don't take medication
man irritable um
and tired <laughter>
well well
lately
you know just a little anxious really um
you know um i just recently um
made a move to a new apartment it's a lot of expenses and
new expenses and things like that you know and new furniture and new this and that that you have to get which um i've i managed to do all of that but
um the whole thing was kind of stressful
yes mhm
no not p_t_s_d
yes
um that was back in i think two thousand and four
um
because um my life had gotten so stressful
to the point where
it was either i had to do something or
or end something to tell you the truth yeah
um yes mhm
yeah i think it's useful um you know as a good sounding board
you know someone to throw
you know your concerns out and you know discuss things that may be bothering you or good things too yeah i think therapy with medication
um
since i've been going to therapy
um the changes
a lot of changes um
i've been more focused
more
hopeful
um
hm
it it's just been a good experience for me which is why i continue to go
really happy
well
i can feel really happy
um by some occurrence i can't think of anything right now just like that
and then
i go back to how i was feeling
so i can't really pinpoint anything really i mean
eh eh i mean if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time
that that makes me happy when things go right how about that
hm
mm something i did recently
that i really
something i did recently that i really enjoyed
mean really really enjoyed
recently
hm
i can't think of anything
i don't have a best friend
um my best qualities
are that
i'm a honest person
i genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt
um everyone in my book
is as they appear to be
until they prove prove it differently
um
i'm very generous
overly generous <laughter>
um
and i'm very i like to help other people
i mean help you know i'm on a personal level help people
you know with anything whatever their problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out
mhm
anything i regret
how so
there's only one thing i regret and that is that
um
after my twins became um became old enough to um
start going to um school the elementary school level um
i was taking some courses um as a pre law major
and um
at that time i was married to their father
who who turned out not to be a good
fit for me
and
because of the stresses involved with him
you know knowing that that was gonna end and i was gonna leave him
um
i dropped out of college
so that was my biggest regret
hm
stay in school no matter what
stay the course no matter what
that i'm a good person
i'm a good human being
that's all
okay
goodbye
