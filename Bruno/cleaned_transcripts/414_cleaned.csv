value
yeah
i'm okay
burbank california
yeah
the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather
um
it's not too
city like chicago or new york
it's um it's big enough we have beaches we're not land locked woo
sometimes the smog
the traffic
the fact that i've just been here like my entire life almost
not enough as i'd like to i go to school in chicago
and i've been to new york a couple times
san francisco and i took a road trip across the country
that was cool i saw a couple states
seeing new places
um
going to landmarks that i've only
read about or seen pictures of
um
i traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route sixty six
and the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time
it was
the coolest thing i've ever seen probably <laughter>
happy
and then just happy it was it was beautiful it was nice
i haven't felt like that in a long time
i was studying film
it's just
something i've always loved for as long as i can remember and when it came time to start
applying to schools i wasn't sure what i wanted to do
and um
i applied to northwestern as a film student
and it just ended up being the right decision
ooh <laughter>
um
i love making movies
but part of me really loves
making people laugh and being in front of the camera
so
uh
comedian a comedic <comie> <laughter> comedic actor would be totally great but
that's hard <laughter>
i am super outgoing
and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually <laughter>
i um
i like to watch mindless television
like um
toddlers in tiaras and um
duck dynasty just t_v programs where i really don't have to pay attention at all
i'm okay at it
i
get really
emotional really fast but i am usually
able to
to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff
for the most part
sometimes
i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily
and i hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long
um
my best friend <laughter> ryan i think
and it was about
our relationship and just
how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and
uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before
really hard
it's um
he's my best friend and i miss him
but
we messed up and it's just it's not the same
it's like not the same friendship <laughter>
me too <laughter>
<laughter> too many um
i guess
scrubbed_entry
when i had a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend
which was not okay
i wish i would've just
realized that this was bad
and just would've stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my break up
and then our friendship being really messed up
i guess not spend as much time with him as i did
be more assertive
um
i guess
it was
in november
i was very depressed and suicidal
so i told my friend
what i was feeling
and that she needed to take me to the e_r
and from the e_r i had the choice to
i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital
and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i
decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever
um
<exhale> it was awful
it was in chicago and um
it was scary
i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just
start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was
mostly men and um they were all really old
and
it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter>
so that was pretty scary and i just um
it was really hard for me <laughter>
i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies
about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work
i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and
i wasn't talking to any of my friends and
i was
drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and
i was just in a really bad place
and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help
it was
um
i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager
and i tried to kill myself then
and i um got put in therapy for quite some time
so
i figured i don't want to go down
that bad path again
i just wanna get better
so i had to do it i had to get help
i do i go once a week
i feel like if you have the right therapist
it's really useful
i had one therapist that i really liked
and i thought we could've gone really far but
sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to
i have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay
she's not
we're not
that great together but she's who i had right now
it's better than nothing <laughter>
not that easy at all
um
ever since <yawn>
i got out of the hospital and start
and i began medication for my depression
i um
just haven't been able to sleep well
falling asleep is hard staying <laughter> asleep is hard
have really
crazy vivid dreams
that wake me up and are disturbing
um
i guess just
sometimes they reflect
things that i'm worried about
or happening in my life but they're just
they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen
and it's usually no you dreamed that
sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up
probably <laughter> like two nights ago
that is a
hard question
i think
in november <yawn>
after i got out of the hospital
i finally had one good day
and my friend took me into
downtown chicago
and we went to the sears tower
and got to look
over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool
<laughter> um probably
super outgoing
likes to be the center of attention
funny and a little bit crazy
i try not to regret things in my life
oh
um
i would say that
living is worth it
and just don't be afraid to ask for help
when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad
um i guess my ideal weekend would be <laughter>
sleeping in and then
catching a movie with my friends
maybe going home with them and
bake some cookies <laughter> eat all the cookies
watch some t_v have a sleep over
and then like make pancakes in the morning
and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do that <laughter> in my free time
go for a walk i don't know go to the beach <laughter>
um that is a hard question
i mean i think i've
done a lot of great things in my life
and um
i have achieved a lot
but
i think one of the proudest things
proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant
i was doing this exercise boot camp and
the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like
thirty push ups and
it was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone wanna help him if someone helps him you have to do half each
and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start doing push ups with him
and i just
it wasn't 'cause i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good i just did it
and no one really knows about that but it just i feel really good about that
it was nice
it meet you <laughter> bye
