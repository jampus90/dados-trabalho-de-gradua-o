value
yes
i'm feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good
i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there
and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county
about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm twenty three now so
it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've been living there yeah
some things that that i really like i would have to say you know
the beach
um you know
not so much the traffic don't really care for that but um
definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know
just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah
right
yep
yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot
i've been to places like hawaii
been to the caribbean
i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth>
um you know just different places like
arizona i've been to oregon washington
pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so
yep <clears throat>
um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture
um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery
it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say
something that you know people haven't seen before so
well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time
new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands
we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu
uh maui you know places like that so
yep
um you know i would have to say that
um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor
just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so
yeah
i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester
so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months
yep
well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college
and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting
but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me
so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but
you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know
kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories
i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so
yep
my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting
sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine
so
my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still
like i said i'm twenty three years old
um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but
for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so
things are uh you know
getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well
you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle
you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back
other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but
you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before
so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know
i can either be talk very talkative
or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and
so
um you know usually um
i would listen to music
or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive
or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know
ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy
so
you know i've actually been better with that
um couple years back you know i
there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just
pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but
you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing
and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat>
well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but
you know it's it's always something so miniscule that
that's why i probably don't remember it
but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that
you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances
yeah
something that i feel guilty about
um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing
but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice
hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent
kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got
diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough
and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be
so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies
he could be a little you know
crazy
so
probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah
yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back
been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old
so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to
i don't i don't  you know
try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah
my best friend
<laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy
usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too
um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny
um i like to hang out you know just
kinda
do things here and there you know just
normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah
<clears throat
you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep
i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know
my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough
so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part
i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat>
lately eh
been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up
i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago
for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that
um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good
and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat>
yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but
you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part
i have not
no
nope
no
last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still
still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave
so you know we were just hanging out
um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so
i felt great you know it
because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything
can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like
that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so
yeah
yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret
um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about
three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time
you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances
that took place
so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it
but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said
it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way
well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if
i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just
be careful you know
make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be
um
basically you know just always be nice be honest
um just be caring toward others so
um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing
i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so
yeah
my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends
um either you know we hang out in the day
you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers
um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so
some things that i wish i could change
um
probably just you know be nicer like i said before
um
maybe not being as lazy have more determination
i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life
but i know there are times when i i kinda
get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so
um well you know it's it's tough to think back
but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know
i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have
i was trying to give more constructive criticism but
at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and
they were out of character so
my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined
i'm very caring now
more than i used to be
very honest
and you know i i just i love to talk to people
like i like making new relationships
i like making people laugh <clears throat>
something that i did recently that i really enjoyed
um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two
and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so
i feel accomplished about that
you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there
you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that
so
makes me feel good yep
um you know just let's see eh few different stories eh just
usually things about well the the paper's in long beach so it's usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah
i would say that i'm most proud of you know graduating
high school about to graduate college
hopefully you know obviously i'm gonna earn a degree and then hopefully get a you know a good solid job
you know in the near future
i think that's one thing that i'm most proud of
thank you
