since forever
uh just you know i have all my family here my mom my dad my cousins aunts uncle so

i mean it would be nice to visit but
you know it just does my curiousity hasn't you know gone there i guess
oh okay
um i love the people everyone's nice i love the diversity you know there's different types of
people and you know the imaginations out there everything is just great
you know everyone's different you know no one's like the same at at least to some aspects
um and i love the scenery i love the you know mountains they're beautiful
you know great for hikes you know taking out you know the dog the family you know
it's nice it's pretty active yeah
uh the smog <laughter>
uh i don't like the smog it's just
you know if you go out um further out you know you could tell by the air you know or
you know everything's clearer the sky is bluer <laughter> um but other than that like you know and traffic <laughter> nobody likes traffic i think
yeah
yeah but um
yeah that's you know pretty much l_a is pretty nice you know it's i like it
um
well i was studying just basic you know um i'm not sure exactly what i wanna be so it's just kind of you know
here and there just jumping through hoops and stuff so
not really
set yet it's just i'm still trying to find my interests i suppose
so
um my dream job hm
that's a good one
um i love working with children so i would say probably a child psychologist just 'cause you know it's great
you know to learn what's going on in the young minds
and you know how we could help children develop a better way
you know make children you know or help
you know help them you know grow up in a positive way i supposed instead of like going the wrong track
yeah
i just you know help children
uh it depends it depends on the situation i'm in sometimes you know i could be like super outgoing and just like you know
and sometimes like it just i could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention you know if i'm like in class or whatever
i don't really like and there's everyone talking i just i'd prefer just to
stay away from that you know 'cause i need something else to concentrate on something else you know there's like a moment and time for everything i suppose
yeah
um
i like to kick my feet up on the couch and like read a good book you know just
get my mind going to another you know
galaxy or universe or
situation you know it's pretty fun you know just
you know reading and then just having just
yourself relaxed and you know feeling good
yeah it is it's just fun i love reading
um
i'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know temper controlling person there is out there
you know i try my best and i guess that's all i could do until i keep
doing better eventually
but i'm not like the best
i mean i sometimes i do have my outbursts you know um
but you know i guess that's everyone
i'm not sure haha you know
uh huh
that's a good question
um hm
i don't remember <laughter> uh let's see uh
honestly i can't recall maybe
uh
my goodness
i i don't know <laughter> i've i've uh sometimes i'm very passive that i'll just like let things go 'cause i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things
you know so um
huh i don't know
i'm not i i i can't honestly i can't tell you that <laughter> at this moment
sure yeah probably come back to it
um
huh
well i guess
when i was younger i you know uh could've been better older sister and i i wasn't
and that makes me feel guilty for sure
you know i could've been a better sister
better role model <laughter> you know but i'm trying my best now so i'm trying to make things better
and it's working <laughter>
yeah
woo um i guess huh
hm
i don't know i mean
i'm the person that i am because of the events that have happened in my life so
if i erase something then it just there's something of me in my present self or you know that would change and
i don't know i'm pretty okay with the person that i am now i mean
you know i don't think i would change an event
you know i'm i'm okay with what
you know ups and downs and good and bad that has happened
so
yeah
uh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot um
but i am kind of like an explorer i guess i love to explore like
even the smallest things like if i go hiking i go off trail and you know just find my way up to the top
you know somehow some way and just make it
you know um traveling
uh i would love to do that but
i don't know just you know
always circumstances in my life that
doesn't you know always something you know i'm getting married children you know and all this
so it's kind of like you know
it would be nice i guess you know
it would be nice

um
hm it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice it was just me and him you know and it was like no one and it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake and

i don't know just you know just i'm laying there and i'm just like trying to go to sleep and i'm just like ugh but eventually i do <laughter> you know i just i probably like need to
position myself on a different side of the bed like sometimes i'm i'm in the headboard and i'm like ah i gotta go to the other side and
once i position myself then i just like go to sleep you know
but it just i gotta find the position <pos> the right position for me
yeah
um
i'm tired <laughter> i get tired throughout throughout the day you know but
i kind of try to shake it off you know and just kind of like
feel like it's a new day you know and just try to make the day that i have as great as possible
you know and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of <laughter> you know
so yeah yeah yeah it's just
you know
it's okay i try to make it the best i guess
if not then i just go to sleep throughout the day which sucks
but yeah

oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time <laughter> i've never really like uh you know but yeah i've yeah very happy
uh
um
i don't know um i guess just me myself i uh you know like
you know i could you know just be myself and that's it you know just i can't really
you know say i have specific thing i guess i mean it depends on the person that meets me
to tell me i can't really tell myself like oh i'm this i'm that just you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to tell me or you know compliment me or what not
yeah
um
<laughter> nothing i think <laughter> um
like i said i'm i'm happy with the person i am right now
and you know my flaws or whatever you know i might have whatever flaw people see in me and it'ts okay you know i'm okay with it
whatever it just
i'm not gonna i'm
i can't change myself for the likings of other people <laughter> i have only one body and one life so yeah
yeah that's it
uh
just my childhood with my sisters and my family but
you know it's you know i you learn from that
you learn from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve
um
just smile and be happy
you know and whatever hard things happen you know you're gonna get through them eventually you know
the only thing you can't um
i don't know you can't
you know
go back on is death you know you could you know the heartbreak or it's whatever but you know as long as i'm alive i'm just i still gotta keep going

i guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know i i'm
you know i try to be
you know
a better person each day and try to like
you know improve myself every day
as much as i can
you know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know
as much as i can
very hard <laughter> i'm not gonna lie um it is really hard you know 'cause i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know
and you know it's it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but
you know it's just it's it's sometimes
you know hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try <laughter> you know
so yeah
um
you know
loving friendly um outgoing you know adventurous i guess i don't know i guess that's what they say <laughter> i i just you know that's them like
you know but that's what at least what i try to be
you know at least i try to
give a the best foot forward always
as much as possible you know even
sometimes even if i'm having a rough day i'm just like uh you know
you know i just i don't wanna take it out on anyone or anything you know
yeah
um <laughter> my ideal weekend

i like sitting down in like a tree under a tree actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like
put my blanket out there have my dog and
like read a book and you know sometimes
if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know
just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the
noise <n> noise i guess 'cause there's not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it's just it's really neat
yeah
